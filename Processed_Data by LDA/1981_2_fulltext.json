A joke by a former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development that the housing industry was invented to take crap shooting out of the streets and back alleys reflects the uncertainties of the industry. **********Recent predictions that annual housing starts will soon fall below one million units indicate that production of housing is being reduced even though need for shelter has not been met for many people. Most families are unable to afford new housing if they are first-time buyers, or to find rental housing. At the same time, interest rates and falling prices of existing housing have reduced the profitable liquidity of the family residence on which many have relied for the last few years. **********Little low- and moderate- or middle-income rental housing has been built in recent years without Federal assistance, and high costs and budget cuts have reduced the number of units being built with Federal funds. Although public housing for low- and moderate-income people continues to be built, there is also continuing abandonment of large numbers of low-income units in urban areas. **********Thus the middle class and the poor cannot find suitable housing because of the high cost of home ownership and rentals and because of a shortage of units. **********Despite growing shelter problems for the middle class and the poor and depression in the housing industry, the Federal response continues to be ad hoc, with no determination of a basic policy for meeting the needs of the 80's. Stated national policy is still limited to that of the basic housing statutes that articulate the right of every American to ''decent, safe and sanitary housing.'' On that fragile policy base, various housing programs, some as old as public housing and the Federal Housing Administration, and some as new as Section VIII rental assistance, have been authorized and reauthorized. **********In 1977, the Carter Administration enunciated a policy that the Federal Government would use Federal housing programs to promote stability in the housing industry. But that policy died at the next budget cycle when it became clear that the cost of assisted housing at stable unit levels would result in budget figures unacceptable to the President. For the rest of the Carter Administration, as with those before and after, housing policy had to be sought in budget and administrative decisions made for the myriad housing programs. **********Even an early effort by H.U.D. in the Carter years to codify the rambling and often contradictory housing statutes of the department was defeated by the absence of an executive and legislative consensus on the validity of existing programs. And for four straight years Congress voted less money for authorized Federal housing programs than was requested in the Carter budgets (and housing was one of the few areas in which Congress reduced President Reagan's budget). **********Such absence of consensus about national housing programs and policy is not new.  Federal housing programs, like Topsy, just grew, largely as a result of bad compromises of good program proposals or of brainstorms or idiosyncrasies of individual legislators or civil servants. **********A few weeks ago, another Federal commission was established to advise the President on national housing policy. It will join similar groups of the last decade in succumbing to pressures of budget cycles and problems of runaway costs of existing programs in deciding on its recommendations. **********Therefore, in addition to such a Presidential commission, there is need for a disinterested institution, such as a foundation, to conduct an intensive and extensive study of the present housing scene; its relationship to a troubled economy; the proper role of the Federal Government in providing housing, with particular attention to fiscal policy; the responsibilities of different levels of government, and the role of the private sector. **********That housing programs of the past have worked is proved by the housing programs for the elderly and the venerable F.H.A., but there is room for imagination and development of new approaches. **********There must be enunciation of a reasonable and comprehensive national housing policy before the shortage of housing in the United States spawns squatter movements such as those in Europe. We are not at that point (except, perhaps, for Philadelphia), but there are indications that we could reach it. We have the time and resources to develop a national housing policy not tied solely to budget issues. **********If we develop such a policy, we could be certain of finding ways to insure decent shelter for our citizens into the 21st century, and at the same time we would end the dice game that the housing industry has become. ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Leonard Silk is on vacation.

They say the basic intention of the talks is to elaborate a party statute that will define the rules for political activity, draw up a new constitutuion to be approved in a national referendum and hold general elections at the end of 1984. The Military Proposal **********Politicians said the military proposed that a commission formed by three high-ranking military officers and six members from each of the parties be established to draw up the party statute. They said the military stipulated that the representatives in clude three members from each party who supported Governm ent-proposed constitutional changes that were defeated in a referendum last November. **********The Government's surprise defeat in the vote on the new constitution, which would have given the military a permanent place in government, precipitated the move toward elections. **********The Colorado Party immediately proposed six names, but the Blanco Party sought further clarification from the military on whether certain names would be acceptable, politicians said. There has been no reply. **********President Alvarez, noted for his planning ability and his independence from any power group, has been maneuvering quietly to build support in the army, according to politicians. **********''Many Uruguayans feel that General Alvarez would like to stand as a candidate in the 1984 elections and that he will not tackle the political situation until he has solved the country's economic problems and made sure of military support,'' one political source said. Parties Are Suspicious **********The traditional parties are suspicious of military intentions, and politicians say the climate of repression has hardened since General Alvarez's takeover. They say politicians are being harassed and cite the closure of the Blanco Party's weekly magazine, Democracia, as a bad omen. The Government last month ordered the magazine to suspend publication for four weeks, saying it had incited disturbances and printed state ments by proscribed politicians. **********One obstacle in negotiations could be the military's insistence that the National Security Council, comprising the President, commanders of the three armed forces and the Ministers of the Interior, Defense and Foreign Affairs, be given sufficient powers to safeguard national security. **********The Government recently lifted a ban that had kept several hundred thousand people from voting, holding Government office or engaging in political activity. Among prominent politicians still proscribed are Jorge Batlle Ibanez, who could emerge as the Colorado leader, all members of the leftist Broad Front Movement, which is considered the third political force in the county, and several leaders of the Blanco Party. **********There is little difference between the two traditional parties and both have moderate leftist and rightist factions.

Hugh Liedtke, now chairman of the Pennzoil Company, were sitting around their offices in the west Texas oil town of Midland, wondering what to name their fledgling drilling business. **********They wanted something that would attract attention, something exotic, something that began with A or Z so it would be easy to find in the phone book. Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn had just made a hit movie called ''Viva Zapata!'' **********So Zapata it became, and the company has been attracting attention ever since. By 1966, when both Mr. Bush and Mr. Liedtke had sold their interests, the Zapata Corporation had become one of the world's biggest offshore drilling contractors. **********Last month the Occidental Petroleum Corporation offered to buy Zapata for $745 million in stock, but this time the company did not change hands. Armand Hammer, Occidental's chairman, withdrew the bid after Zapata rejected it as ''grossly inadequate.'' Strong Defensive Position **********Dr. Hammer said he had no intention of attempting a hostile takeover. One reason, analysts suggest, may have been that Zapata, profitable and in a position to line up sizable credit lines, is well equipped to put up a vigorous fight. **********That has not always been the case. In the years after the company's founders left, Zapata enthusiastically branched out into shipping, construction, dredging and mining. By the late 1970's, it found itself saddled with a string of weak operations, return on investment as low as 1 percent and a debt that had soared to $652 million, almost three times the value of the company's equity. **********Zapata's turnaround began in 1979, following the forced departure of its chairman, William H. Flynn. The new chairman, B. John Mackin, set out to return the company to its base in the oil business by getting rid of unrelated operations. **********The ''touchstone of our strategy,'' Mr. Mackin said the other day as the morning sun shone through the slanting glass windows of his office atop Pennzoil Place in downtown Houston, is simply to ''redeploy our assets to more profitable areas.'' Phase One: Divestitures **********The divestitures, described by Mr. Mackin as phase one of the company's restructuring, have included the sale of Zapata's tuna fishing business for $12 million and four oil tankers for $90 million. **********The company has also signed a letter of intent to sell its coal holdings in Pennsylvania and eastern Kentucky to subsidiaries of W.R. Grace & Company, the Hanna Mining Company and an affiliate of the Liberty Capital Group. The proposed purchase price has not been disclosed, but figures of more than $100 million have been mentioned. **********Phase two, Mr. Mackin said, will be the acquisition of new businesses to reduce the cyclical nature of Zapata's earnings. His immediate concern is that the current brisk pace of oil rig construction will mean an oversupply of rigs that will lead to a slump in the drilling business by the end of next year. **********''We haven't gotten to the point of determining what we're interested in and where we're going to go to find it,'' Mr. Mackin said. A management team is now working to set new objectives. Careful Choices Stressed **********The resulting strategy, Mr. Mackin conceded, may look like a move down the same diversification path that got the company into trouble during the late 1960's and early 1970's. But he argues that the problem then was not expansion into new businesses but the nature of the businesses selected. **********''I don't think there's anything we've done that could be used as a basis for the contention that conglomeration is bad,'' the Zapata chairman said. ''We're talking about a particular mix.'' **********For now, four activities, all related to oil and natural gas, are the core of Zapata's operations. These activities are offshore drilling, marine support services for offshore drilling, dredging and, finally, oil and gas exploration and production. Only two activities unrelated to energy remain: a fish-processing operation on the Gulf and Pacific coasts and a herring and sardine cannery in Maine that is up for sale. **********With its divestiture program nearly complete, the company's debt has been reduced to about $400 million while the value of its equity has increased to almost the same figure. With 19 mobile rigs scattered around the world, Zapata is the fifth-largest offshore drilling contractor in the world. Its large-vessel marine supply fleet ranks as No.4. Progress in New Sector **********The company has only recently moved into exploration and production. ''We're not a factor in that business yet,'' Mr. Mackin said, ''but we're quite satisfied with our progress in that direction.'' **********The corporate restructuring and the biggest oil-drilling boom in American history have had a dramatic impact on Zapata's bottom line.  The company's net income in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1980, was $43.6 million, or $2.19 a share, up 103 percent from a year earlier.  That gain came on a 21 percent increase in revenues, to a total of $637 million. The return on equity rose to 18 percent after having averaged 7.6 percent for the previous five years. **********Results for the fiscal year 1981, which ended two weeks ago, will not be announced until next month, but Mr. Mackin said the report could be expected to show another ''significant'' gain. **********''We're reaching the point in the evolution of our operation where we have our immediate objectives almost behind us,'' Mr. Mackin said. ''I think we have re-established credibility in the marketplace.'' Praise From Analysts **********Others agree. ''They've gotten their finances into shape, and they have good management,'' said one Wall Street analyst who asked not to be identified. **********George Faspar, an analyst who follows Zapata for Robert W. Baird & Company of Milwaukee, recently reported that Zapata had made ''extraordinary progress,'' that it was ''well positioned to see offshore and rig marine service revenues advance dramatically in the next two years'' and that its earnings momentum should continue in the fiscal year 1982."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/06/world/yugoslav-province-chief-quits-over-ethnic-riots.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yugoslav Province Chief Quits Over Ethnic Riots", "print_headline": "Yugoslav Province Chief Quits Over Ethnic Riots", "body_text": " **********Mahmut Bakali, the Communist Party leader in riot-troubled Kosovo Province, resigned today after a report accused the province's leaders of responsibility for separatist riots last month by ethnic Albanians. **********The Yugoslav press agency, Tanyug, said Mr. Bakali submitted his resignation during a session of the provincial party committee in Pristina, the capital. **********About 77 percent of the 1.6 million people are ethnic Albanians. **********A 70-page official report on the rioting, which began March 11 and ended April 3, leaving nine dead and 200 injured, charged that ''a hostile group'' was plotting to induce Kosovo to break away from Yugoslavia and merge with neighboring Albania. **********Ali Sukrija, a member of the Kosovo party's 19-member Presidium, told the session that ''hostile activity,'' such as distributing leaflets and attempts to stage new demonstrations, was still under way. **********He said that security organs had uncovered ''domestic enemies'' who were linked with emigre Albanian groups, supported by ''various foreign intelligence services.'' **********''Their aim is the overthrowing of Socialist Yugoslavia, secession of Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia where Albanians live and their attachment to Albania,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/14/business/us-calls-steel-exports-by-five-nations-unfair.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1981-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 487, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. CALLS STEEL EXPORTS BY FIVE NATIONS 'UNFAIR'", "print_headline": "U.S. CALLS STEEL EXPORTS BY FIVE NATIONS 'UNFAIR'", "body_text": " **********The Commerce Department today accused France, Belgium, South Africa, Rumania and Brazil of ''unfair competition'' in selling steel in the United States and filed complaints that could lead to sharply higher tariffs on steel imported from those countries. **********The accusation was the opening shot of what could be a major new trade conflict.

It soared 338 percent in price. The fund's other leading performers, climbing anywhere from 216 percent to 181 percent, were Tandy Corporation, Cray Research, Quotron Systems and Avantek Inc. **********None pays a cash dividend.  The worst performer for New Horizons in 1980 was Four-Phase Systems, a maker of distributed data processing systems, whose stock sank 43 percent in response to a sharp decline in profits. In January, three of the four biggest percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange were Advanced Micro-Devices, Spectra Physics and Cray Research, with losses ranging between 31 percent and 26 percent. **********None of them pays a cash dividend, either. (The fourth big loser on the Big Board in January was the GCA Corporation, which pays only a token cash dividend.) **********Whatever happened to the orthodox market theory that earnings, and the dividends that derive from them, are basic determinants for investing? And who are these companies - not the staggering Chryslers forced into cutting dividends, but those preferring not to reward shareholders with quarterly distributions of cash? **********As a rule, the companies are young and small, and are involved in some form of high technology or energy, the two hottest sectors of the market in the last several years. What they offer investors is the chance - although not always the reality -of huge capital gains, in terms of both higher stock prices and, often, stock dividends. **********''We don't go looking for nondividend-paying companies at New Horizons,'' explains Carter O. Hoffman, chairman of the investment policy committee that advises the Rowe Price funds. ''But in most cases, these companies are growing so fast that they need to retain 100 percent of their earnings. In the early stage of such a company's life cycle, it's best to plow back profits.'' **********The concept, then, is to sacrifice the regular quarterly cash payment on the altar of more, and higher-priced stock.  ''A stock that pays stock dividends and no cash dividends usually denotes a faster-growing company,'' said Peter Schaeffer, a broker with Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc. **********''I tell people to forget about yield if they are looking for capital appreciation,'' added Samuel Braude, a research vice president at Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook & Weeden. ''If they're looking for yield, they should forget about growth and stick to money market funds, bonds or some other fixed-income instrument.'' **********Mr. Braude is something of a disciple for the nondividend-paying stock. He monitors a list of 30 smallish over-the-counter issues and, during 1979 and 1980, 16 of them more than doubled in price. Fourteen of them, bearing such esoteric names as Computer Consoles Inc., DigiLog Systems Inc., Kratos Inc. and the Sigmaform Corporation, have yet to declare their first cash dividend. **********The risks in these young, unproven companies are, of course, high.  Prime Computer, for example, dropped 6 7/8 last week just on word that its profits were under pressure. And if the market generally runs into an air pocket in 1981, utilities and other stocks paying hefty cash dividends may take on added allure. **********Still, nondividend-payers have become the Big Board's star performers in recent years. Shares of Hecla Mining - dividends halted in 1970, with only a small payout starting in October 1980 - soared nearly 800 percent in 1979. In 1980, Prime Computer grabbed the brass ring with a 272 percent price gain. **********''My sophisticated customers never ask me if a stock pays a cash dividend,'' says Mr. Schaeffer of Bache. ''They'd much rather have stock dividends than cash dividends.'' **********Some of the market's best performing companies, in fact, have been generous with stock splits or stock dividends without paying out a penny to shareowners. **********Teledyne, a conglomerate that has paid stock dividends annually since 1967, recently declared a 3-for-2 stock distribution.  Management consistently has held to the principle of putting money to work internally and in acquisitions, rather than doling out cash dividends. Meanwhile, between early 1975 and early 1981, the value of its stock multiplied more than 38 times. **********The Intel Corporation, a leader in the manufacture of semiconductors, microprocessors and microcomputers, also has treated its shareholders handsomely by declaring stock dividends rather than cash payments. During the 1970's, its shares rose more than 36 times in value. **********According to Vickers Associates Inc., Intel now ranks as the favorite over-the-counter holding of institutional investors.  Typically, the price of a security rises when a stock dividend or split is announced. On the other side of the coin, the price often falls after the split or dividend takes effect and some holders take profits. **********''Hot new issues,'' Wall Street's designation of sought-after stocks making their initial public offerings, generally pay no cash dividends. In time, however, they often declare stock splits. NBI Inc., which went public in December 1979, is a word-processing systems company that recently announced a 3-for-1 split. **********On the other hand, some analysts contend that when a glamour company consistently raises its cash dividend it betokens a sign of maturity. International Business Machines offers the classic example. In 1967 and 1968, the cash dividend of this kingpin of computer companies produced a yield of less than 1 percent. Currently, the stock yields better than 5 percent. But its dynamic phase of price appreciation occurred when the cash dividend return was minimal. **********Meanwhile, Uncle Sam has contributed to the appeal of nondividendpaying stocks by cutting the capital gains tax payable on large profits on the high-flying stocks. ''The 1978 tax cut bill made profits easier to take,'' states Standard & Poor's. ''The top capital gains rate is now 28 percent; it had been 49.125 percent.'' **********And, notes Mr. Hoffman of Rowe Price, ''there is some hope that the top rate may be reduced to 20 or 21 percent.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/24/world/2-leaders-of-spanish-revolt-jaime-milans-del-bosch.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 268, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jaime Milans del Bosch", "print_headline": "2 LEADERS OF SPANISH REVOLT; Jaime Milans del Bosch", "body_text": " **********Lieut.

King is Revered by the People **********While the King has little constitutional power, he is revered by the Thai people and his approval is necessary for a Prime Minister.  His approval of General Prem was generally considered clear from his presence with the Prime Minister, and the rebel leader sought unsuccessfully yesterday to gain an audience to plead his case. **********Reports from Nakhon Ratchasima said the two sides began trying to negotiate a settlement soon thereafter to avoid any use of force, but General Sant, the leader of the Revolutionary Council that announced a takeover of power Wednesday morning, was said to have refused to yield. One of the apparent reasons for his revolt was that General Prem had blocked him from being promoted to army commander. **********About 5:30 A.M., General Prem ordered his troops to begin moving.  Some were reportedly flown to Bangkok's civilian airport, which was controlled by loyal air force officers from the adjoining military airfield. King's Bodyguard Moves In **********Meanwhile, the 21st Infantry, known as the King's Bodyguard, moved in from its base 50 miles to the south, and military units that had been in the capital throughout the uprising but had taken no active part were ordered to help. **********Key installations were quickly occupied. A delay of more than an hour, however, developed at army headquarters, where 300 rebel soldiers refused to give up.

Most economists foresee continuing low levels of growth and even those work experts who hold more optimistic views call for no major gains in employment or reductions in unemployment. Typical of them is Robert Eisner, a professor of economics at Northwestern University, who said, ''Employment will hold fairly steady, and unem-ployment wil l increase somewhat,'' but it is ''very hard to predict.'' He is among those who believe the automobile industry, co nstruction and housing will continue to be hurt in 1982, in large pa rt because of high interest rates. **********On the other hand, Ronald Utt, associate chief economist with the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, said he is ''still optimistic about 1982.'' He said his organization had expected a recovery to be in its early stages, following passage of the President's economic programs. Mr. Utt predicted that ''once fears and skittishness and caution that characterize the financial markets'' ended, interest rates would drop significantly and recovery would begin. The rates improvement could begin before the end of the year, he said. Still, Mr. Utt sees employment in 1982 only holding steady, not advancing, and said he saw no indications that unemployment would come down in 1982. **********A more bearish point is represented by David A. Smith, an economist at the National Center on Economic Alternatives in Washington, who said: ''There can be little question that in the short run unemployment will continue to go up. Capital investment is down and an enormous credit crunch is likely to continue, at least through the second quarter of next year.'' He would be ''very surprised,'' h esaid, ''if, b y the middle of next spring, we do not have unemploymentrates of clos e to 10 percent.'' **********The United States labor force currently stands at about 106.7 million, with 98.9 million Americans listed as employed and 7.8 million, 7.2 percent, counted as unemployed. Unemployment is expected to run greater than 7 percent, perhaps more, throughout 1982.  According to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, this is the highest rate, except for the 1975-76 recession, since the Great Depression. **********The job picture is spotty. For years cities like Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Rochester, Minn.; Wichita Falls, Tex.; Austin, Tex.; Lincoln, Neb.; Stamford, Conn.; Minneapolis, Gainesville, Fla.; Richmond, Va., and Lexington, Ky., have enjoyed unemployment rates of less than 5 percent, some close to 3 percent. Other communities, however, losing jobs and not attracting new development, have in recent years suffered rates between 10 and 15 percent. These include Buffalo, N.Y.; Anderson and Muncie in Indiana; Lewiston, Me.; Kankakee, Ill.; Johnstown and Altoona, in Pennsylvania, and Detroit, Muskegon, Battle Creek, Saginaw and Flint, all Michigan. Philadelphia, typical of old, large manufacturing cities lost 140,000 jobs in the 1970's. Some coal-producing areas in western Kentucky and the lower Middle West traditionally have unemployment rates higher than 20 percent. And in some center areas of old cities in the Northeast and Middle West, rates can approach 50 percent. **********Longstanding public-service jobs are being curtailed. A full 300,000 jobs under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act have been eliminated, and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. predicts that budget and tax programs already approved will cost the economy a million jobs.  In addition, the Administration is proposing even more budget cuts that, at least in the immediate future, seem likely to cost more jobs. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. says that under the most optimistic Reagan Administration forecasts, unemployment will not return to the 1979 level of 5.8 percent until 1985. **********The Administration, however, contends that its economic programs will, in the long run, add jobs, as many as 13 million more by 1986.  Mr. Reagan maintains this would be three million more than would have been added under policies of his predecessor, Jimmy Carter. **********Meanwhile, curious trends are operating in the nation's work force, and analysts are often unable to say what they will mean. Old industries - automobiles, steel, rubber, coal - are experiencing large, apparently irreversible job losses. Employment at the McDonald Corporation, the fast-food company, with 350,000 workers, is greater than that at United States Steel, for decades a bastion of the economy, with 142,000 workers. Many of the McDonald's jobs are part-time, and are filled with teen-agers. Nevertheless, people as disparate as Lane Kirkland, A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, and Felix G.  Rohatyn, the New York financial expert, use the McDonald's-U.S. Steel figures as an example of where the nation's economy seems to be heading, with manufacturing employment, a major part of the economy for more than a century, continuing to shrink, and service employment increasing. The employment numbers point, they say, to the need for policies to spur reinvigoration of manufacturing industries. **********Thousands of jobs have been lost in the United States maritime industries, Mr. Kirkland has said. Tens of thousands of jobs have disappeared in such areas as the garment, clothing and textile industries as manufacturers look for cheaper labor rates and other reduced costs that can be achieved abroad. Significant plant closings also have occurred in the auto, auto parts and steel industries; many mining jobs have moved from the East to the West, which now turns out 35 percent of the nation's coal. **********Service employment, which has been essentially immune to recessionary pressures, will continue to grow through the next few years. But even in this sector, according to Diane N. Westcott, an economist at the U.S. L abor Department's Bure au of Labor Statistics, jobs increased in 1980 and the first half of 1981 at a considerably slower pace than in the years immediately pre vious. **********If President Reagan is able to expand the nation's military forces, and as he increases defense outlays, then the largest spur to employment in 1982 and the following years may be the defense program, according to Woodrow Ginsburg, research economist at the Center for Community Change in Washington, which specializes in employment problems of low-income people. He said this could stimulate the economy in areas around military bases and in the defense industries. Economists often argue, however, that defense spending creates fewer jobs than are generated by spending in the private sector. According to a study by the International Association of Machinists, $1 billion spent in industry for the military creates 45,000 jobs, while $1 billion spent in the civilian industry creates 59,000 jobs. The machinists' union, despite large numbers of its members who work on military projects, favors a decrease in arms spending. ''Spending money on either military industry or on military personnel increases the country's unemployment,'' the study says. **********Mr. Ginsburg said he saw no evidence that employers were rushing to take advan tage of accelerated tax write-offs passed by the Reagan Administratio n. Such actions take three or four years or more to takeeffect, he sa id, and companies so far have not been encouraged enoughby the econom y to begin vastly increased capital spending. **********Mr. Utt, the Chamber of commerce economist, explained that ''We live in a country in which, if you want to erect a factory you just don't go out and erect a factory. It used to take six months (to gain approval from localities and states). Now it could take three years.'' **********Harley Shaiken, a labor and technology specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, contends that even if the Reagan Administration policies work they could mean employment problems. ''The real question that is not being addressed,'' he said, ''is, will they create as many jobs as they destroy.'' **********If companies are spurred to expand because of revised tax policies, Mr. Shaiken believes, major efforts will center on using the most advanced technology, often based on computer systems, to improve productivity and in turn reduce work forces. Thus, Mr.  Shaiken argues, ''to the extent the policies do work, they will not be job-creating policies but productivity-increasing policies.'' **********Such a view is sometimes disputed, at least in part, by other economic experts, who say that new technology that increases productivity often results in expanded economic growth and thus, at times, increased employment. **********Joblessness is not a factor in such fields of continuing high demand as computer science, most engineering fields, robotics and other electronics specialties, tool and die-making, nursing and secretarial work. One other promising area of the job picture appears to be in part-time employment, although such work generally is at low pay. Today, nearly 25 percent of the work force are parttimers, four-fifths of them working such schedules voluntarily.  ''A lot of industries thrive on part-time work,'' said George Stamas, a work specialist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He cited as examples the fast-food and grocery industries and some sectors of manufacturing.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Reports on the job outlook in various regions of the nation begin on Page 70."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/07/business/alabama-tennessee-natural-gas-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALABAMA-TENNESSEE NATURAL GAS CO reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "ALABAMA-TENNESSEE NATURAL GAS CO reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/04/business/krugerrand-sales-down.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Krugerrand Sales Down", "print_headline": "Krugerrand Sales Down", "body_text": " **********International sales of the Krugerrand gold coin fell to 407,680 ounces in August from 1981's monthly peak of 447,080 sold in July, but were sharply above the 273,500 ounces sold in August 1980, the International Gold Corporation said today.

Mr. Reagan was presented with the new fiscal dilemma at a review process that started yesterday and continued today at a luncheon meeting of the President and his main political and economic advisers. Congress and Recession Factors **********The review was made necessary by two factors. One is stiffening Congressional resistance, even among Republicans, to further deep cuts in Government spending that Mr. Reagan still favors as the main tool for achieving his goal of a balanced budget by 1984. **********The other factor is the economy's slide into what the Administration officials call ''a mild recession'' despite assurances given Mr. Reagan by White House economists that 1981 would be a year of economic growth. **********The review raised, for the first time in Mr. Reagan's term, the possibility of a retreat on key elements of his plan to balance the budget through spending cuts and reduce taxes at the same time. A White House aide said today that Mr. Reagan himself was in a quandary about which way to turn to combat an economic squeeze that none of his advisers foresaw. **********A number of White House aides insisted today there was no anger at the forecasters for failing to predict the economic slump that appears to be driving the budget deficit beyond the $43 billion level sought by Mr. Reagan for the 1982 fiscal year. But the aides acknowledged that the Reagan Administration was at an economic crossroads. **********''The first thing you do is try to get the President to make some decisions about what he wants to do,'' an adviser said. ''Right now he wants to try to live up to what he said on Sept. 24.'' On that date, Mr. Reagan told a national television audience that he wanted $13 billion in supplementary spending cuts in 1982, in addition to the $37 billion spending reduction approved earlier in the year. To help hold the deficit down, Mr. Reagan said he would also support a modest $3 billion increase in taxes. **********But now Mr. Reagan's situation is complicated by what one fiscal policy official described as an intense dispute over the size of that tax increase between the Administration's main economic thinkers - Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan and David A. Stockman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget. **********Mr. Stockman is said to want to shrink the deficit by imposing a much larger tax increase that would produce $60 billion in new revenues in the next three years. But, White House and budget officials said, Mr. Regan believes this would be a betrayal of the President's supply-side economic theory that holds that deep tax cuts will stimulate business growth sufficiently to produce an overall increase in tax revenues. **********David R. Gergen, the senior White House spokesman, said today that the President was leaning toward Mr. Regan's view. It is in keeping with the President's Sept. 24 policy statement that spending reductions have to be the main tool in bringing about a balanced budget. **********But that is where Mr. Reagan's economic theory runs into Congressional opposition. Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the majority leader, has already informed the White House that Senate Republicans will support only about half the $13 billion in supplementary budget cuts requested on Sept. 24. Also, Senate Republicans are talking of $60 billion in tax increases over three years - an amount close to the Stockman figure - rather than the $22 billion tax increase that the White House is willing to support over the same period if it is called ''revenue enhancement'' rather than a tax rise. **********At today's White House luncheon, a participant reported, Mr.  Reagan received more bad news from Capitol Hill. Of the 13 appropriations bills now before Congress, Mr. Reagan was told, the eight largest are running above his original March budget figures and do not even take into account the additional trims he asked for on Sept. 24. Prelude to Baker Meeting **********Today's meeting included the President's first-string economic advisers - Mr. Regan, Mr. Stockman and Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. But it was a prelude, aides acknowledged, to the week's most crucial session. That will probably come on Thursday, when Senator Baker and other Republican Congressional leaders come to the White House to hear what adjustments Mr. Reagan is willing to make in his Sept. 24 proposal. **********Before that time, a White House aide said, Mr. Reagan must decide ''whether we push for the budget cuts or buy into the various tax proposals that are floating around.'' **********Mr. Gergen said today that it was possible Mr. Reagan might choose to fight for his Sept. 24 plan, even though White House advisers privately acknowledged this would mean an open break with vital Congressional allies in the President's own party. **********Senator Baker, seeking to find a compromise that would satisfy Congress and save face for the White House, today proposed creation of a trust fund to finance military spending. It would, like the highway trust fund used to construct the interstate system, earmark certain tax revenues for defense. This would ease the competition between military and social programs for a shrinking pool of tax dollars. **********''We're searching for a way to get them out of competition with each other,'' Senator Baker said, adding that he did not know how such a trust would be supplied with money. But, he added, he had abandoned his earlier proposal for a national sales tax to finance a defense trust fund. 'Take It Away With the Other' **********Mr. Gergen said today that Mr. Reagan was reluctant to approve any tax increase after having won Congressional approval to reduce income taxes by 25 percent over three years. The President's view is ''that he does@n't want to give money back with one hand and take it away with the other,'' Mr. Gergen added. **********Some Administration officials, speaking with the guarantee of anonymity, acknowledge that Mr. Reagan now appears to be a victim of the success he had in ramming that tax cut through Congress. He acted then on the basis of what one official called ''totally unrealistic'' economic forecasts. They indicated that economic growth would be such that, even with tax cuts, there would still be enough Government revenue to fund essential social and defense spending. **********Now, with revenues diminished by both the Reagan tax cut and the recession, the official concluded, Mr. Reagan must choose between spending reductions that could touch off Congressional rebellion or tax increases that violated his own philosophy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/28/business/credit-markets-analysts-see-end-of-rate-drop.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1981-09-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1007, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANALYSTS SEE END OF RATE DROP", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; ANALYSTS SEE END OF RATE DROP", "body_text": " **********The optimism over interest rates in the credit markets appears to have evaporated, with many analysts now believing that the move toward lower rates has come to an end. **********Analysts say that short-term rates, which have fallen more than two percentage points in the last month, may not dro p much further, if at all, be cause the Federal Reserve is not likely to pump money into the bank ing system at the rapid rate of the last three months. **********Long-term interest rates have increased to record levels, they add, and weak investor demand for bonds in the face of the Treasury's mounting borrowing needs points to higher yields in the future. **********''The markets are facing up to t he fact tha t the Treasury needs to raise about $70 billion of new cash over the next six months,'' said William Griggs, senior vice president at the J. Henry Schroder Bank and Trust Company. **********''With that kind of financing, high yields are a necessity,'' he said. ''The markets have to sell each issue quickly because another one will be coming next week.'' Last Week's Attitude **********Just a week ago the credit markets were in a state of near-euphoria as short-term rates were declining and some analysts were predicting that the beleaguered bond market might attract some long-dormant investors. The Treasury's huge borrowing needs were worrisome, but even the most pessimistic analysts conceded that lower short-term rates could spill over into the long-term securities of the bond market. **********The market's performance, however, was vastly different from the rosy projections. Three-month and six-month Treasury bills, for example, ended last week at rates of 14.32 percent and 14.7 percent respectively, up from 14.2 percent and 14.13 percent at last Monday's auctions. One-year bill rates also rose to 14.53 percent late Friday from 13.91 percent on Monday. **********The market for long-term bonds was even weaker than the bill market as the 13 7/8 percent Treasury issue due in 2011 ended the week at 92 1/4 to yield 15.05 percent, down about 5 1/2 points, or $50.50 per $1,000 bond for the week. Twenty-year Treasury bonds also dropped in price, with the 13 3/8 percent issue due in 2001 closing at 87 3/8 to yield 15.42 percent, compared with its Monday price of 93 10/32 and a yield of 14.4 percent. Treasury Plans Sales **********The Treasury gets started on its heavy fourth-quarter borrowing this week with the sale of $4.5 billion each of three-month and sixmonth bills today, followed by $1.75 billion of 20-year bonds on Wednesday and $5 billion of one-year bills on Thursday. These financings will raise about $3.4 billion of the estimated $34 billion of new cash the Treasury needs in the next three months. **********''With psychology still bleak and institutional investors quite willing -and outright comfortable - to sit on the sidelines,'' analysts at Merrill Lynch & Company said in its Weekly Credit Market Bulletin, ''further upward yield pressure - especially in the longterm markets - would appear highly likely.'' **********The bleak outlook for the bond markets was especially pronounced last week when the bellwether 13 7/8 percent Treasury bond dropped almost 5 1/2 points, or $50.50 per $1,000 bond. That decline was especially ominous, analysts said, because it occurred while shortterm interest rates were declining. **********Earlier this year, many salesmen and traders predicted that a drop in short-term interest rates could be the catalyst for a bond market rally. Consequently when short-term rates began declining in early September, there was speculative buying of long-term bonds as some dealers and traders anticipated a shift of investor money into the bond market. The speculative demand for bonds was also fueled by lower overnight financing costs, which fell to 13 1/2 percent and 14 percent last week from 17 percent early in the month. Analysis of Fed's Action **********That speculative buying evaporated Friday after the Federal Reserve drained reserves from the banking system by temporarily selling securities. Traders quickly interpreted the Fed's move to mean that short-term rates would not continue to decline as they did earlier in the month. Three-month Treasury bills fell from 15.61 percent on Sept. 4 to 14.11 percent early Friday. **********The Fed's move to drain reserves was particularly significant, analysts said, because it came after three months when the Fed was increasing the supply of nonborrowed reserves in the banking system at an annual rate of more than 20 percent. **********The growth in reserves is one reason why many economists expect the growth of the nation's money supply to increase in coming months, along with economic activity in general. **********A Chemical Bank economist, Richard Scott-Ram, estimates that economic growth in the fourth quarter should be strong enough to keep short-term credit demands and interest rates high ''with upward pressure before year-end.'' The economy continues to show suprising resilience, he said, and is not lapsing into a recession. Of course, other economists contend that a recession is imminent and will soon lead to lower interest rates. Gloomy Prospect Seen **********At Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, Frank Mastrapasqua, an economist, said deteriorating business conditions were spreading beyond the housing and automobile sectors and were pointing toward a general recession. ''While the budget deficit is today's domin ant issue for the fixedincome markets, recession and lower shor t-term interest rates should be tomorrow's,'' he said. **********Forecasts similar to Mr. Mastrapaszua's have been circulating all year, though so far the burden of high interest rates has not been great enough to cause a recession or a financial calamity. **********Some analysts say that the burden of high interest rates is in their longevity, not just their high level, but they acknowledge that nobody really knows how much pain high rates cause. A recession or credit crunch could still materialize, many analysts say, but probably only at interest rates higher than the current levels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/21/world/excerpts-from-comments-on-poland-and-mideast.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3484, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM COMMENTS ON POLAND AND MIDEAST", "print_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM COMMENTS ON POLAND AND MIDEAST", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from texts of television interviews yesterday with Secretary of State Alexander M.

Haig Jr. on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' and with Secretary of Defense Caspar W.  Weinberger on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' as recorded by The New York Times: **********Haig on Poland **********Q. Secretary Haig, a number of reports tell us that the Soviet Union has supplied technical assistance, advice, some supplies, all kinds of help and encouragement in the martial law imposed inside Poland. Are they not in a sense involved, are they not an involved party in the martial law in Poland? **********A. I think as the President said in his statement this week, there's no question about Soviet cooperation and support for the activities going on in Poland today. **********And just as the Polish authorities must be held be responsible for the excesses of the situation, so too must the Soviet Union.  Q. Does that mean, Mr. Secretary, that if there are any sanctions imposed against Poland, they should similarly be imposed against the country that is supporting it and pressing it on - the Soviet Union? **********A. Now, with respect to actions that will be taken in the future, either with regards to the Polish Government or the Soviet Union, I would prefer to let events speak for themselves. Significance of Events **********I think our policy thus far, and the President's policy in particular, has been one to avoid excesses and perhaps preoccupation with contemporary muscle tone, and be influenced by the historic significance of the events with which we are dealing. **********These are very important events and the situation is, in the President's words, grave. Now what is very important is that we Americans keep the historic significance of the events before us, and not the contemporary give-and-take of the situation. And that we apply all of the leverage available to us - in some respects it is limited, but it is not insignificant - to effect moderation, negotiation and, hopefully, conciliation among the peoples and the parties in Poland. **********Q. Mr. Secretary, do you think there's any hope that some of what Solidarity has achieved in Poland can be saved? And what do you think the United States and its allies can do to preserve some of the reforms made in Poland? 18 Months of Toleration **********A. Well, I think, in the first instance, we cannot accept a doomsday theory that all is lost and is inevitably lost. After all, there's been 18 months of toleration in dialectic form. And thus far, until this recent crisis, the Soviet Union and the party in Poland has accepted historic change in the normal way of doing business. **********And we must hope that those same constraints that have operated in the past will continue to influence the outcome of the situation in Poland - and do all we can to be sure that these pressures continue. **********Q. You said that the United States must apply all leverage available to us in this situation - what leverage do we really have at this time? **********A. Well, without labeling particular levers, which sometimes is self-defeating and lessens the impact when they're applied, they involve political, economic and, of course, security-related assets. **********Q. By security-related assets, you sound like you might be hinting at some kind of military leverage that we might apply against the Soviet - Solidarity Actions Cited **********A. Well, I think it's important that at a time like this that no public official describe in detail either what we will or what we will not do as events unfold. **********Q. You talked about how the Soviet Union and the Communist Party inside Poland had shown considerable accommodation to the new freedoms in Poland. That implies - perhaps I'm misunderstanding you - but it implies to me just a little bit that you feel that Solidarity overstepped itself perhaps when it called for a referendum to overthrow the Government. **********A. I think it's important that we not give too much weight to the contemporary excuse for the crackdown in Poland as being the consequence of excess exuberance or radicalism within the Solidarity movement. **********Clearly, from the outset, the Soviet Union has been insisting on a crackdown, and urging the Polish Government to crack down. Up until this point, they've been able to blunt those pressures. The Triggering Mechanism **********Now, the fact that this call for a referendum occurred very, very recently belies the fact that it was, in fact, the triggering mechanism. The plans put in place in Poland that were implemented last Saturday had been in preparation for an extended period. **********Q. Do you have some sort of a feeling what it is that the Polish Government, under Prime Minister or General Jaruzelski, wants out of all this? What kind of a Poland it wants? **********A. Well, I think his actions will determine the answer to that question, but I hope they will reflect a consciousness on the Prime Minister's part that a rejuvenation, if you will, or a reform has been under way leading towards greater liberties and that those improvements must be preserved. **********They have, after all, assured us -the Polish Government has - that that is their intention. Thus far, their actions belie the credibility of that. **********Q. So do you have any feeling how far back they may roll things?  Originally, they said they would hold to the agreements of August 1980; now you seem to imply that they're going to roll things back even further than that. Actions Under Way **********A. Well, one can only look to the actions that are under way today: repression, violence, imprisonment without due cause, termination of the right of the Polish people to travel, suppression of the free press - to the degree there ever was one, but certainly those of a more independent character. **********Q. Is this - you talked about putting it in perspective - is this another Hungary, another Czechoslovakia, another in the series that we've seen of Soviet slapdowns of movements of this kind? **********A. Well, I think it's important for the American people to recognize this is not a Hungary or Czechoslovakia, it is something far more profound in historic terms. **********We've witnessed for 18 months a loosening up of political reins of suppression in Poland. The previous incidents were more, I think, associated with economic deprivation, food shortages or repression per se. This represent a profound challenge to the Marxist-Leninist system of traditional control. A Threat to Soviet **********And for that reason, it is all the more dangerous. It does constitute a vital threat to the interests of the Soviet Union. And for all these reasons, we should not draw historic parallels in a precise sense. **********Q. Mr. Secretary, do you have any information on what has happened to the leadership of Solidarity, particularly Lech Walesa himself, that you could pass on to us? You sound like you have some kind of knowledge about the possibility that he might be surfaced or something. **********A. Well, it is our understanding, from a host of related intelligence reports, that Mr. Walesa is in confinement outside the outskirts of Warsaw, under Government control. We also have had some reports that he continues to remain the independent figure that he has proven to be thus far. **********Q. Then he's not cooperating with the military regime?  A. We've seen no signs of cooperation. We would hope that the Polish authorities would permit Mr. Walesa to bring his experience and wisdom to bear in this situation. Catholic Church Cited **********Q. The third force that's generally mentioned inside Poland is the Roman Catholic Church, Archbiship Jozef Glemp. Do you see any signs that they are in any position - are things close enough to equilibrium so that the third party could do some good here? Pushed on, of course, by the Pope who is a Pole himself. **********A. Well, this is an anguishing problem for the Pope, of course, with its great emphasis on the moral values and the humanitarian aspects of this tragedy. But the church in Poland plays an extremely important role. And thus far, I think it has been an extremely constructive role. **********In the days ahead, we would hope that their influence on the situation would continue to be one which urged conciliation and negotiation and compromise and not the total crushing of the Solidarity movement. **********Haig on Middle East **********Q. As you're well aware, Prime Minister Begin and the Israeli Government have issued, this morning, some rather strong statements.  They have canceled the so-called strategic relationship with the United States, and they're indicating they can get along without our help. I'm wondering if you have any reaction to the possibility that now Israel may go ahead and annex the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and refuse to surrender the Sinai? And if that happens, what is our response going to be? **********A. You know, Israel has been, is today and will remain a close friend of the United States. President Reagan recognizes - perhaps far more than any President in recent history - the vital importance of our obligations to the people of Israel and our guarantees to the survival of that state. Nothing has changed. **********Now, it's always the case that differences occur, even among very good friends. And this is just such a difference. The task of American diplomacy in the days ahead is to work to resolve these issues, not to exacerbate them. Cordiality and Interrelationship **********And I would hope that the rhetoric and the demeanor of both Governments would recognize the overall imperative of our continuing cordiality and interrelationship. **********I anticipate that Israel will live religiously by the obligations of the Camp David accords; will return the Sinai on schedule; will continue, as it has in recent months, to participate as an active and cooperative member of the autonomy process. **********I'm very optimistic that today's storm clouds will pass, as they have.  Q. Are you equally confident, Mr. Secretary, that the Israelis will refrain from moving against the Palestinian positions in southern Lebanons, reigniting the conflict there? **********A. Well, I think it's important that Americans recognize that Palestinian locations overlooking the northern borders of Israel have been a constant irritation over an extended period. And the recently established cease-fire or cessation of hostilities has been a welcome relief in a pattern of historic trouble and danger for Israel. I have been very conscious of great incentives in Israel to take military action and to remove that danger, from their subjective point of view. Restraint Is Urged **********But it is also important, at this time in the peace process, that restraint be exercised by Israel, by the P.L.O., by the parties in Lebanon, and by Syria. And I'm very happy that, thus far, that restraint has manifested itself. **********Q. Let me ask you what happened to make everything so smooth and soft and sweet since the day when you first heard about the Israeli announcement and said, we regret this very surprising announcement which we first read about today; it is not consistent with Resolution 242 of the U.N. which is fundamental resolution underlying the peace process. And Secretary Weinberger called it provocative and destabilizing. Now, all of a sudden, it's part of our friendship with Israel, or what? **********A. No. My remarks with respect to our historic relationship with Israel should in no way be interpreted as a whitewash of the concern and disapproval that we felt and expressed on this recent annexation action. **********On the other hand, one must keep clearly in mind that the longstanding policies of this country represent not only the vital interests of Israel, but of the United States as well. And it is our task now - having spoken, having joined in a resolution of condemnation at the United Nations, having held in suspension the recent M.O.U., or Memorandum of Understanding, on Israeli-American strategic cooperation - the time has come now for the leadership in both countries to get to work to repair the damage. Historic Precedences **********Q. Do you have any feeling at all that this happened, that this was designed to happen, at a time when the United States Government was so deeply preoccupied with Poland; that Mr. Begin pulled this out of his hospital room and thrust it on the floor of the Knesset in such a hurry while we were totally preoccupied with Poland? **********A. Well, I'm not going to label tactics or motives in this particular case. There are perhaps historic precedences. But I think it is important to recognize that the fact of the actions did constitute a threat to the peace process. Therefore we had an obligation the President felt very strongly not to create an atmosphere in which blank checks are available for the leadership in Israel; that they have mutual obligations as well. **********Weinberger on Middle East **********Q. What about the Begin statement this morning, the rather rough, quite rough attack on the United States. What did you make of that?  A. Well, we're obviously disappointed on that kind of a reaction.  We have a feeling that it is essential that there be an understanding that the unilateral pre-emptive types of actions which surprised us and surprised the world are matters which shouldn't be allowed to pass lightly, particularly when they interfere with the peacemaking process that the President is so devoted to and has made such substantial progress in achieving. And, so we're very disappointed to hear a statement of that kind this morning. **********Q. What about there's an open break - verbal break - between the U.S. and Israel. Does that - how does that affect the chances of peace in the Middle East, would you say? **********A. Well, I think that we have to differentiate between an open break with Israel and with the people of Israel. I think - I think the basic commitment - the basic alliance of the United States and Israel is a strong one, a permanent one and I think what this represents is just what the Ambassador said - a temporary, very rough period. But it is essential to have a close working relationship with Israel just as it's essential to have a close working relationship with the moderate Arab governments in the Mideast if we are to bring peace to that troubled region. And that's what the President is most anxious to do and actually we he's succeeded in doing a couple of times just last year when he was able to have Saudi Arabia persuade Syria not to take action that would have precipitated all kinds of problems. A Banana Republic **********Q. Well, Mr. Secretary, the statement from Israel said we were treating Israel like a banana republic, like a vassal state. We had no right to punish Israel. Were we trying to punish Israel? **********A. No, I don't think there's any point in trying to go into and match this kind of vitriol. I think that's - that's not going to serve any purpose whatever. What we're trying to make it clear that actions like this kind as we tried to make it clear earlier with the pre-emptive bombing of the reactor in Iraq are actions that necessarily have to carry some cost with them. They aren't actions that are conducive to the peace or securing a peace in a very volatile region. **********Q. Mr. Secretary, for 14 years now we've been allowing Resolution 242 of the U.N. to frame the peace process.Now it seems 13 years later we can't even agree on what it means. Could you say precisely what it is in Resolution 242 that has been violated by the Israeli action? The Spirit of 242 **********A. Well, I think what's been violated by in - by the Israeli action is, first of all, the spirit of 242 which calls for all of the countries in that region to live at peace with one another and to settle all differences and all disputes by negotiation and arbitration and its equivalent as opposed to unilateral action. And that, I think, is what is considered to be violated by a statement that, all of a sudden out of the blue, Israel announces that they are now assuming what amounts to full sovereignty over a region whose future was under negotiation and discussion. The Camp David peace talks was based on these two resolutions. And I think it's vital that it as well as the resolution be observed as the only real method of trying to get peace in a region that has been torn by violence and dissent for hundreds of years. **********Q. Well, if it's only the spirit of 242 that's violated, has not the Syrians not just violated the spirit but repealed it by saying over and over again since 1948 recently and emphatically in the last few days that they will never, under any circumstances, negotiate with Israel? Chart for Settling Disputes **********A. I don't think that you can say the wrong on one side condones or justifies the wrong on the other. The Resolution 242 with the backing of world opinion that it had and still has is a resolution that charts a course for settling disputes of this kind. And my own feeling is that if it's observed on both sides, it can be carried out and there can be a reasoned settlment, a reasoned arrangement by which the disputed claims are settled and then that settlement put into effect. And that's what the resolution contemplates, it's what world opinion at the time it was drawn clearly wants, it's what we want and you can get into all kinds of legalisms as to whether the precise wording is violated or not. I happen to think it is. But there are others who say it's just the spirit that's violated. **********Q. Mr. Secretary, one of the reasons given by the Administration for this particular response is that the strategic agreement required consultation - the United States before such news. In The Boston Globe this weekend, speaking of the agreement, you said its only purpose has the object of deterring aggression and resisting aggression by the Soviets from outside the region into the region.  Its sole purpose is to defend the Middle East from the Soviets. That being so, two points, are we not cutting off our nose to spite our face, second, are the Israelis obliged to consult with us within the framework of this agreement dealing with the Soviet Union to do something strictly within the region. Peace to the Region **********A. No, the Israelis are not obliged to consult with us and the agreement is as I described it. On the other hand, the making of an agreement of that kind implies a certain understanding with respect to the kinds of actions that each partner to that agreement will take with respect to the - to the interest of the others. And it was certainly apparent, I'm sure, to everyone in Mr. Begin's Government that this kind of action, which as we see it violates either the letter or the spirit or both - I think both of the U.N. resolutions, would be something that would be very harmful to our interest in trying to bring peace to the region. While there wasn't any technical requirement that they consult with us, certainly our longstanding relationship with Israel over the years would have made that a very much more desirable course to pursue. Now, Mr. Begin, I think, has said very frankly that the reason he didn't was that he knew that we would say no. Well, we have no right to say yes or no. But we were not consulted any more than we had the faintest idea that they were going to bomb the Iraqi reactor so quickly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/29/business/business-people-new-comex-structure.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1981-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 252, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW COMEX STRUCTURE", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; NEW COMEX STRUCTURE", "body_text": " **********The Commodity Exchange Inc., the largest commodity exchange in New York, yesterday adopted the two-man, salaried top executive structure that is now common on most of the nation's securities exchanges. **********However, the Comex, which trades gold, silver, copper and financial instrument futures, did something differently. **********It retained the chairmanship for a member of the exchange and called the two senior paid officers executive vice chairman and president. **********Named to the presidency was Allan J.

Herbert J. Siegel, chairman of Chris-Craft Industries, owner of nearly 23 percent of Fox stock, said, ''No one has contacted me looking to outbid Mr. Davis.'' Specifically, he said that neither the General Electric Company nor the American Express Company, widely thought to be interested in Fox, had approached him about his key block in the huge film company. **********Stock Trading Is Moderate **********After reaching a high of $62 on the New York Stock Exchange, Fox closed yesterday at $61.50, up 37 1/2 cents, in only moderate dealings. Wall Street professionals said that extremely heavy trading - which has not developed all week - would be a sign that a powerful new bidder was laying the groundwork to battle Mr. Davis for Fox. **********In a move viewed by analysts as positive, despite the tentativeness of its announcement, Fox's decision to give Mr. Davis a look at its books was well in advance of the March 3 deadline imposed on the oilman under an agreement he has with Chris-Craft. **********Under the agreement, Chris-Craft is supporting Mr. Davis's offer to pay Fox stockholders $60 a share for all of Fox's outstanding shares. In the event of a higher offer for Fox stock from a competing company, Chris-Craft would give Mr. Davis 48 hours to match the bid. **********The Chris-Craft agreement also gives Mr. Davis until April 7 to sign a definitive agreement with Fox and until June 30 to get the approval of Fox's shareholders. Board to Meet March 27 **********Fox scheduled another board meeting for March 27 to discuss the offer further, again in advance of the April 7 deadline that ChrisCraft has given to Mr. Davis to reach agreement. Fox's annual stockholder meeting is scheduled for April 23 but the company said it might delay the meeting so that the Davis offer, requiring approval of two-thirds of its shares, might be considered. **********The Davis offer does not include Fox's television properties, which would be given to stockholders through a distribution of shares in United Television Inc., a Fox subsidiary that some analysts estimate might be worth around $10 a share. **********Thus, together with the $60 a share to be paid by Mr. Davis, Fox's sale could bring investors some $800 milion.  Earlier, in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Davis had notified Fox's directors in a letter, ''I have no plans to change the manner of Fox's operations, its corporate structure, the locale of its corporate headquarters or the composition of its management.'' **********He said he would also honor current employment agreements, pay executives at least as much as they receive now and provide for ''meaningful incentive compensation'' to key employees.

It was G.M.'s first full-year loss since 1921. **********The fourth-quarter profit, equal to 21 cents a share, was a sharp turnaround for G.M. from its third-quarter loss of $567 million, experienced as the American auto industry hit the low point in a sales slump that will result in an estimated 1980 loss of $4.06 billion for the Big Three American auto makers - G.M., Ford and Chrysler. **********The Chrysler Corporation's bid for $400 million in additional Federal loan guarantees advanced yesterday as the United Automobile Workers ratified wage concessions equal to a 13 percent pay cut.  (Page D4.) **********Acceptance of Imports **********The rapid and sustained decline of the American auto industry is the result of two years when sales of domestic cars shrank as imports of the smaller, fuel-efficient cars not available from American manufacturers won wide acceptance from American car buyers. **********For 1980 the domestic car makers reported sales of only about 6.6 million cars, making it the worst sales year since 1961.

The combination of huge investment and dwindling sales has created a financial squeeze that has brought Chrysler close to bankruptcy and has created a serious financial problem for Ford. **********With the auto industry's decline, G.M., the nation's largest auto maker, was replaced in 1979 by the Exxon Corporation as the American company reporting the largest annual sales and earnings. Exxon earned $4.29 billion in 1979 compared with G.M.'s $2.89 billion. This year Exxon earned $5.66 billion. **********Despite the grim problems, General Motors sells 45.9 percent of all cars bought in the United States, and many analysts believe that within a decade its market share will exceed 60 percent, partly at the expense of Ford and Chrysler. It is the only one of the Big Three to show a profit in any 1980 quarter. **********G.M.'s fourth-quarter earnings were down sharply from the $426 million, or $1.46 a share, earned in the fourth quarter of 1979.  Sales in the 1980 fourth quarter, however, amounted to $16.2 billion, up from $16.1 billion a year earlier. **********Arvid Jouppi, an analyst with John Muir & Company in Detroit, said he had expected G.M. to do better in the quarter, earning about 30 cents a share. **********Although Mr. Jouppi was optimistic that G.M. would pull out of its decline, he and other analysts observed that the company was in its worst earnings situation since it lost $38.7 million in 1921, a recession year when G.M. was only beginning to transform itself into a modern corporation from a collection of poorly coordinated companies. Projection for Ford **********Mr. Jouppi predicted that the Ford Motor Company, the nation's second-largest auto maker, would have a loss of about $1.6 billion for 1980, including $400 million in the fourth quarter. Chrysler has estimated its losses at $1.7 billion for last year, including an estimated $200 million fourth-quarter loss. Ford is expected to announce its fourth-quarter figures next week and Chrysler later in the month. **********G.M.'s 1980 sales, at $57.7 billion worldwide, were down 13 percent from the $66.3 billion in revenues for 1979. In earnings, the auto maker's 1979 figure of $2.89 billion represented a sharp drop from $3.5 billion in 1978, its record. **********Roger B. Smith, G.M.'s new chairman, and F. James McDonald, president, said in a joint announcement that G.M. had resorted to drastic measures to conserve cash to help finance its retooling program. **********''Employment was cut; the corporation's contribution to employee's savings stock purchase programs was reduced and the merit increase program was suspended for salaried employees; and there was no bonus for 1980 for any member of G.M. management.'' **********They said that G.M. would continue its product program in which $40 billion will be invested worldwide from 1980 to 1984.

It has that opportunity now. Will it use it? If the past is any guide, the answer is probably ''no.'' **********American business had such an opportunity in the early and mid-1880's, with the advent of mass-production techniques and the modern diversified corporation. But the inability of businessmen to respond to their public responsibilities fueled the Populist and Progressivist activism of the early decades of this century and led to the first wave of Government regulation -antitrust legislation, the establishment of the Federal Trade Commission, laws governing hours and working conditions and health standards for medicines and meat. **********Business had a second opportunity during the 1920's, after earning a measure of public trust from its War Industries Board effort. Its failure then to respond to the postwar demands of labor, investors and consumers foreshadowed New Deal programs to protect these groups - legislation establishing a framework for labor-management relations, regulations governing the securities and banking industries and laws further protecting consumers from unsafe foods, drugs and cosmetics. **********A third opportunity arose in the 1950's and early 1960's when Government fiscal and monetary policies appeared to insure steady economic growth. But the failure of American business once again to seize the initiative in anticipation of a new set of emerging public concerns about the environment, health, consumer safety, equal opportunity and political corruption, set the stage for a third wave of regulation, beginning in 1965. This wave was manifested in 35 separate regulatory programs covering everything from unsafe toys and flammable fabrics to mines and chemicals. **********There are remarkable parallels among all three periods. Each successive wave was marked by a further extension of Government control over business - of the 28 independent regulatory agencies founded between 1887 and 1980, all but seven were established during one of these periods. **********Each wave was immediately preceded by dramatic accounts in the popular press of public dangers attendant upon business activity, ranging from Upton Sinclair's revelations of unsanitary conditions in the meat-packing industry at the turn of the century, to Ralph Nader's exposes on dangerous cars, drugs and food additives. **********And in each period, these dramatic events and revelations spurred middle-income citizens into political action, but for only about a decade. **********The immediate cause of the decline was an international crisis of some sort, culminating in the buildup of military armaments, economic mobilizations, or ''revitalizations,'' and the outbreak of global hostilities. Middle-income groups, whose economic survival was suddenly at stake, quickly forsook their antibusiness activities and joined in an unstable coalition with business. **********I have simplified this, of course. But I think it is fair to discern an almost predictable waxing and waning of antibusiness political activity whose momentum has been maintained in large part by the business community's own defensiveness or indifference to public concerns. **********These waves notwithstanding, public opinion toward business has been remarkably stable over time. In survey after survey, a majority of the public has continued to support Government regulation. In a recent Roper poll, 80 percent of the respondents felt that Government must insure that business clean up its air and water pollution, provide safe products and services, advertise honestly and provide safe working conditions. These results are not substantially different from those of similar polls undertaken over the last 30 years. **********This underlying public distrust of business manifests itself in a variety of ways. Even when there is not political support for increased regulation, as now, the public vents its latent distrust by bringing lawsuits and by forsaking American-made products. **********For example, approximately 15,000 asbestos cases are now pending in courts around the country, with additional suits being filed at the rate of about 200 per month. Claims against just one company, Johns-Manville, doubled last year, to 5,082 suits involving 9,300 plaintiffs. Injuries resulting from the use of Firestone 500 steelbelted radials have given rise to $214 million in personal damage awards. The list goes on: toxic shock from tampons, cancer from benzene and vinyl chloride, birth defects from endrin. **********A T the same time that more citizens are seeking legal redress, the courts are extending the limits of liability and are looking more favorably upon punitive damage awards, in which victims are not only compensated for the damages they endure but are also awarded an amount designed to punish the company for having inflicted the injury. The Minnesota Supreme Court recently affirmed a $1.8 million award - $1 million of it punitive - against a textile manufacturer for producing cotton pajamas that caught fire and badly burned a young child. **********The public also expresses its discontent with business by deserting American-made products of poor quality. Since the early 1970's, consumers have been flocking to Japanese and European producers of automobiles, calculators, cameras, machine tools, watches, tires and stereos. **********Business executives are not fortune tellers, and in many instances it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to foresee potential dangers or injuries resulting from the use of certain products. But in reviewing these cases, one is struck by the abundance of earlywarning signals. The first cases of asbestos-related injuries, for example, were reported over 50 years ago. In almost every case of unsafe autos or tires, the companies involved received accident reports long before there were many injuries. **********All too often, American businesses have taken the short-term view, placing immediate profits above potential problems that may be years away. **********The lesson is clear. American business can no longer afford to wait for the next wave of regulation. America has grown more litigious and American manufacturers have become more vulnerable to foreign competition. **********If there should be a fourth wave of regulation it is likely to be far more onerous than any before.  Predictions are hazardous, but I can already perceive targets of stricter regulations: disposal of nuclear wastes; the freedom of corporations to close or relocate their factories; wheeling and dealing with small margins in commodity futures; the proliferation of mammoth, unfriendly corporate takeovers; the growing incidence of insider trading; toxic substances in the work place, and shoddy workmanship in consumer products. **********The irony is that unless American business actively seeks to anticipate and respond to emerging public concerns in advance of the next wave, business already will have been seriously eroded by the time it breaks.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Robert B.

Changing Structure **********But now, to cope with increased competition and larger contracts, such as that with I.B.M., Digital Research must change. It is formalizing its management structure, accepting venture-capital financing, altering its pricing policies and even planning to expand into a 16,000-square-foot modern office building, with a view of the ocean, of course. **********All this business, quite frankly, is more than Mr. Kildall cares to deal with. ''Basically I am a gadget-oriented person,'' the jeansclad Mr. Kildall said. ''I like to work with dials and knobs.  I'm not a very competitive person. I'm forced into it.'' **********Pacific Grove, a picturesque town near the artists colony of Carmel and a two-hour drive from California's Silicon Valley, seems an unlikely place for a computer concern. But there, in a small cottage near Monterey Bay, Mr. Kildall invented in the early 1970's what is now Digital Research's main product, an operating system. Computer Traffic Policeman **********Acting like a traffic policeman, an operating system is a type of software that directs a personal computer's activities. For example, if a user wants access to certain information, the operating system tells the computer how to retrieve it. **********In 1975 Mr. Kildall licensed what has become the leading operating system for microcomputers. It is called CP/ M, for Control Program for Microcomputers. The operating system was selected by the Xerox Corporation for its Xerox 820 office system and by I.B.M. as an option for its personal computer, set for delivery in October. **********Despite his preference for the laboratory over the board room, Mr.  Kildall, who holds a Ph.D. in computer science, has built his company to 50 employees in six years. For the year ended Aug. 31, the privately held concern had sales of about $6 million, and Mr.  Kildall expects $10 million in revenues this fiscal year. **********''They're doing terrific; they must be smiling from ear to ear with the I.B.M. contract,'' said Ulric Weil, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company.  Optimistic About Sales **********''Within five years, I think sales will be $100 million,'' said Dorothy McEwan, Mr. Kildall's wife and high school sweetheart of 19 years ago. She has handled the financial and marketing aspects of the business since the two started Digital Research in a 10-foot-by-13-foot playroom at their first Pacific Grove home, a cottage a few blocks from the ocean. **********But the expansion has become too much for Mrs. McEwan to supervise.  ''The company grew so rapidly that we had gone from small-time to a big-time operation, and we had to have professional managers,'' she said. **********After having venture capit alists knocking at his door for three years, Mr. Ki ldall recognized earlier this year that he should let them come in.  Mr. Kildall said he did not need their money, but wanted their expertise so he would not need to ''take chances'' with business deci sions. **********Last month, giving up only a small share of ownership, he brought in four: T.A. Associates of Boston, Hambrecht & Quist of San Francisco, Venrock Associates of New York and Page Mills Partners of Palo Alto. Changed Licensing Methods **********Under their counsel, Digital Research changed the structure of its sales agreements. In the past, the concern licensed its CP/M software to microcomputer makers for a one-time fee of $50,000. The simple arrangement was a bargain for manufacturers, said David Crockett, senior vice president of Dataquest Inc., a Cupertino, Calif., market research concern. **********Since Sept. 1, Digital Research has required graduated payment based on the number of computers sold by the manufacturer. Details of the contract with I.B.M. were not available. **********The simple arrangement bought CP/M market penetration, however.  About 300 computer makers use CP/ M, which means that Mr. Kildall's operating system is driving some 250,000 microcomputers, according to Digital Research. These computers range in price from $1,000 for home systems to $30,000 for small-business systems. **********At least 300 companies supply more than 1,000 software packages based on CP/M. Apple Computer Inc., the No.1 maker of personal computers, uses its own proprietary system, but users can purchase a plug-in peripheral card to adapt their Apple computers to CP/ M, thus making more applications software, especially business packages, available to them. Competition from Bell **********CP/M's strongest competition may come from Unix, an operating system developed by Bell Laboratories for 16-bit microprocessors.  ''Unix is competition at the higher end,'' said Mr. Weil of Morgan Stanley. **********Unix will likely be used most by universities and by the Bell System, Dataquest's Mr. Crockett said, while CP/ M ''will own the rest of the world.'' **********Previously, CP/M was used in the slower, eight-bit computers. Now, Digital Research has developed CP/ M-86, ordered by I.B.M., for 16-bit machines. **********Digital Research plans to branch into programming languages for computers. Just last week it purchased for an undisclosed amount Compiler Systems Inc., a small southern California concern that develops languages. **********''The company has a lot of potential,'' the soft-spoken Mr. Kildall said. ''I want to let the potential loose.'' He also said that he expected having a larger team would allow him to spend more time where he most likes to be -at a computer terminal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/27/business/credit-card-at-bache.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 325, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Credit Card At Bache", "print_headline": "Credit Card At Bache", "body_text": " **********Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc. announced yesterday an agreement with the American Express Company to offer a cash management type of account under which clients will receive an American Express gold card. **********The investment firm said that investors would be able to draw on the assets in their cash management type of account with the American Express card, but the card will not have a separate line of credit as American Express gold cards issued by banks have. **********Jim Settel, senior vice president of Bache, said in a statement that the cash management type of account was expected to be available by early 1982 and was modeled on a service offered by Merrill Lynch & Company. **********Under the Merrill Lynch service, an investor must put up an initial balance of $20,000 for an enhanced margin account that enables investors to buy and sell securities, borrow money, write checks or charge items to a Visa debit card.

It would also slash its financial support for the new Synthetic Fuels Corporation by about a third, or $5.3 billion, according to an unpublished document drafted by the Office of Management and Budget. The proposal also envisions that the main emphasis of the development corporation be shifted and that private sponsors be required to supply 40 percent, rather than 25 percent, of the cost of plants to be built with the help of the corporation. 'In short, Government would aid demonstration of synfuels capability but not subsidize building significant capacity,' said the working paper, though to have been written by the budget director, David A. Stockman. It said the Government would thus save $9.1 billion through the 1985 fiscal year.  It would also reduce possible disruptions in the credit markets, since the Government loan guarantees would not be so large as first planned. Word of the proposals has already brought criticism from Capitol Hill and prompted expressions of dismay from other supporters of synthetic fuels projects.  McClure Opposes 'Axiang' Project James A. McClure, the Idaho Republican who heads the Senate Energy Committee, said in a conversation last night that, when he heard that synthetic fuels were to be 'axed out,' he quickly asked that the proposals be reconsidered. 'I'm trying to find out what the signal is,' he said. 'You still can't read very well' how firmly the Administration is committed to the proposals. **********As outlined in the paper by the Office of Management and Budget, however, money would be effectively withdrawn from five demonstration projects that were to have been financed by the Department of Energy: two plants in West Virginia and Kentucky to produce liquid fuels from coal; two plants in Ohio and Illinois to convert coal into high-energy gas, and one plant in Memphis, to convert coal into medium-energy gas. A sixth project would be killed by carrying out President Carter's earlier budget request to deny funds to a Tennessee Valley Authority coal gasification project.  The Administration also says it want to Final design work is under way for all these plants.  For three of them, some site preparation work has begun. **********A sixth project would be killed by carying out President Carter's earlier budget request to deny funds to a Tennessee Valley Authority coal gasification project.  The administration also says it wants to transfer all major synthetic fuels construcition projects from the Energy Department to the Government corporation, and insists that those selected by the corporation for loan or other guarantees contain a minimum of 40 percent private capital.  Industry analysts said this requirement could effectively kill some projects. **********The basic rationale is to support a limited number (five to eight) a first-of-a-kind operating plants to demonstrate technical, economic and environmental problems and cost; to rely primarily on the private sector, and to minimize the net empenditure of Federal funds, the budget office's paper states. **********One of those opposing the cuts is Robert I. Hanfling, a Washington consultant who until recently was active in developing synthetic fuels as an official at the Department of Energy. **********These are strategic, long-term projects important to the national security, Mr. Hanfling said.  Is the obfective for the corporation not to spend any money, or is the corporation to be a means to an end for the United States to reduce its dependence on imported oil, reduce inflation and keep the economy whole?  Other Points in Policy **********Sources said that the Administration's proposed energy policy also included these points: **********The issuing of special oil bonds marketed to the public to finance a sharp increase to 200,000 to 230,000 barrels a day in the rate at which oil is pumped into the nation's strateghic petroleum, reserve.  Those oil-backed securities would be sold as long-term investments to produce capital gains and might not need to pay interest. **********The cutting of funds for solar energy research by 22 percent in the current fiscal year and 60 percent next year, and eliminating the Solar Energy and Energy Conservation Bank. **********The withdrawal this year of all Federal support for alcohol fuels, which should compete in energy markets without the benefits of taxpayer subsidies. **********The Synthetic Fuels Corporation was established last summer as the catalyst in developing a synthetic fuels industry that could produce the equivalent of 500,000 barrels of oil a day by 1987 and two million barrels daily by 1992, at a total cost of $25 billion. **********The projects to be selected were to be those whose technology had been largely proved and which were ready for commercial use."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/22/world/around-the-world-chun-promises-an-amnesty-timed-to-his-inauguration.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chun Promises an Amnesty Timed to His Inauguration", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Chun Promises an Amnesty Timed to His Inauguration", "body_text": " **********President Chun Doo Hwan of South Korea has promised a large-scale amnesty in conjunction with his March 3 inauguration for a seven-year term, but it will apparently not include leading opposition figures, Seoul newspapers reported today. **********They said former President Yun Po Sun had told Mr. Chun at a meeting yesterday that he hoped the Government would free a large number of prisoners. **********In response, Mr. Chun was quoted as saying that the Government plans ''to grant a large-scale amnesty'' but that ''left-wing elements will be excluded.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/17/world/excerpts-from-radio-and-television-broadcasts-by-poland.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 839, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCASTS BY POLAND", "print_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM RADIO AND TELEVISION BROADCASTS BY POLAND", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from domestic Polish radio and television broadcasts as transcribed and translated from the Polish by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service here: **********On Censorship 9:10 P.M.

Wednesday **********(1 P.M. Wednesday, E.S.T.) Forces hostile to the socialist state, taking advantage of society's disorientation and the psychological shock caused by the introduction of a state of martial law, are trying to proclaim that this means the shattering of the road of democratization and renewal. In view of this, the Military Council of National Salvation makes the following declaration: The Council's aim is not to restore the methods of ruling and the forms of social life of before August 1980. This was clearly formulated in the speech by the chairman of the Council, Army Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, on 13 December and in the military proclamation of the Military Council of National Salvation. There cannot and will not be any departure from that principle. There is no turning back from the fundamental premises of the process of democratization initiated last year. **********Discredited, incompetent, corrupt people, people who do not understand the new situation, have no right of return to the country's political state. **********The creation of the Military Council of National Salvation and the harsh limitations emerging from the state of martial law regulations were and are essential because the process of renewal was disrupted by forces hostile to socialism and the stability of the Polish state. Those forces tried to use the correct and essential process of profound democratization to weaken and overthrow the system, to carry out a coup d'etat of an antistate, counterrevolutionary character. **********An attempt to put these aims into effect would mean a fratricidal civil war. There is ample proof that in recent weeks specific measures were taken aimed in this direction. **********The Military Council of National Salvation states that, immediately after creating conditions guaranteeing order and law-abidance in the state, reforms will be started and continued with full energy, as with activities aimed at a still more profound reconstruction of structures and mechanisms of social and political life, which do not correspond to contemporary needs. **********There is no other way for Poland. This should be understood by everyone. The painful shock was essential in order to remove the threat to the state and its economy. **********The Military Council of National Salvation already in its first undertakings has shown that it is determined to act for a radical improvement of the country's life. The people responsible for taking Poland into crisis have been isolated. The purge of the apparatus of authority of people who are dishonest, incompetent or who cannot cope with the current tasks has been speeded up. A relentless struggle has been announced against manifestations of unbridled criminality and speculation. There is continuation of the activity aimed at introducing the economic reform, which particularly requires order and efficient functioning of structures. In the next few days, information will be published concerning further measures taken in this direction. **********The Military Council of National Salvation has no aims other than those it proclaimed on the day it was set up. The only supreme goal is the good of the whole nation. The council is acting, therefore, in the name of saving the basic content of socialist renewal and will do everything for that content to be brought into effect as quickly as possible. **********The Military Council of National Salvation is determined to continue the line of agreement with every social force that bases itself on the supreme interests of the socialist Polish state."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/business/winning-the-war-on-energy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1940, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WINNING THE WAR ON ENERGY", "print_headline": "WINNING THE WAR ON ENERGY", "body_text": " **********THE United States appears to be on the brink of winning the war it began in the 1970's for control of its energy destiny. The evidence is everywhere : Supplies are abundant, prices have flattened, a sharp decline in oi l imports has helped put OPEC in disarray, the crisisconceiv ed Department of Energy is scheduled to be dismantled and analysts of every stripe are busy trying to figure out why their pessimistic p rojections of the past eight years were so off. **********America, Energy Secretary James B. Edwards observed recently, has made major progress toward ''ending the siege mentality that we have all lived with since the 1973 oil crisis.'' **********To be sure, the United States has never lacked for energy resources. Its immense coal supplies alone are sufficient to fuel the world's biggest economy for hundreds of years. Yet, the country's recent ability to match its resources with its requirements, particularly with respect to petroleum, have been remarkable indeed. **********The issue now is not when will the United States run out of oil, nor how to restrict consumption. Rather concern centers on how long the current ''glut'' of oil will last - only to the mid-1980's or into the last decade of this century? **********Despite the considerable gains in energy conservation, vulnerability has not been eliminated. The economy is still very dependent on some 6 million barrels of imported oil a day. And the biggest question facing strategists is whether there will be further major supply interruptions such as arose from the 1973 Arab-Israeli war and the 1979 Iran-Iraq conflict and what to do in such an event.  These concerns were highlighted again last week with the renewed Middle East tension caused by the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt. **********This and other factors, such as the possibility that Saudi Arabia is likely to cut production if and when it wins price uniformity within OPEC, raises questions in the minds of some about the durability of today's comfortable situation. **********As to future conservation efforts, the Government's basic strategy appears to be to let energy prices continue to rise, thus inducing continued conservation. At the same time, sharp-penciled corporate strategists will continue to use less energy in their plants and factories and build them to use it more efficiently. **********For the consumer, analysts anticipate yet substantial improvement in conservation. They say that although the limits have been nearly reached in homeowners turning down their thermostats and putting on sweaters, there is still much potential for greater efficiency in furnaces, air conditioners and other home appliances, and in automobiles. **********''It is no longer a supply-limited world we're looking at,'' Donald A. Gunness, an economist for the Standard Oil Company of California, said. ''We're now looking at a demand-limited environment where oil is being pushed back into the ground, so to speak, by consumers.'' **********Such a forecast, not unlike those of some other major oil companies, would have been nearly unthinkable as recently as 1979 when prices doubled in the wake of the Iranian revolution. As recent as last year, the specter of gasoline lines loomed once again as fighting flared between Iran and Iraq, once leading producers within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. **********Rising prices, it is becoming increasingly evident, are doing a job that exhortation, production controls, appeals to patriotism and plain gloom-mongering failed to do in curbing co nsu mption. **********The reversal, in fact, is so great that at a conference last week sponsored by the Americans for Energy Independence, Philip K.  Verleger Jr. of Booz, Allen & Hamilton, a panelist, predicted that the Senate Energy Committee room in which the conference was held would be used in coming years to discuss ways to protect investments being made in alternate fuels. **********''The current oil surplus could last five, 10 years, and perhaps longer,'' Mr. Verleger said.  Economists now generally concede that they woefully underestimated the effect that the sharp price increases of the 1970's would have on the nation's demand for oil. **********In November 1974, the Federal Energy Administration's ''Project Independence'' report contained a table with five projections of total United States energy demand for 1985. They ranged from 102.9 quadrillion B.T.U.'s, or quads in energy parlance, to 124.9 quads, compared with the 72.8 quads the United States actually consumed in 1974. By 1980, the nation's usage had climbed to only 76.2 quads. **********At the time, it was assumed that there was a lock-step relationship between energy use and the gross national product, a belief that now looks pathetically naive, for the number of B.T.U.' s per dollar of G.N.P. fell last year to 51,500, from 58,300 in 1974. **********What's more, according to Roger W. Sant, president of Applied Energy Services Inc., of Arlington, Va., a new company that is going into the business of installing energy-efficient equipment for its clients, this decline in the energy-G.N.P. ratio now ''seems to be picking up, not slowing down.'' **********''Most of the doomsayers just underestimated the individual response to prices,'' Mr. Sant said. ''I would not be surprised by a further halving of the ratio over the next 20 to 30 years.'' **********WHAT helped fool economists was that after the first surge in oil prices in 1973-74, energy habits in the United States changed very little. Oil was still so cheap that after the initial shock of the Arab embargo wore off, big cars made a strong comeback and the first generation of more fuel-efficient cars was virtually unsaleable. **********Then followed nearly five years in which world oil prices, though rising nominally, actually declined slightly after adjusting for inflation. But in 1979, panic buying in the spot market allowed OPEC to raise prices far more than the disappearance of Iran as a major exporter would have otherwise caused. This time consumers got the message. **********''Prices doubled again and they really began to bite,'' William W.  Lewis, then an Assistant Secretary of Energy, noted. ''Everybody began to try to make adjustments.'' **********Only this year, however, have the effects of price-induced conservation, combined with world economic sluggishness and such legislative measures as automobile gas-mileage standards, caused an almost complete turnaround in the way many specialists are thinking about the energy future. **********Conservation, meaning a more efficient use of energy and not just doing without, is now seen to pay big dividends. Economies can grow even as they reduce energy use. The world now seems to have plenty of natural gas as well as coal and probably more oil than had previously been recognized. **********In addition, OPEC, which the Government in 1974 said might have difficulty maintaining a price of $7 a barrel, may have finally overshot the limit with current prices of $32 to $40. **********''The OPEC price is now so far out of the competitive range,'' Mr.  Sant said, that ''if I were in OPEC's shoes, I'd think I'd pretty well blown it.'' **********United States imports, for example, averaged only about 5.7 million barrels a day last month, down from 8 million in September 1979, and imports so far this year are 21 percent below 1980 levels if purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve are excluded. **********Such reductions, emulated to a lesser extent by other Western countries and Japan, has major implications. Between the third quarter of 1978, when the price of oil was around $12 a barrel, and the end of this century, world demand for OPEC oil is now estimated by Standard of California to be 137 billion barrels less than if prices had not risen. **********Much of today's brighter energy picture, however, reflects relatively stagnant business conditions and the fact that very high interest rates - not normally an accompaniment of recession - have prompted oil companies to reduce their swollen inventories, which are costly to finance. **********It is estimated that during the past six months, world oil inventories have fallen at a rate of about two million barrels a day partly in response to interest charges of $6 to $8 a year for each barrel that must be stored. This drawdown is continuing at a time whe n companies are usually rebuilding their s tocks for the winter. **********William B. Nobles Jr., deputy manager of planning for the Exxon Corporation, says that while the notion of a long-term oil glut is ''a hot topic'' in his office, he sees only a ''temporary surplus'' that is more likely to shrink than grow. **********This is despite Exxon's assumption of a real global economic growth of only 3 percent a year for the rest of the century, compared with the 5 percent growth common before 1973. **********Another cautious analyst is Hans H. Landsberg of Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank. Although he says that recent developments represent ''more than a pause'' between crises and that great potential for improved efficiency still exists, especially in transportation, there is lots to worry about. **********Little progress has been made, he notes, in getting industry to switch to coal; nuclear power is not fulfilling earlier expectations for it, and the politics of natural gas - the only fuel still under Federal price control -makes full pricing of it uncertain. **********To soften the shock of the other big threat to the nation's new energy environment, another Arab boycott, the Government is stockpiling oil. Early this month the United States put the 200 millionth bar rel of crude into its strategic reserve - an amount thatwould replace imports for about five weeks. This cushion is valuable,but analysts caution that the nation remains dependent on overseas sources for m ore than one-third of its oil and has commitments to share with al lies in a crisis. **********Analysts also point to other reasons to avoid complacency, such as big increases in the developing world's energy demand and the prospect that slow economic growth in the industrial countries will probably retard investment in increased energy efficiency. **********When the history books are written, however, it now seems likely they will describe the 1980's as a period of major adaptation, a time when oil and other cheap energy sources ceased to be regarded as social entitlements and as commodities somewhow immune from the laws of economics. **********Craufurd D. Goodwin, James B. Duke Professor of Economics at Duke University, noted in a recent Brookings Institution survey of United States energy policy since the Truman years that free-market mechanisms ''had been abandoned so completely'' that when the energy crisis struck in the early 1970's, they could not be easily revived. **********But now market-pricing of energy, begun in the Carter Administration and accelerated under President Reagan, is largely a fact of life and the American energy transition is well under way.  Further increases in efficiency may be somewhat harder to obtain, but, except perhaps in heating buildings, there remains a vast potential for improvement. **********The key, however, is to continue to allow the newly embraced price regulator to work its magic, most economists say. Mr. Nobels, the Exxon planner, told his Capitol Hill audience last week that he had already cut his own heating oil use by 50 percent, but added: ''If the price of oil goes back down I'm going to take my sweater off and put the thermostat back up.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/13/business/brenco-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRENCO INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "BRENCO INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/24/business/commodities-a-strong-comeback-for-silver.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1076, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Commodities; A Strong Comeback For Silver", "print_headline": "Commodities; A Strong Comeback For Silver", "body_text": " **********WHATEVER fundamental or technical factors may have provoked the remarkable rebound in silver prices this month, they have sent the metal soaring from a two-year low of $8.52 an ounce last July 31 to $9.60 at last Friday's spot (cash) quote in New York. **********The advance since July 31 has been particularly impressive because many of the silver bulls of past years had become disenchanted with the metal since it broke $10 late last June. Last week alone, the believers holding silver futures saw them rise 56 cents. **********Each one-cent move in silver represents $50 per contract of 5,000 ounces. On New York's Commodity Exchange, the biggest metals futures market, the minimum initial margin calls for $1,500 in cash. However, most brokers require somewhat more money. **********But among the most relieved winners in silver this month have not been those in the futures market, which has still to recover from the boom and bust in the metal in early 1980, when its price soared to a record of $50 an ounce on Jan. 21, and plunged to $10 just two months later. Rather, they are the owners of bags of silver-content coins and bars who held on. **********''Many holders of coins and bars couldn't or wouldn't sell after the 1980 crash because there were relatively few interested buyers,'' Ira Handler, trading manager at the Mocatta Metals Corporation, one of the world's largest metals houses, said in an interview last Friday. ''Refiners were swamped with all the silverware the public had unloaded during the winter of 1979-80, and it wasn't until the end of last year when the nation's handful of refiners saw daylight.'' **********Now, Mr. Handler noted, the growing demand silver has reached such proportions that the owners of bags of coins can obtain a premium that can be tax-free if they switch their holdings into bars and wafers. Silver bars are cast, while wafers are stamped out of strips of metal. Most refiners produce .999 or .9999 fine bars and lighter weight wafers. **********The bagged coins Mr. Handler spoke of are those of the 90 percent silver dimes, quarters and half dollars minted before 1964, silver dollars issued before that date and the 40-percent silver Kennedy halves minted between 1964 and 1969. **********''Many of the bagged coins have been culled for items of numismatic value and the coins are mostly worn,'' Mr. Handler said. ''But the trade's rule of thumb reckons that a 55-pound bag of 90-percent coins should contain 712 ounces of silver; the same size bag of 40-percent coins, 295 ounces, and the silver dollars, 760 ounces. All bagged coins traded have a face value, as currency, of $1,000 each.'' **********Mr. Handler, whose house does not deal with the public, said that the demand for silver by refiners that produce bars and wafers reflected in turn the strong retail market for their products recently. Whether this factor explains the sudden rebound in silver prices generally could not be determined at this time, he said. In any case, Mocatta quoted the following prices for bagged coins and their premiums per ounce over the New York spot market after last Friday's close: **********For a bag of 90-percent coins, the price was $8,829 and the premium was $2.80 over spot. A bag of the 40-percent silver-clad coins fetched $2,906 and a premium of 25 cents an ounce, and the silver dollars sold for $12,046 a bag and had a premium over cash metal of $6.25 an ounce in the market. **********Meanwhile, 100-ounce silver bars closed at $10.20 an ounce, for a premium of 60 cents, while the standard 1,000-ounce bar used in the global silver trade was quoted at $9.70, a premium of only 10 cents an ounce. As for the spot price in New York, it rose to $9.60 an ounce at Friday's close, up 57 cents on the week. The percentage rise in the spot market last week was fully reflected in the premiums. **********One major reason for the popularity of the small silver bars and wafers, which carry prices that vary according to size, fineness and the name of the refiner, was offered by Humayun Saeed, a vice president of E.F. Hutton & Company and manager of its Dubai branch in the United Arab Emirates. **********''Interest rates and inflation rates certainly govern precious metals prices worldwide,'' Mr. Saeed said. ''But in Dubai, which is the precious metals market for the Mideast and large areas of Asia and Africa, the market is often influenced by other factors as well.  A leading factor to us is how much silver is arriving from India, a very important source of the metal. This flow depends on world prices. When silver fell below $10, the flow dried up.'' **********Asked about the possible impact of resumed sales of silver from the United States Treasury, Mr. Saeed said: ''The Treasury has 139.5 million ounces left and Congress has authorized the sale of 105 million of it over the next three years. Well, these auctions should help raise the prices, just as the former sales of gold by the Treasury and International Monetary Fund raised that metal's price in past years.'' **********Why?  ''Such sales enable big buyers to acquire metal economically and easily. Suppose the Treasury auctions a million ounces of silver at a time. That, at today's prices, is $10 million, a piddling sum in the Dubai market. Where else can one buy so much silver at one time?  Even if one has to pay a premium at such sales, it is still more economical than having to make many deals. As soon as word spreads that one is buying heavily the price would become dearer and dearer.'' **********Paul Sarnoff, research director at Rudolf Wolff Commodity Brokers Inc., and a steadfast silver bull, agreed, adding: ''In the 1960's, our Government supplied the silver users with almost 2 billion ounces of metal at an average price of $1.69 an ounce. The photographic and electronics industries got a great bargain as a result. The question today in the market is where will the country get silver after the rest of the metal is sold. After all, we only produce about half the silver we use each year from mines and scrap. The rest must be imported for both industry and defense needs.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/25/world/around-the-world-55-at-uganda-mission-slain-in-continuing-civil-conflict.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; 55 at Uganda Mission Slain In Continuing Civil Conflict", "print_headline": "Around the World; 55 at Uganda Mission Slain In Continuing Civil Conflict", "body_text": " **********Ugandan soldiers killed 55 people and wounded 100 today when they attacked a mission station in the West Nile region, a Red Cross worker said. **********The worker from the International Committee of the Red Cross told reporters here by radio that the 25 workers at the Ombachi mission, most of them French, were leaving with the wounded by road today and tomorrow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/25/world/45-libya-incidents-reported-by-navy-news-conference-excerpts-page-a10.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1981-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 923, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News conference excerpts, page A10.", "print_headline": "45 LIBYA INCIDENTS REPORTED BY NAVY; News conference excerpts, page A10.", "body_text": " **********The commander of the Sixth Fleet said today that American fighters intercepted Libyan aircraft on 45 occasions during manuevers last week, but had not fired on them until two Libyan SU-22's fired at two Navy F-14's. **********The commander of the fleet, Vice Adm. William H. Rowden, also said at a news conference aboard the U.S.S. Nimitz, that the air battle Wednesday that resulted in the shooting down of the two Libyan airplanes took place slightly outside a ''designated'' area where the United States had said manuevers were taking place, but still well within international waters. The Nimitz is anchored about seven miles from here in the Bay of Naples below Mount Vesuvius. **********The United States has said the two Soviet-built SU-22 fighters were shot down by F-14 Tomcats from the Nimitz over an area of the Gulf of Sidra that is claimed by Libya but is considered by the United States to be international waters. Libya conceded yesterday that its planes fired first in the incident, but still contends that eight American jets attacked its planes, and that one American jet was shot down. **********Comdr. Henry M. Kleemann, commanding officer of the squadron that brought down the Libyan jets and pilot of the first of two F-14's to engage them, said the two SU-22's were approaching head on and he was beginning a turn when he saw one of the Libyan jets fire a missile from about 1,000 feet away. **********''I decided we had been fired upon and they were likely to do it again,'' said the pilot, who had flown in the Vietnam War. He illustrated his account of the battle with wooden models of F-14's and a chart showing the spiraling maneuvers by which he turned to attack one of the Libyan planes from the rear so that its jet exhaust would attract his Sidewinder heat-seeking missile. **********''There was no chance that I was not going to pull the trigger'' Commander Kleemann said. ''It did go through my mind that it would cause a ruckus.'' His superior officers said he had acted according to procedures laid down for American airmen under fire and had not needed prior approval of his action. **********Sixth Fleet commanders said all their aircraft had returned to the Nimitz. They were not willing, however, to pinpoint the exact position where the Libyan planes were brought down. **********Admiral Rowden, while describing the maneuvers as routine and ''low risk'' made clear that they were intended to counter Libya's eightyear-old claim to sovereignty over the Gulf of Sidra, saying the exercises were designed ''as a demonstration of our ability to employ freedom of navigation in international waters.'' News Conference on Carrier **********Reporters were taken aboard the Nimitz, a 1,092-foot-long nuclearpowered carrier, after it anchored today in the Bay of Naples. The holding of a news conference was regarded as a departure from the Sixth Fleet's normally more reticent information policy. The pilots involved in the air battle on Aug. 19 were present, along with other officers, but their superiors frequently cut short impromptu comments. **********Admiral Rowden said shipping and aircraft in the Gulf of Sidra area had been alerted on Aug. 12th and 14th that the exercises, involving missiles fired at remote-controlled drones, would take place in a ''designated area whose coordinates were published in notices to airmen and navigators.'' **********Some Libyan aircraft flying toward this area were apparently intercepted by American aircraft far closer to the Libyan coast than has hitherto been disclosed. Last week, the Defense Department said that numerous Libyan aircraft had been intercepted, but until today it had never given an exact figure. **********''About the closest we came in any instances would have been 25 miles to their coast,'' said Rear Adm. James E. Service, commander of the Sixth Fleet's battle force, who commanded last week's exercise from the Nimitz. Previous accounts of the dogfight by American officials have concentrated on the downing of the two Soviet-made planes, which, the Pentagon has said, occurred about 60 miles from the Libyan coast, and within the designated area. Outside 'Designated' Area **********Admiral Service and Admiral Rowden insisted today that all the interceptions took place over international waters and within international airspace. Asked, however, whether the two Libyan planes were brought down within the ''designated'' area of the maneuvers, Admiral Rowden replied: ''We do not think so. We think it took place slightly to the south.'' **********This would place the incident well within what the United States contends are international waters and airspace, and also within the area claimed by Libya. Only six Libyan aircraft penetrated the designated area, the Sixth Fleet commanders said, but, apart from the two SU-22's, withdrew without opening fire when intercepted. **********''Designation'' of an area in notices to mariners and airmen was, the naval officers said, only an advisory procedure. The purpose of American air patrols outside the designated area was to prevent other vessels or aircraft from straying into it. **********Admiral Rowden said Libya had radioed a protest about the maneuvers to the Nimitz on Aug. 19th after the SU-22's were shot down. The protest, he asserted, did not refer to the dogfight. **********Speaking of the reaction among the 6,000 men on the Nimitz to the air battles, the admiral said there was ''no great jubilation'' but ''an extreme degree'' of professional pride."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/25/world/around-the-world-206684.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD", "body_text": " **********The Red Brigades, who last night freed Renzo Sandrucci, an auto company executive held captive for 50 days, today released a second hostage. **********Ciro Cirillo, a local politician of the Christian Democratic Party who had been held for 90 days, was left early this morning in an abandoned house in Naples."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/27/business/moody-s-lowers-woolworth-rating.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Moody's Lowers Woolworth Rating", "print_headline": "Moody's Lowers Woolworth Rating", "body_text": " **********Moody's Investors Service Inc., a major bond rating service, said it had lowered its rating on the F.W.

Ross Brown, division manager, financial and market planning of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********And it is not only a proven medium, as he said, it's also booming.  Edward Hancharik, director of directory marketing, noted that the Bell System Yellow Pages, which had $678 million in revenues in 1970, went over $1 billion in 1975 and by last year had more than doubled to $2.1 billion. **********The idea of the color is to allow both national and local advertisers to give their regular listings more impact. Every business gets one free listing in the Yellow Pages and in the regular white pages, so the A.T.& T. crowd must come up with clever ideas to induce more spending. **********Possible ideas suggested by Mr. Brown were a two-page spread from Budget Rent A Car - a map of the area showing Budget locations, or local auditoriums or stadiums that would use the pages to print seating diagrams. **********To help with the latest effort, A.T.& T., after considering 10 companies, has signed up with Media Networks Inc., a subsidiary of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, to sell and to print the color advertising. **********That, of course, is right up Media Network's alley. For the last 13 years it has been doing the same thing for some of the nation's top magazine publishers - bringing together groups of four advertisers interested in advertising in the same market in the same select group of magazines; printing up ''signatures,'' and delivering them to the various magazines' printing plants. **********''The goal of color is to make Yellow Pages work better,'' said Peter O. Price, president of Media Network, which had revenues of $50 million in 1980. It has a sales force of 125 working from 30 offices. **********The color ads in phone directories, which will all be published together and will not carry individual advertiser's listings, will probably use cross-references pointing the users to the listings and the listings to the color ads. **********Since the directories are reprinted annually, ads will have to be created to last a year. The advertising rates will be based on a $20 cost per thousand and paying by the month - traditional for Yellow Pages - will be acceptable. **********A.T.& T. is starting with five markets this year and hopes to be in 40 or 50 by 1983. Denver will be first with its directory due out in October, followed by Atlanta in December, Chicago and Boston in January, and Manhattan - the core of the Big Apple - next March.  Total circulation will be about 5.7 million. **********The huge communications company began testing the concept two and a half years ago by going to ad agencies and asking them for four-color ads to be run for free. Some 24 pages were run in 7,500 copies of the Yellow Pages in Queens and Syracuse. Flags on the covers said, ''See color page section.'' **********Three months after distribution, W.R. Simmons, the research company, checked around and found that, among those consumers who got the color ads, some 17 percent could remember the advertisers without prompting and 35 percent said they had read the color pages within the last three months. **********Tests in 10 other markets came up with similar results.  The advantage to advertisers is that people who turn to them generally have made up their minds to buy. A.T.& T. distributed 165 million directories last year (both Yellow Pages and white), which probably account for 80 percent of those in the country, since the Bell System operates 80 percent of the telephones. Of Bell's approximately 2,500 directories, only 40 are all Yellow Pages.

The sucrose from cane and beets is indistinguishable. The sweetener that is produced from corn is fructose and is referred to in the trade as H.F.C.S. -high fructose corn sweetener. This fructose comes in varying strengths. Currently, 55 percent fructose is popular, gradually replacing the ''first generation'' 42 percent strength.  The remainder is dextrose. **********Because the high fructose corn sweetener comes in liquid form, it is eminently suited for use by soft drink makers, the leading consumer of all sweeteners in the nation, and by the canning, baking and other sectors of the food industry. **********Indeed, a special report on the sweetener industry by Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis noted that the goal of the corn processors was to raise their share of the domestic sweetener market to nearly 4 million tons, or 50 percent, of the total market in 1985 from roughly 2.7 million tons, or 30 percent, currently. Many in the trade hold that the impending higher sugar subsidies could bring this goal much nearer. **********What is expected to happen in Washington this Wednesday, Mr.  Barakat of Smith Barney said, is that the House of Representatives, which rejected a bill to raise the subsidy floor under domestic sugar prices to 19.6 cents a pound from 15 cents, will consider a Senate measure that set a subsidy floor of 18 cents. It is widely expected in the sugar trade that the final version will be a minimum price of 16.5 cents a pound. **********Initially, the White House was opposed to raising the sugar subsidy, despite the pleas of sugar producers that their costs were soaring and that they faced economic ruin. The Administration feared higher sugar prices would raise food prices generally and retard its battle against inflation. But President Reagan turned neutral in an effort to win the votes of Democratic members of Congress from sugar-producing states for his tax and budget bills last summer. **********''Assuming it is 16.5 cents,'' Mr. Barakat said, ''we then added 2.5 cents a pound for interest and storage-transport costs, and we get a basic market value of 19 cents. Add the refining costs, which vary from plant to plant, and we can expect a base price of between 21 and 25 cents a pound at the refiner's gate.'' **********By comparison, corn processors can produce 55 percent fructose at a cost of between 12 and 15 cents a pound, because they usually recover 40 to 50 percent of the highly complex and expensive manufacturing cost by selling corn byproducts such as oil and the residue mash as livestock feed or convert it into alcohol. **********Meanwhile, it is also expected that import fees on foreign sugar - 2.81 cents a pound - and duties - .0615 cent a pound - would be raised to further protect American sugar cane and beet growers. Last week, world raw (unrefined) sugar prices were quoted at about 12 cents a pound on the docks in New York. This is below the cost of production even in the poorest lands because it takes large amounts of energy to convert cane into sugar and transport it to world markets. **********''This is another mistake the domestic sugar people have made,'' Mr. Barakat said, adding: ''The poor cane-producing countries will sell as much as they can, even if it entails losses, because they desperately need hard currencies to pay for oil and other things. As for the wealthier sugar beet producing countries, notably France and West Germany, they too will unload as much as they can without regard to loss.'' **********Most farmers in Common Market countries receive high subsidies from their governments, which encourage the output of sugar beets and other farm products. In order to get rid of these burdensome surpluses, usually through exporting them, Common Market members often agree to sustain large losses, which the European Economic Community makes good with payments from its special funds. The E.E.C.'s beet sugar exports will account for about 30 percent of global sugar this year. **********''So the American sugar producers will therefore bolster their two major competitors, the foreign sugar exporters and the domestic corn sweetener industry,'' Mr. Barakat said. **********As for the fundamental global supply-demand situation, sugar market analysts expect total cane and beet output to climb by 6 mllion metric tons, to almost 93 million, in the statistical year that began last Sept. 1, from the previous season, while world consumption should rise about 3 million tons, to 92 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/24/business/massey-is-rehiring-215-in-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 738, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MASSEY IS REHIRING 215 IN U.S.", "print_headline": "MASSEY IS REHIRING 215 IN U.S.", "body_text": " **********With a survival plan coming into place and the demand for tractors apparently rising, Massey-Ferguson is recalling workers who have been laid off for months at United States and Canadian factories. **********Peter Lowry, Massey's general corporate affairs manager, said today that the first 215 of the 600 production workers at the tractor factory in Des Moines, closed since last Aug. 1, would return to their jobs on Feb. 2 to resume production of four-wheel-drive tractors, the biggest model manufactured by Massey-Ferguson. **********Mr. Lowry said that some of the 1,150 production workers at Massey's Detroit factory, where two-wheel drive tractors are manufactured, would be recalled in March.

Carroll, Campeau's executive vice president for finance, said Campeau discussed an investment in Massey but then decided not to pursue the matter. Massey is the world's largest tractor manufacturer. It ranks No. 3, after the International Harvester Company and Deere & Company, in farm equipment. **********The $720 million in debt to be refinanced is the most onerous part of Massey's total debt, analysts say, because most of it is short term at high interest rates. The servicing of this debt is expected to be a major part of the $100 million that Massey says it expects to lose in the fiscal quarter ending Jan. 31. The company lost $225.2 million in the 1980 fiscal year, ended Oct. 31, after earning $37 million in 1979. **********Massey's troubles stem from a wave of expansion that took place in the 1960's and 1970's and was financed largely with bank loans.  Though the management that took over in 1978 sold some plants and reduced worldwide employment to 42,000 from 69,000, the company was hit hard by the farm equipment slump last year that coincided with peak interest rates. **********In addition to the $280 million in forgiven interest payments and the $200 million private investment, the company's major lender, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, will convert $100 million (Canadian) of Massey's debt into the company's convertible preferred shares and also will buy $50 million of those shares. **********In addition, British lenders have agreed to guarantee an issue of $90 million of convertible preferred shares."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/27/business/children-s-place-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-26.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHILDREN'S PLACE INC reports earnings for Qtr to July 26", "print_headline": "CHILDREN'S PLACE INC reports earnings for Qtr to July 26", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/29/world/no-headline-110884.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********Around the World; U.S. Marine Is Accused Of Assault in Managua **********MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 28 (AP) - A Marine guard at the United States Embassy has been arrested by the Managua police on charges of assault and theft.

Wyllie, the ousted British chairman of Hutchison Whampoa, a major trading and industrial conglomerate based here.  ''The real wealth in this colony has been in Chinese hands. But they've always kept a low profile until just recently.'' **********Mr. Li, the 52-year-old chairman of Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd., had acquired a controlling interest in the British holding company over the previous 15 months, but officially took charge this month. Cheung Kong has a market capitalization of about $2 billion and is projecting 1980 profits of about $200 million. **********The core of Cheung Kong's activities is property development, one of the most lucrative fields in the 400-square-mile British colony where commercial rents typically are twice those of midtown Manhattan. 'A One-Man Organization' **********''It is very much a one-man organization in the sense that one man controls it,'' said George C. Magnus, executive director of Cheung Kong. ''It is kept extremely small and moves extremely fast. Because we know which way we want to go, we don't have to waste time with committees and all that.'' **********Mr. Li, a native of southern China's Chiu Chow region, seems to epitomize the newly aggressive Chinese property and shipping executives who operate out of this British enclave. **********Although one of the richest and most powerful men in Hong Kong, Mr. Li has a passion for keeping out of the public eye. He has not granted a press interview since claiming the chairmanship of Hutchison Whampoa, saying only through an aide: ''All of what I should say I already have said.'' **********Associates say that Mr. Li was sent by his family to Hong Kong in 1940 to escape the Japanese invasion of China, and that he had originally hoped to become a scholar. But by 1950, he had opened a factory producing plastic flowers, toys and household items, and, in 1958, expanded into real estate. **********The purchase of a controlling stake in Hutchison Whampoa represented a major expansion of Mr. Li's influence. The company engages in general trading, quarrying, ship repair and a variety of other fields in Britain, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Expanding on Other Fronts **********Cheung Kong is also expanding on other fronts. Mr. Li is using his considerable profits to diversify from residential and commercialproperty development into two major cement plant deals. And several other companies, including the most powerful British holding company in the colony, Jardine Matheson and Company, have reportedly been considered by Mr. Li as possible takeover targets. **********His success is partially attributable to business connections that allow him to bridge the gulf between established British companies and a China bent on acquiring modern technology and management skills. **********Mr. Li sits on the board of directors of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, which recently purchased a controlling interest in the Marine Midland Bank in New York State, and derives much of his support from the Hongkong bank. When he staged his first assault on Hutchison Whampoa in October 1979, for example, he was able to purchase a 22 percent block of the company's stock from the bank on favorable terms. **********At the same time, Mr. Li is one of a handful of Hong Kong Chinese named to the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, an agency of the Chinese Government established in July 1979 to encourage foreign investment. **********Although Mr. Li denies that he is acting as an agent for Peking, the so-called China connection is evident in many of his major deals.  Links to Chinese Government **********Together with the Kiu Kwong Investment Company, a Chinesecontrolled company, Mr. Li formed Yee Pang Realty Ltd., which plans to build several 30-story apartment blocks here as part of a $60 million redevelopment project. **********He was also instrumental in setting up what has been described as China's largest outside investment since 1949, a $200 million cement plant for Hong Kong that is to be completed in 1982. Kaiser Cement of California will own 40 percent of the new company, to be called China Cement (Hong Kong), with the remainder owned by a consortium led by Cheung Kong. The Kiu Yip Investment Corporation, another Chinesecontrolled concern, will have a 20 percent stake in the consortium. **********Business associates and competitors alike say that a dominant factor in Mr. Li's success is his own personal business acumen. Mr.  Magnus calls him ''the most amazing businessman I've ever met,'' with a thirst for hard work, a fast mind for figures and a near photographic memory. Even Mr. Wyllie, who was displaced by Mr. Li, calls the Cheung Kong chairman ''a brilliant operator and entrepreneur.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/08/business/ford-offers-rebates-on-1982-autos.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1981-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 746, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FORD OFFERS REBATES ON 1982 AUTOS", "print_headline": "FORD OFFERS REBATES ON 1982 AUTOS", "body_text": " **********With the new model year barely under way, the Ford Motor Company said today that it would offer rebates of $400 to $700 to increase sales of its small cars. **********The Ford rebate tended to mute the effect of its recently announced 4.8 percent average increase in the prices of its 1982 models, although some of the models to which the rebates apply had not been increased in price. Ford reported a 24.1 percent increase in auto sales in September over 1980. **********Ford's action, following purchase incentives offered by Chrysler and General Motors, was seen by analysts as yet another indication that sales of the just-introduced 1982 models are soft. **********Range of Prices **********Ford said it would offer rebates ranging from $400 to $700 on its subcompact Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx cars, their sporty derivatives, the EXP and LN7 and the compact Mustang and Capri. The prices for the basic versions of these models range from $5,518 to $8,308. **********The company said the program would run from Oct. 8 through Nov. 22 and would affect cars ordered or delivered during the rebate period.  Earlier, the Chrysler Corporation said that it would undersell both Ford and the General Motors Corporation on its Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon and ''K''-car models by holding 1982 prices at 1981 levels. Loan Discount Restored **********General Motors, which had announced a 5.8 percent price increase for most 1982 models, responded by restoring its loan discount program, which offers car loans at a 13.8 percent interest rate. That program is now scheduled to run through Nov. 11. The American Motors Corporation has cut the price of some of its Jeep and Renault models by 10 percent through Nov. 30. **********''There's no question it's early in the model year to do this,'' said Gordon MacKenzie, a Ford vice president. ''But the market is not as strong as we would like to see it, so we're attempting to help the people who need a new car but don't have the down payment or who can't handle the high interest rates.'' **********Auto industry analysts said the early application of rebates was an acknowledgement that consumers are resisting the higher price tags on 1982 models. Market Termed 'Abysmal' **********''It's fairly clear that the market is abysmal,'' said Harvey Heinbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. He said the Ford and G.M.  price cuts and sales incentives would pose special problems for Chrysler, the weakest of the Big Three domestic car makers. **********''They held down those p rices figuring they could pick up some market share,'' Mr. Heinbach added. ''Now tha t the others have acted,they may not pick up any share at all, but th ey'll still be stuck with the lower prices.'' **********Analysts also said the Ford and Chrysler price actions make General Motors' small cars the most expensive of the comparable domestics by several hundred dollars. ''The fact that they put the 13.8 percent back on for the 'X' and 'J' cars is a clue to the way they're reading the market,'' said David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert. ''I wouldn't be surprised to see them do rebates or a contest if their share starts to slip.'' Waiting for More Cuts **********General Motors has been the most reluctant of the auto companies to give price concessions, arguing that each rebate program conditions more prospective buyers to wait until a further concession is offered. **********In a recent interview, Howard Kehrl, G.M. vice chairman, said, ''We don't want people to think we have a continuous sale, that's not healthy.'' **********Ford's statement said that its rebates would save buyers more than would be gained by G.M.'s interest rate subsidy. It said the 13.8 percent rate on a typical ''J'' car would result in a saving of about $360 during the course of a 45-month loan. It is offering a $400 rebate on the Escort. **********However, the company said its dealers were expected to participate in the rebates, which some dealers had refused to do. The dealer participation is intended to range from $125 of a $400 rebate to $275 of a $700 rebate. **********In past rebate programs, some dealers have said they reduce the size of the discount from the list price offered to customers by the amount of their participation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/08/business/eurodollar-loan-planned-by-ibm.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Eurodollar Loan Planned by I.B.M.", "print_headline": "Eurodollar Loan Planned by I.B.M.", "body_text": " **********The International Business Machine Corporation said that its overseas subsidiary, the IBM World Trade Corporation, was trying to arrange $200 million in financing in the Eurodollar market. **********The annual interest rate for the planned seven-year issue is still under consideration, I.B.M. said, but sources said that a 12 1/2 percent coupon was being discussed. **********I.B.M. said that proceeds would be used to help finance the growth of I.B.M. in Latin America and Southeast Asia and provide fixed-rate financing for existing short-term bank loans. **********The company had been expected to borrow the funds in the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/01/world/namibia-rebels-in-angola-train-10000-chidren.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 677, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NAMIBIA REBELS IN ANGOLA TRAIN 10,000 CHIDREN", "print_headline": "NAMIBIA REBELS IN ANGOLA TRAIN 10,000 CHIDREN", "body_text": " **********At a bend in the road, 40 boys and girls in blue shorts and red-peaked caps stand solemnly, holding handlettered placards in English reading, ''Reagan is a racist war monger but victory is certain,'' and ''Swapo condemns USA collaboration with South Africa and its puppets.'' **********On a signal from a tall girl with a drum, the group sings songs praising the guerrilla fighters of the South-West Africa People's Organization, or Swapo, promising quick and certain freedom for South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. **********This is the rehearsed introduction for visitors to a camp for 10,000 children on a former coffee plantation 200 miles southeast of Luanda, Angola's capital.

Mobil said today that ''we intend to pursue vigorously'' the substantive issues in that lawsuit, which were unaffected by the Supreme Court's action. **********The entitlement program was instituted in 1974 to give all refiners equal access to lower-cost, price-controlled crude oil. While price controls were in effect, there was more demand for controlled oil than could be met. An entitlement was, in effect, a license to refine price-controlled crude oil, with one entitlement needed for every barrel refined. Depended on Monthly Reports **********Refiners that, during a given month, used proportionately more price-controlled oil than the national average had to purchase entitlements from refiners who had used more expensive oil. The program depended for accuracy on monthly reports provided by the refiners to the Energy Department and Mobil has charged that lax management permitted some refiners to understate their use of pricecontrolled oil to the detriment of other refiners, such as Mobil, that filed accurate reports. **********At the same time that it lifted the stay today, the Court declined to hear Mobil's legal challenge to a ruling by the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals, a special Federal court with jurisdiction over energy price controls. That court, in August, had refused to block the final entitlements list. The case was Mobil Oil v. Department of Energy, No. 81-499. **********Other Court action today included the following: Union Liability **********The Court agreed to decide whether a union that fails to process a grievance for a member who has been wrongfully discharged by an employer can be required to compensate the member for a portion of the wages lost. The Federal appeals courts are split over whether the employer in such a situation bears the sole liability for back pay, or whether a portion of the liability can be passed to the union when it is shown that intervention by the union would have averted some of the damage to the employee. **********The case, Bowen v. U.S. Postal Service, No. 81-525, is an appeal by a postal worker who was improperly dismissed in 1976. His union, the American Postal Workers Union, turned down his request for help, and a United States District Court in Virginia ordered the union to pay $30,000 of the $53,000 in back pay to which the worker was found entitled. **********However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit overturned the damages assessed against the union, a ruling that left the worker able to collect less than half the back pay to which he was entitled. Asbestos Liability **********The Court declined to involve itself, at least at this stage, in the thousands of product liability lawsuits now pending against companies that manufactured and used asbestos during the decades before that substance's disease-causing properties became known. **********Most of the companies were covered by insurance during all or part of the time that their employees were exposed to asbestosis. The legal issue the Court declined to decide today involved how the liability should be assessed between the companies and their insurers, and among the various insurance companies that provided coverage at different times. **********The United States Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Sixth Circuits, in the cases before the Supreme Court today, ruled that the ''event'' that gives rise to an insurance company's obligation to pay a claim is not the instant when the asbestos-related disease manifests itself, but rather the long period of exposure, years or decades, before any symptoms appear. The appeals courts held that all insurance companies that had provided coverage during the exposure period were liable in proportion to the number of years their policies were in force. **********Several insurance companies - the Insurance Company of North America, the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and the Aetna Casualty and Surety Company - appealed those rulings, asking the Justices to decide that insurance liability only starts with the appearance of disease.  The lead case was INA v. Forty-Eight Insulations, No.  81-198. **********Product liability is traditionally an area of state rather than Federal law, in which the Supreme Court is typically reluctant to intervene. However, so many asbestos-related lawsuits are pending in courts around the country that the Justices will have numerous opportunities to become involved. The United States Court of Appeals here recently decided a similar case, taking a somewhat different approach to the question of apportioning liability among insurance companies. **********Asbestos produces several serious respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the chest cavity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/25/business/new-york-times-march-1-1981-143-lines-p-810301-saudi-arabia-mixes-welfare-free.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Rattner", "pub_date": "1981-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New York Times March 1 1981 143 Lines P:810301; HOW SAUDI ARABIA MIXES WELFARE AND FREE ENTERPRISE; RIYADH, Saudi Arabia", "print_headline": "New York Times March 1 1981 143 Lines P:810301; HOW SAUDI ARABIA MIXES WELFARE AND FREE ENTERPRISE; RIYADH, Saudi Arabia", "body_text": " **********SAUDI ARABIA's economy is an odd hybrid, a melange of social welfare programs grafted onto a system dominated by free enterprise.  On one level, Saudi Arabia takes care of its own, But on another, the policy, which also includes severe economic discrimination against foreigners, leaves some Saudis fabulously wealthy, others moderately well-to-do and unskilled guest workers almost universally poor. **********In the sandy outskirts of this capital city, for example, high-walled compounds containing luxurious, often marble-clad villas, have sprung up. Downtown, Saudi families remain crammed into 20-year-old apartments above the city's shops. Tents and sheds dot the city's vast undeveloped blocks. **********The Saudi officials contend that their goal is to provide equality of opportunity, not equality of income or wealth. \"When you're dealing with industry, you don't have a humanitarian a spect, you have to see the merits,\" said Fouad al-Farsi, Deputy M inister of Industry. \"Since everybody qualifies, this is an o bjective policy.\" One reason for the disparities in wealth is the lack of a tax s ystem. In Saudi Arabia, there is no property tax to prevent the a ccumulation of vast estates and no income tax to slice sections off e ven enormous incomes. **********At least in part, the Saudi view of the economy stems from the Kingdom's strong religious ties. \"It is God who blesses people with luck, brains or opportunity or it is he who blinds them to it,\" said Abdullah Alireza, Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs. **********For less talented Saudis, the Government pours tens of billions of riyals into subsidy programs so that the cost of basics will be brought to a level every Saudi can afford. A pound of sugar in a supermarket costs only 40 cents but a bottle of unsubsidized Perrier can run to several dollars. Electric power is one-twentieth the cost in the United States. **********Both Saudi and Western officials here argue that the plethora of Government programs and overall national prosperity have prevented the hardship conditions that produced revolution in countries like Iran. **********\"Life is much better in Saudi Arabia than it was 10 years ago and better by far than 20 years ago,\" said one Western diplomat. \"People are grateful to the Government and there aren't at present signs of dangerous dissatisfaction.\" **********Some of these benefits, such as food and telephone subsidies, also aid foreigners. Other benefits offered to Saudis, such as an apartment in the modern 20-story towers on the outskirts of Jidda and other cities or a job in a Government agency, are completely denied to non-Saudis. **********Foreigners have also been excluded from the principal avenue by which individual Saudis have acquired wealth - ownership of real estate. A Saudi can petition the Government for land and in most cases eventually be given without payment a plot worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Foreigners are not permitted to own real estate. **********Until recently, real estate prices throughout the Kingdom were increasing at a torrid pace, providing instant windfalls for thousands of speculating Saudis. One Saudi, who pours coffee for the Interior Minister, lives in a half-million dollar house here because of real estate profits. **********said another, Abdul Sahin Saftah, a 32-year-old middle-level Government official who studied at Oklahoma State University, \"It happens like a dream. One moment your're rich. **********To build, the Saudi Real Estate Development Fund will lend up to $100,000 for 25 years without interest with a 25 percent discount for early payment. Newly married Saudis receive a $5,000 Government dowry. **********Other Government programs abound. Free, unlimited education, including generous living allowances, is available to Saudis and 21,000 of them are now studying abroad, mostly at Government expense. **********A Saudi with an industrial project can apply for an interest-free loan to the development fund, which has already lent more than 500 enterprises an average of $4 million. In addition, for enterprises in which Saudis hold a substantial interest, the Government will provide leased land at nominal rentals, an exemption from customs duties for supplies, and a 10-year tax holiday. **********For development in industries favored by the Government, such as agriculture, the subsidies are even more generous. The Government will pay the entire air freight bills for bringing in cows, for example. **********Beyond real estate, entrepreneurial Saudis have made fortunes from their own businesses, particularly where foreign competition is restricted as in Government contracts, and, thanks again to Government regulations, from acting as local agent or partner for a foreign concern. Retail businesses must be Saudi-owned. **********Mindful of the talk of corruption and extravagance in Government spending, tighten the way money is spent and shift the economy from construction, which benefits relatively few Saudis, to more basic industry. Althought national income is running about $15,000 per person, household income has been only about a third, a fraction the rulers hope to increase. **********The ranks of the successful Saudis consist of both the longstanding leading families of Jidda where wealth is still concentrated and a group of newcomers to the ranks of the affluent, more widely dispersed in the kingdom. **********\"Wealth is filtering down very nicely,\" said Abdulaziz Sulaiman, the scion of the man who was the Kingdom's first finance minister, as he sat in his elegant compound in Jidda. Mr. Sulaiman also noted that much of the poverty among Saudis is in rural areas, as a result of traditions and less developed Government services. **********For nonentrepreneurial Saudis, salaries at first glance do not seem high. A typical Government clerical worker, for example, would receive about $1,000 a month, substantially less than his American counterpart. But the absence of taxes, generous Government programs and the opportunities for private business profits change the calculations. The emphasis on hiring Saudis means that they are likely to be paid more and promoted faster than foreign counterparts. **********\"We will have to pay a qualified Saudi more because he could get a better position with the Government,\" said Nabil Issa, general manager of AV Enterprises. **********The result is a good life for even the middle class. Servants - always foreign and often diminutive, dark Yemenis - are omnipresent.  Shiny new American cars, often with the factory sticker still in the window, clog the streets. Jet travel is widely enjoyed, particularly within the Kingdom as a result of generous subsidies. A dazzling array of goods are now available in this capital city. Electronics stores, which often feature video cassette players, are everywhere.  New luxury stores, like Hermes of Paris, open daily. **********The Saudi concern about the well-being of foreigners is far less evident. Guest workers who lose their jobs or misbehave are usually deported immediately. Those from the third world are paid little and live on less, since most send money back home. The more benevolent employers provide housing; otherwise the worker must fend for himself in the tumultuous housing markets. **********Abdul Kder, for example, is a 23-year-mold native of Eritrea, the embattled slice of the Horn of Africa. He came to Saudi Arabia looking for work and today drives for a transport company. He earns $469 a month and pays $156 a month in rent for a single room. **********But says Mr. Kder, \"food is cheap.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/30/world/the-un-today-jan-30-1981-security-council.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

The Majlis is the Iranian Parliament. **********Mr. Trattner said Mr. Christopher hoped that the Parliament's action would ''enable Iran to address the important differences that remain'' over resolving the crisis. **********American officials said they expected that the Iranians would inform the Algerians soon, perhaps as early as tomorrow morning, of their final decision. **********From the questions asked by Iran in recent days, some American officials have come to the conclusion that Iran is now ready to drop many of its previous demands and to accept the American proposals, sent two weeks ago, as the best that can be achieved. **********But this is only a hope, officials said, and the history of these negotiations has not supported optimistic predictions.  If the Iranians send an unconditional acceptance message, it would set in motion procedures in this country, Algeria and Iran that could produce the release of the hostages and the transfer of several billion dollars in Iranian assets by Sunday, officials said. **********But they added that if the Iranians introduce new proposals or otherwise alter the American plan, it could delay an agreement. Originally Asked for $24 Billion **********Iran insisted last month that before the hostages could be freed it had to be paid, in cash or guarantees, $14 billion to cover its frozen assets. It also asked for guarantees of $10 billion for the return of the property of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi. **********American officials now hope that Iran agrees with the American contention that only $9.5 billion in assets was frozen and that Iran can count on receiving only $7.3 billion of that total initially. It is also hoped that Iran will agree that it can seek return of the Shah's property only through the courts. Paul O'Dwyer, a New York lawyer who represents the Iranian Government, filed a suit in Federal Court in New York yesterday against members of the family of the Shah, seeking $36 million in what the suit said were assets belonging to Iran. **********But until Iran notifies the United States of its formal position, Mr. Christopher chooses to say that ''important differences'' remain.  The United States denied as ''totally untrue'' a Teheran radio commentary that said the United States had already deposited 70 percent of Iran's assets in an Algerian bank, pending conclusion of the deal. Officials said the radio had apparently picked up a report in the Sunday issue of The New York Times that said that the United States was willing to return more than 70 percent of the frozen assets in return for the hostage release. Hostages Would Go to Germany **********The mechanics of the actual exchange call on Algeria to take possession of some $5.5 billion in frozen assets from the United States and to release it to Iran as soon as the American hostages have been delivered to American custody, tentatively set for Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. **********''I'd like to state one principle in all this, which I think is obvious,'' Mr. Trattner said. ''The principle of simultaneity is going to be very important. There is not going to be any movement, any performance by either side on the basic exchange we are talking about until each side is absolutely certain of the other's performance.'' **********The Carter Administration is hoping that all the details can be agreed to before Mr. Reagan takes office. Officials said they were confident that Mr. Reagan would carry out any obligations agreed to by the Carter Administration."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/07/business/ncc-and-simplicity-end-merger-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 305, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NCC AND SIMPLICITY END MERGER TALKS", "print_headline": "NCC AND SIMPLICITY END MERGER TALKS", "body_text": " **********NCC Energy Ltd. of London and the Simplicity Pattern Company, the nation's largest producer of sewing patterns, announced jointly yesterday that they had agreed to terminate plans for an earlier announced $85 million merger because of ''current circumstances.'' **********The two companies did not elaborate. **********However, the Bayswater Realty and Capital Corporation, a company headed by Carl C.

''We want to demonstrate that the Salvadoran conflict is not an East-West issue, despite what Washington claims. We want to show that a lot of nonsocialist countries sympathize with our cause.'' **********Opposition representatives traveled to Panama immediately after the French-Mexican declaration of support Friday and will soon visit Ecuador, Peru, Guyana and Brazil. Other representatives plan to meet with government officials in Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Algeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia. 'Protective Umbrella' **********''We hope that the Franco-Mexican statement will act as a sort of protective umbrella beneath which other countries can safely speak out,'' the opposition spokesman said. ''That's the importance of getting support from two countries that are so crucial to the United States.'' **********The opposition's immediate objective, according to its leaders, is to create international pressure on the Reagan Administration to recognize that a negotiated settlement of the Salvadoran conflict is the only alternative to more strife. To date, Washington has backed the Salvadoran military-civilian junta in its refusal to deal with the opposition and its rejection of outside mediation. **********''Unless there are negotiations, the war will go on,'' said Salvador Samayoa, a leader of one of five guerrilla groups that make up the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. ''The past few months have demonstrated that, even with enormous U.S. support, the Salvadoran armed forces have been unable to defeat us. On the contrary, we grow stronger by the day.'' **********The guerrillas withdrew to mountain strongholds after their unsuccessful ''final offensive'' in January. But they stepped up their attacks again in mid-July, concentrating on sabotaging energy supplies, railroads and bridges in a strategy that Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. described last Friday as ''straight terrorism.'' U.S. Increases Aid to Junta **********The United States, which now has 46 military advisers in El Salvador, has gradually increased its weapons shipments to the country and has thrown its weight behind the junta's plan to hold elections for a constitutional assembly there in March. **********The opposition, which includes Social Democrats and dissident Christian Democrats as well as Marxists of various tendencies, says that no free elections can take place without prior negotiations and that it would boycott elections held under the junta's plan. **********The French-Mexican declaration echoed this position, asserting that ''a new internal order'' must be established and the military ''restructured'' before ''authentically free'' elections could be held. **********According to diplomatic sources, the initiative for a joint declaration came from Mexico in mid-June, although the original idea was that it should be followed immediately by a request for a United Nations Security Council debate on El Salvador. Disagreement Over Declaration **********But, when detailed negotiations began after a visit to Mexico City early this month by Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson of France, the two Governments reportedly found themselves in disagreement over the text of the declaration, with Mexico willing to recognize ''a state of belligerancy'' in El Salvador and France holding out for some reference in the statement to elections. **********Ten days ago, Guillermo Manuel Ungo, the president of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, flew to Paris for talks with French officials in the hope of persuading them to accept language that more closely reflected the opposition's views. **********According to opposition sources, the French Government argued for several days against the formula of recognizing the opposition alliance as a ''representative political force'' on the ground that such a move might establish a dangerous precedent in international law. But, after Mr. Ungo and his team reportedly threatened to leave Paris in protest, France accepted language that had been worked out with Mexico. **********''Mexico's position was that it would accept nothing that was not also acceptable to us,'' an opposition leader said, ''and it said that we could decide what was best for us.'' **********One result of the difficult negotiations preceding the French-Mexican declaration, however, is that a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on El Salvador seems unlikely to be called, at least for several weeks. **********''There are risks in having a Council debate,'' a key opposition leader said.

A new facility will let visitors observe activity on the floor by closedcircuit television on a large screen, an Amex spokesman said.  The new trading space will contain room for four large trading posts and 140 new booths for member firms. Work is expected to begin this month and to be completed by the end of next year. **********The building plan was the result of a study by an 18-member committee appointed almost a year ago after the exchange and state officials abandoned attempts to find a home for the Amex in the new Battery Park City development. The committee had considered sites elsewhere in New York City, development of the property adjacent to the exchange and expansion within its building, which is at 86 Trinity Place. Suit Against Federal Agency **********The Amex also confirmed that it sued the Commodities Future Trading Commission Friday in Federal District Court in Manhattan in an effort to block the commission's pilot program for trading options on contracts for future delivery of certain commodities. The program, which is the first phase of a broader program to allow trading of options on the commodities themselves, is limited to seven exchanges that trade the futures contracts that will be covered by the options. **********A futures contract is an agreement to deliver or receive a certain commodity - an agricultural product, metal or even a financial instrument such as a Treasury bond - at a specific price and place at some future time. An option on a futures contract would give the purchaser the right to buy or refuse to buy a futures contract at a later date. **********The Amex, which currently trades stock opti ons, contends that the commission's program will give those exchange s involved an unfair head start in the new, potentially lucrative commodities options market. **********Amex hopes to trade gold and silver options and options on certain financial instruments such as United States Treasury bills, bonds and notes. Last Thursday, the exchange's board authorized creation of a new market for gold bullion coins. Pressure to Expand Facilities **********These new businesses, booming stock option trading and continued strong activity on the stock exchange are behind the Amex's need to expand its facilities. At one time the exchange threatened to move to New Jersey to obtain more space. That led to the unsuccessful negotiations for state aid that would have helped the exchange build a new headquarters in Battery City Park. **********This year is expected to be the third in a row in which more than one billion shares will be traded on the exchange. Stock option trading has grown from an average of 4,000 contracts a day in 1975, when it was introduced, to 126,000 contracts a day this year, an exchange spokesman said. **********The suit against the Commodities Futures Trading Commission is given little chance of success by outside analysts. But it is expected to draw attention in Congress to the Amex's concerns. Both the House and Senate agricultural committees must approve the agency's plan before it can go into effect. **********The plan limits the participating exchanges to just one option each. For example, the Commodity Exchange in New York, which currently trades both gold and silver futures, would have to select one or the other for option trading. The Exchange's Perspective **********From the Amex point of view, that is too much. ''If you look back at the history of competitive trading in futures, it has been fairly clear that the exchange that starts first develops liquidity and a dominant position,'' said Nathan Most, the executive in charge of new product development at the Amex. **********A lawyer on the commission's staff declined to comment on the lawsuit. Commodity lawyers said the key question might be whether the commission could reasonably conclude that it would be easier to oversee option trading on the futures exchanges, which it already regulates. If so, the commission's plan might be seen as a justifiable first step to a broader option trading program."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/12/business/excerpts-from-president-s-talk.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 534, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Excerpts From President's Talk", "print_headline": "Excerpts From President's Talk", "body_text": " **********Following is a partial transcription of remarks by President Reagan to a group of supporters in the East Room of the White House yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of ABC News: I came to pay tribute to you - the new superstars of American grass-roots politics. You represent a cross section of Americans from all backgrounds, different regions across this country. In fact you remind me very much of that one special-interest group that I mentioned on Inauguration Day, the one special-interest group that has been neglected and needs help - that is, we, the people. **********Now before you start feeling too good, let me warn you, you're not going to get out of here scot-free. We need your help with another vital bipartisan piece of legislation. **********We absolutely must have, across the board, a three-year, 25 percent rate reduction for every American taxpayer, and we're not going to settle for less. **********Now there are those who are insisting that we settle for less.  They demand proof in advance that what we propose will work, and they refuse to accept the record of history which clearly demonstrates that tax-rate reductions do work. I think we can prove that what they've been doing in the last few decades hasn't worked and never will. And I don't think it automatically follows that those who brought about the present economic mess are simply, by virtue of having done that, the best qualified to clean it up. The Central Question **********They never answer one question that I keep asking, and you probably heard me ask it: Why is it inflationary if the people keep their own money and spend it the way they want to, and it's not inflationary if the Government takes it and spends it the way it wants to? **********So we're asked to believe that their proposal is more compassionate to the working people. But their proposal won't even match the built-in tax increase that they themselves are responsible for. As a matter of fact, let's be honest about it, our 25 percent, across-theboard tax cut actually is not that much of a tax cut at all. It is simply removing the imposition over the next three years, by way of inflation which moves people up in brackets and built-in tax increases, of the tax increase that will be imposed on the people without that across-the-board reduction. And theirs doesn't match that. The people over the next three years will get a tax increase once this is adopted. **********Now it's that simple. Our opponents want more money from your family budget so they can spend it on the Federal budget and make it remain high. Maybe it's time that you and millions like you remind them of a few simple facts: It's your money, not theirs. You earned it, they didn't. You have every right to keep a bigger share than you've been allowed to keep for a great many years now. And when they insist we can't reduce taxes and spending and balance the budget too, one six-word answer will do: Yes we can, and yes we will."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/04/business/radice-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RADICE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "RADICE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/30/world/analysis-reagan-putting-his-stamp-us-policies-home-abroad-change-course.html": {"writer_name": "Hedrick Smith", "pub_date": "1981-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 835, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Analysis; REAGAN PUTTING HIS STAMP ON U.S. POLICIES: AT HOME AND ABROAD, A CHANGE OF COURSE", "print_headline": "News Analysis; REAGAN PUTTING HIS STAMP ON U.S. POLICIES: AT HOME AND ABROAD, A CHANGE OF COURSE", "body_text": " **********In accents as well as actions, in his denunciation of Soviet behavior around the world as well as his demands for budget austerity at home, President Reagan has begun to signal a break from the more moderate style and substance of the Carter era. **********''This Administration did not come here to be a caretaker government and just hope we would go along the same way and maybe do a little better,'' he said firmly at his first Presidential news conference. ''The time has come where there has to be a change of direction.'' **********On foreign affairs, he broke with his predecessor by charging that Soviet leaders, past and present, reserved the right ''to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat'' in their drive to promote world revolution. And on domestic matters, he declared flatly that President Carter's effort to control wages and prices had been such a failure that he was abolishing the Council on Wage and Price Stability. **********To Republicans as well as Democrats in Congress who have balked at his plan for a three-year program for cutting individual income taxes, he asserted he was not shrinking from his commitment. And to those who have warned that some social programs are so essential and sacrosanct that it is politically unwise to cut them, Mr. Reagan said ''no one is exempt'' from potential budget cuts. Some Slips of the Tongue **********Yet in spite of the toughness of his message, it was delivered in the amiable style that became Mr. Reagan's hallmark in the Presidential campaign, punctuated with occasional slips of the tongue. Mediterranean, he said at one point, when he meant Caribbean. **********And if the President sounded sharp on some issues, he was carefully restrained or vague on others. He would have to talk more with his advisers, he said, before deciding what to do about draft registration, the grain embargo against Moscow, and milk price supports. **********On Iran, he sought not to let the nation's passions over the treatment of the 52 American hostages carry the country into vengeful reprisals. ''I'm not thinking of revenge,'' he said. ''What good would revenge do? And what form would it take? I don't think revenge is worthy of us.'' **********Moreover, some actions he and his Cabinet have taken in their first nine days are less of a break with the Carter Administration's policies than an extension or an adaptation of them. **********Mr. Reagan's immediate decontrol of domestic crude oil prices is an acceleration of policies that Mr. Carter began. His freeze on hiring for the Federal Government is an extension of a Carter program. The plans of Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis to head a special interagency board to aid the beleaguered automobile industry is patterned after the panel led by former Transportation Secretary Neil E. Goldschmidt. Campaign Pledges Stand **********In other areas, Mr. Reagan insisted that he is sticking by campaign pledges to abolish the Departments of Education and Energy set up by Mr. Carter, but indicated that the move would be made more slowly and carefully than his most ardent partisans had hoped. And he sidestepped a final news conference questioner who wanted to know why some loyal conservatives were being ignored in his sub-Cabinet appointments in favor of more moderate nominees. **********On his most fundamental shift from the Carter approach, cuts in the 1981 and 1982 budgets, Mr. Reagan had only hints today. ''They probably are going to be bigger than anyone has ever attempted,'' he said. ''The clear message I received in the election campaign is that we must gain control of this inflationary monster.'' **********That kind of talk, his aides acknowledge, is intended to marshal public support for the legislative battle over his economic program.  The President intends to do more drumbeating for his program in an economic report to the nation next week and in an address to Congress planned for mid-February. **********In the meantime, he and his Cabinet spokesman have sought to project a new image in tone as well as substance. At his news conference yesterday, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.  accused the Soviet Union of contributing to international terrorism.  Earlier he had sent a sharp message to the Soviet Foreign Minister warning against Soviet intervention in Poland. **********At the Department of Education, Secretary T.H. Bell talks of cutting back loans and grants to college students. At the Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Richard S. Schweiker disagreed sharply with his predecessor by declaring that his department would not promote sex education and that he did not believe that contraceptives should be prescribed by doctors treating poor, unmarried teen-agers under Federal programs. **********As Mr. Reagan observed in another context, after the Republican victory in the elections last fall, ''We wouldn't want to go back to having just a different cast of characters with the same show going on.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/17/world/us-backs-salvadoran-junta-and-stills-coup-rumors.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Schumacher", "pub_date": "1981-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 572, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. BACKS SALVADORAN JUNTA AND STILLS COUP RUMORS", "print_headline": "U.S. BACKS SALVADORAN JUNTA AND STILLS COUP RUMORS", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration, three weeks after dismissing Robert E.

Met Ed has a $23 million state tax bill due April 15, and has said it lacks the money to pay it. **********G.P.U.'s creditors are to meet April 10 to decide whether to lend the company money to pay the taxes. An attorney for the banking consortium, Gerald Gornish, said the lenders would consider the commission's decision, but he declined to predict what effect it would have on the utility's credit. **********Analysts said, however, that the fact the increase was considerably larger than the $9 million originally recommended by the commission's staff might be a positive factor from the banks' viewpoint. First Base Rise Since 1978 **********The rate increase is the first rise in base rates the Pennsylvania commission has granted the G.P.U. units since 1978, although it has permitted the utilities to pass on higher costs for replacement power to consumers. **********For its part, G.P.U. declined to rule out bankruptcy for either the whole company or one of its three subsidiaries. In addition to its Pennsylvania units, G.P.U. also owns the Jersey Central Power and Light Company, which also relied on the Three Mile Island station for electricity. **********The company spokesman said that the company was dependent on its revolving credit agreement, and noted that even with the increases, the Pennsylvania subsidiaries would continue to operate under conditions of ''severe austerity.'' **********No operating utility in the United States has ever gone bankrupt, and several management studies commissioned by G.P.U. have indicated that bankruptcy would not solve the problem of supplying power to G.P.U.'s current customers, or of cleaning up the damaged reactor. **********The Pennsylvania commission previously ruled that the cleanup costs could not be recovered through rate increases. Since the company cannot afford to foot the bill, however, G.P.U. and nuclear industry proponents are scrambling to come up with a plan that would somehow distribute these costs among the nuclear users in general, the Federal Government and Pennsylvania taxpayers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/20/business/advertising-and-now-it-s-designer-ads.html": {"writer_name": "Sandra Salmans", "pub_date": "1981-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 182, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; And Now It's Designer Ads", "print_headline": "Advertising; And Now It's Designer Ads", "body_text": " **********See Jean Cacharel drive his Rolls-Royce through Paris.

Prices were also increased by the release of buying demand that had built up during the slow trading days of the holiday season, when many investors and speculators were absent from the marketplace. **********''There were a lot of buyers just lined up waiting for the new year,'' one Treasury securities dealer said. In the bond market, for example, 12 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due 2010 opened 1 3/4 point higher than late Friday and then rose another point to close at about 108 7/8 to yield 11.72 percent. Volatility remains a byword on the market, as shown by the bond issue, which was offered as high as 110 1/4 at one time. **********Drop in M-1B **********The sharp rise in prices and drop in yields began at the opening and gathered steam when the Federal Reserve announced a $2.8 billion decline in the basic money supply, M-1B. The decline in the money supply, which leaves the level of M-1B within the Fed's target area for 1981, encouraged traders to expect lower short-term rates soon.  As the money supply declines, banks need to hold fewer dollars on deposit at the Federal Reserve, so they borrow less in the Federal funds market. **********In the Treasury bill market, new three-and six-month issues were auctioned at rates well below the previous week. Late in the day the Treasury announced that new three-month bills averaged 13.60 percent compared with 13.91 percent last week while six-month bills averaged 13.18 compared with 13.41 percent. After adding 25 hundredths of a percentage point to the six-month bill, banks and thrift institutions may pay as much as 13.43 percent for new six-month money market savings certificates. **********Among outstanding Treasury bill issues, rates dropped as low as 13.35 percent for three months and 12.75 percent for six months before prices retreated and rates rose during the afternoon. **********According to many dealers, the buying demand for notes and bonds was mostly among securities firms that expect to earn profits when bonds bought now are sold at higher prices in the future. **********''I would not call it tremendous institutional buying,'' said Howard Blum Jr., an executive vice president at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. He added, however, that the move to lower rates has been great enough that many more corporations will now be willing to sell bonds, which in turn will attract more institutional buying. 'Risk-Averters' **********''The big investors are essentially risk averters,'' Mr. Blum said, ''so they will commit their funds to longer-term issues only gradually'' while assessing the chances that inflation and interest rates will decline for more than just a few months or calendar quarters. **********In the Treasury note sector, the 15 1/8 percent notes due in two years were offered at 104 22/32, up more than a point, to yield 12.36 percent, and the new 12 3/8 percent notes due in seven years were offered at 100 28/32 to yield 12.14 percent. **********In advance of today's Treasury auction of $1.5 billion of new 20-year, one-month bonds, dealers estimated the average yield at 11 3/4 percent to 12 percent. **********Prices also rose sharply in the tax-exempt market, dealers said.  While yields for Treasury issues decline for longer maturities, the opposite is true in the tax-exempt market. One dealer estimated that high-grade state bonds might yield around 7 percent for 1982-84 maturities, compared with 7.75 percent for bonds due in 10 years and 9 percent for bonds due in 20 years. ''Those yields are 40 and 50 basis points less than Friday,'' commented Alex Marcinkiewcz, a trader at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, who added that ''there are so few bonds around that it is hard to estimate yields.'' **********Because of the higher yields for longer maturities, Maryland announced that when it sells $149 million of bonds Feb. 4 it will ask underwriters to bid for bonds due from one through 10 years as well as one through 15 years. **********In the corporate market, underwriters led by Salomon Brothers said that American Express Credit Corporation's $100 million of Aa-rated notes due 1991 will be offered at par with a 12 7/8 percent coupon. **********Following are results of Monday's auction of new three-and sixmonth Treasury bills:"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/17/world/us-7th-army-ready-to-fight-military-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "Drew Middleton", "pub_date": "1981-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 997, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Military Analysis", "print_headline": "U.S. 7TH ARMY: READY TO FIGHT; Military Analysis", "body_text": " **********The United States Seventh Army, a basic element in NATO's defense of Western Europe, is enjoying a new confidence based on a flow of new weapons, more money for long deferred projects and a perceptible rise in motivation and discipline. **********Balancing these positive factors are serious problems over the location of important units and suppliers, obsolescence of most of the Army's wheeled vehicles and appalling conditions at most bases and their barracks. **********These conditions are so serious that a staff officer predicted that nearly half the commissioned and noncommissioned officers scheduled for assignment to the Seventh Army this summer would be ''no shows.'' This means that they will choose to retire rather than accept the shoddy billets and primitive working conditions. **********The Seventh Army is not the perfect fighting machine its leaders would like it to be. But it is a better armed, more cohesive force than its detractors allege and is superior to the turbulent, drugridden force of five years ago. New Equipment Over Next 6 Years **********These conclusions are the result of a week's visit to armored, infantry, artillery and supply units of the Seventh Army and talks with soldiers, noncommissioned officers and junior and senior officers in field and staff posts. **********One cause for confidence is that over the next six years, the Seventh Army will receive more than 300 items of new equipment. These will range from protective clothing for nuclear, biological and chemical warfare to the M-1 tank and a family of antitank and antiaircraft missiles. **********Other items, such as the improved TOW vehicle and the M-60A3 tank, are already reaching units. Others, like the Tacfire and Tacfinder team, are on the way. **********Tacfire and Tacfinder are expected to strengthen the artillery, which, officers said, is deficient in numbers of guns and surface-tosurface missiles. Tacfinder, based on radar, picks up enemy mortar and gunfire. Tacfire instantly computes the range, battery and type of round to answer the incoming fire. **********The Seventh Army's trucks and jeeps are wearing out. At one motor pool there were two two-and-a-half-ton trucks with more than 100,000 miles on their odometers. Others had gone 75,000 miles. Jeeps and trucks are afflicted with rust, and as they age the time needed for maintenance increases. 'Well-Trained Combat Army' **********Gen. Frederick C. Kroessen, the Seventh Army commander, believes that he has a ''well-trained combat army'' that can defend the borders of Western Europe but that he must rely on reinforcement and resupply because there is ''no capacity in the European theater to sustain a battle.'' **********Officers and enlisted men believe that the existing deficiencies in some weapons will be met by a Defense Department acutely aware of the Seventh Army's needs. They are less sure that the Army will be repositioned to more tactically realistic sites and that working and living conditions will be improved. **********The most striking instance of the need for repositioning is the location of the Eighth Infantry Division of V Corps.  The Eighth is is the largest division in the Army, with 4 brigades, more than 21,000 soldiers, 490 tanks and nearly 900 armored personnel carriers. A 'Worrisome' Situation **********But the bulk of this division is stationed west of the Rhine River, in areas around Wiesbaden, Mainz and Mannheim. The estimate, perhaps optimistic, is that the division's covering force would take 12 hours to reach its war station near the Fulda Gap, in eastern Hesse state, the main force would need 25 to 27 hours and the artillery would take 20 hours. **********If the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has a week's warning of a possible Soviet invasion, these times would suffice. Most intelligence specialists believe that the alliance will have that much warning, but there is no guarantee. **********The present situation, which one divisional commander called ''worrisome,'' could be improved if what the Army calls its Master Restationing Plan is carried out. **********Relocation of the division's brigades is linked to a cure for the serious morale problem arising from the working and living conditions of the troops. These conditions are bad throughout the Seventh Army and the cost of correcting them would be astronomical. 'Generally Appalling' Conditions **********One estimate is that $2 billion would be required to complete the restationing program. General Kroessen recently reported to Congress that conditions in Army base and housing areas are ''generally appalling.'' The large military complexes, he emphasized, are urban facilities that are old and obsolete. **********Members of Congress interested in military affairs respond that NATO countries, specifically West Germany, should help pay for new construction. The West German Army and Air Force are housed in modern buildings superior to those available to the Seventh Army. **********The Second Battalion of the 75th Artillery Regiment is based at Fliegerhorst, a World War II Luftwaffe base near Hanau. In most American prisons, such working and living conditions would probably lead to riots. **********The battalion has only one maintenance shed, which has just two pits for vehicle repair. Water seeps through the ceiling. The lighting is poor, the working conditions cramped. **********The barracks are even worse, although they appeared to be average for the Seventh Army. Six men occupy a room intended for four. The lighting fixtures frequently fail and, because of the need to save energy, only one light is used. In the winter the cold is so intense in most rooms that soldiers take their sleeping bags and head for the warmth of the boiler room. **********The barracks' foundations are crumbling. Water seeps into the cellar, toilets back up.

''Back then, the high financing costs discouraged speculative purchases, but now I see speculators returning to the market'' as they anticipate higher bond prices and lower long-term interest rates. **********Reasons for Reluctance **********Peter Kordell, president and an economist at the commodities firm of Kordell & Company, cited two reasons why investors were reluctant to buy bonds now. First, he said, ''they have yet to be convinced that Congress will go along with the spending cuts the President wants.'' **********Second, he said, ''there are doubts about whether the supply-side policies will work - I think the tax cuts could merely increase consumer spending without leading to the increased investment'' that is needed for economic growth without higher inflation. **********Despite his doubts, Mr. Kordell expects long-term interest rates to decline in the future, though saying that ''this is not a time to commit all your money to the bond market.'' He concluded that, ''if long-term interest rates don't come down as the President announces and implements his budget plans, then they will come down as the economy weakens.'' **********Prices of new Treasury note and bond issues declined on the day, but closed above their lowest levels. The new 13 1/4 percent notes due in September 1984 closed at 100, up from the average price of 99 22/32 set Tuesday, when the Treasury sold $3.75 billion of the new notes. The 13 percent notes due in 1990 closed at 100 11/32 to yield 12.92 percent, down from an average price of 100 1/2 at Wednesday's auction. **********After yesterday's auction, the outstanding 12 3/4 percent Treasury bonds closed at 101 1/4 to yield 12.58 percent. The 12.68 percent average yield at the auction was less than the 12.81 percent average on similar bonds sold last November. Rate Hopes Damped **********In the money markets, hopes that the Fed might be encouraging lower interest rates were damped yesterday, analysts said.

This means the ceiling will come off by Aug. 1, 1985. **********The ceiling on the 30-month certificate is now 12 percent at savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks and 11 3/4 percent at commercial banks. Beginning Aug. 1, the rate on these certificates will be pegged to the rate on 30-month Treasury securities, now about 14 1/2 percent. If the Treasury rate remained at that level, then the rate for the 30-month certificates would rise about 2 1/2 percentage points next Aug. 1. **********Timetable Described **********The new five-year timetable was described by Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, a member of the D.I.D.C., as firm but not irreversible. He noted that, if interest rates should come down more rapidly than expected, the scheduled phase-out of ceilings could be accelerated even more. **********On the other hand he said that, if ''something untoward'' should happen and it becomes apparent that some financial institutions are being hurt by the schedule, it could be modified. **********He said the committee's actions were being put into legal language and would shortly be inserted in The Federal Register.  Under the complex schedule agreed to today by the Treasury Secretary and by the chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration, ceilings on all deposits of four years' maturity or more will also be eliminated on Aug. 1. Most of these deposits now have maximum ceilings of about 12 percent. **********Ceilings on deposits of between 30 months and four years would be eliminated on a staggered schedule, with some changes being made each Aug. 1 through Aug. 1, 1985, when the last of the ceilings would be dropped on savings deposits of 30 months or more in duration. **********Irvine H. Sprague, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, proposed to double the current interest rate on passbook savings, the form of account held by most small savers. These accounts, which have no required deposit length, now have a ceiling of 5 1/4 percent at commercial banks and 5 1/2 percent at savings institutions. **********Mr. Sprague argued that the small savers had long been discriminated against and were in effect subsidizing the higher interest rates offered on larger deposits. **********But Richard T. Pratt, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, contended that such action taken now, when most thrift institutions are feeling severe earnings pressure, would be ''extremely detrimental.'' **********The Home Loan Bank Board regulates savings and loan associations.  Mr. Sprague's agency regulates mutual savings banks and some smaller commercial banks. The savings associations and savings banks are collectively known as thrifts. **********Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, whose institution regulates most of the large commercial banks, suggested that the panel should put the Sprague proposal up for ''informal comment'' and at this time should come down neither for nor against it. **********The committee, which was holding an open meeting in the Treasury's gilded Cash Room under the so-called Sunshine Law, then agreed to this compromise. **********Treasury Secretary Regan, who is chairman of the panel, proposed the accelerated phase-out of the interest rate ceilings and his proposal was accepted by all members except Mr. Pratt, who abstained. **********The savings and loan industry has been chary of deregulalting too swiftly for fear that many of its members would fail financially if forced by competitive pressures to pay higher rates on savings. Many of the thrift units are locked into long-term mortgage portfolios that earn them less than 10 percent interest annually. **********The industry's income comes mainly from interest rates on home mortgages. Yields on most of these mortgages are less than 10 percent and are lower than the cost of deposits. Mr. Pratt reported that 70 percent of the 4,700 savings and loan associations were now suffering losses. **********Other industry specialists have forecast that the industry will lose more than $5 billion this year.  Congress in the current tax bill has been examining ways to help the industry. Both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee have approved a 12-month tax-exempt savings certificate that would let single taxpayers exclude from their income up to $1,000 a year and would let married couples exclude up to $2,000 a year. The savings certificate would pay 70 percent of the interest on a 12-month Treasury bill, thus lowering the cost to the thrifts while increasing net income to many middle-income investors. **********But in earlier testimony today before a House Banking subcommittee, Mr. Volcker was highly critical of the idea. He said it was ''not a sound approach'' because it would merely ''rejigger existing savings'' and be more costly for the savings associations. **********The thrift industry has been waging an intense lobbying campaign to get the proposal carried.  Today's meeting of the regulators turned down a proposal by Mr.  Pratt of the Home Loan Bank Board to restore the quarter-percentagepoint differential for thrift institutions on another popular savings instrument, the six-month money market certificate. **********When these certificates were introduced in June 1978, the ceilings were set equal to the six-month Treasury bill rate plus a quarter of a percentage point for thrifts. **********But a later action eliminated this differential when the Treasury bill rate exceeded 9 percent, as it has in recent months.

Brezhnev's suggestion of a summit meeting, the Soviet leader's move has raised complications for the Administration's initial strategy of trying to rally support for a harder line toward Moscow. **********American experts on the Soviet Union and West European ambasadors acknowledge that Mr. Brezhnev has a long-term interest in detente, both for reasons of vital trade with the West and because of his personal commitment to the effort to improve relations. **********But specialists here also credit the aging Soviet leader with a clever gambit aimed at playing upon divisions between Washington and the West Europeans, especially Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany, for whom the maintenance of cordial relations with Moscow is a central policy objective. **********Some experienced officials suspect that the Soviet suggestions of a top-level meeting, coupled with proposals on arms control, may also play upon the fears of American liberals that the initial flurry of anti-Soviet charges from President Reagan and Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., was ill-considered and might jeopardize prospects for arms control. **********'A Very Useful Line for Brezhnev' **********''It's a very useful line for Brezhnev to play,'' commented one high Administration official. ''It fits in with the constant desire the Soviets have to split us off from the Europeans. It would have been much simpler for us if he had taken the same hard line as Ustinov.'' **********Two days before Mr. Brezhnev spoke to the Soviet Communist Party Congress, Defense Minister Dmitri F. Ustinov accused the Reagan Administration of trying to revive the cold war with its tough language and its plans to step up military spending. **********The article written by Marshal Ustinov was the kind of traditional Soviet polemic that played neatly into the hands of the Reagan Administration as a chorus of charges emanated from Washington about Soviet and Cuban involvement in arms shipments to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador. **********''Now, you've got the hard and soft pitch from Moscow,'' said one specialist on Soviet affairs. ''First Ustinov, the tough guy, and now Brezhnev, the statesman. That will encourage people like Schmidt to play the detente game.'' U.S. Pushed Into 2-Track Approach **********The two-track approach from Moscow has pushed the Reagan Administration into a two-track approach of its own -pursuing the hard line on El Salvador and making friendly comments about the idea of a summit meeting. **********Secretary Haig said yesterday that he might have found ''new and remarkable innovations'' in Mr. Brezhnev's summit suggestion and arms proposals, but he was also quick to emphasize that ''we are in no hurry'' to arrange an early meeting between Mr. Brezhnev and President Reagan. **********From the outset, the President and his Cabinet advisers on foreign policy have felt it wise to let the Russians know that they felt no irresistible domestic political pressure for a top-level meeting or arms negotiations, but wanted first to take steps to restore what Mr. Reagan, when he was a candidate, called ''the margin of safety'' in the American military arsenal. **********Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger remarked early in the Administration that it would be ''a good six months'' before Washington would be ready for full-fledged negotiations with the Kremlin on limitation of strategic arms. So far, there is no reason to suspect that Mr. Brezhnev's initiative has substantially altered that timetable. Broad Strategy Still Undeveloped **********In part, some officials concede privately, this is because the new Administration is not yet well enough organized to have devised a broad and well-formulated diplomatic strategy for dealing with the Soviet Union beyond initial charges over El Salvador and the general demand, voiced by Secretary Haig, that Moscow should agree to a ''code of conduct'' for global behavior if it wishes to pursue detente with the Reagan Administration. **********The diplomatic shorthand is that a summit meeting must be ''well prepared'' and that means, as both officials and European diplomats comment, stalling long enough to consult with top-ranking French, West German and British leaders who are now beginning a series of visits here, and then to attempt lower-level contacts with Moscow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/06/world/nuclear-readiness-of-us-criticized.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Halloran", "pub_date": "1981-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 564, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NUCLEAR READINESS OF U.S. CRITICIZED", "print_headline": "NUCLEAR READINESS OF U.S. CRITICIZED", "body_text": " **********The General Accounting Office said today that the United States lacked the weapons and the communications to carry out the basic nuclear strategy formulated by the Carter Administration and adopted by the Reagan Administration. **********In an unusually gloomy report, Congress was urged to require the Secretary of Defense to prepare and submit a plan to overcome those weaknesses when the new military budget is presented in January. **********The Defense Department, however, said that it wanted to avoid such a commitment even though it agreed with much of the assessment in the yearlong study.

But the outburst of Gallic gloom seems premature and, in the event, may prove unwarranted. **********Last week, the Bourse collapsed, the franc was sold, and French savers rushed into gold. Suddenly a huge question mark was seen over what had been considered one of Europe's strongest and most promising economies with a heavy investment in the high technology industries of the future. ''The optimism over France in the 1980's has evaporated,'' said J. Paul Horne, Paris-based European analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********Yet whatever the pledges and promises Mr. Mitterrand and his associates have made on their way to the Elysee, they may find, when they take office, that their freedom of action is severely constrained. It is hemmed in by the balance of political forces, by the realities of the French economy, by their own cautious temperament and, not least, by the conservative instincts of the French people. **********In ending 23 years of right-wing Gaullist rule, Mr. Mitterrand has certainly opened a new chapter in his country's history, but whether that chapter will mark a fundamental revamping of French industry and finance remains uncertain. **********Taken at face value, Mr. Mitterrand's economic program implies a radical departure not just from the policies President Valery Giscard d'Estaing has followed, but also from those that nearly all Western industrial countries have embraced as they struggled to rebuild their prosperity in the stagflation of the 1980's. **********Elsewhere governments are fighting inflation, moderating government's claims on the economy, and trying to save imported oil.  By contrast, the French Socialists say they will move in exactly the opposite direction with a plan for solving the country's economic difficulties that relies on a mixture of old-fashioned Keynesian pump-priming, Marxist dogma and wholesale nationalization. **********Just as France broke with recent political trends in the West last Sunday by voting Left instead of Right, it is now proposing to experiment with an alternative ''social democratic'' answer to the world economic predicament, in place of the ''monetarist'' prescriptions being tried elsewhere. As Michel Rocard, the Socialist Party's second-in-command said on Sunday night, ''Francois Mitterrand's victory is a sign of hope not just for France but for millions in other countries suffering from unjust economic policies.'' **********Demand is to be stimulated immediately by raising the minimum wage, increasing family allowances and creating 220,000 new public sector jobs. **********At the same time, the new Government is committed to increasing dramatically its control over the economy through a nationalization plan far more extensive than that put in place by the Popular Front in 1936. Its measures, if carried out, would bring another million workers onto the state payroll and make it master of companies with sales exceeding $50 billion. **********As the plan has it, France's remaining private banks and insurance companies, including the holding companies of banks like Suez, Parisbas and Banque Rothschild are to be taken over, to give the Government complete control over the financial sector and enable it to direct the supply of credit. **********The list of industrial companies to be nationalized includes two subsidaries of foreign groups, the Roussel Uclaf pharmaceutical company controlled by Hoechst of West Germany and ITT-France, whose importance has been reduced now that it has quit the telephone sector; CII-Honeywell Bull, the computer maker 47 percent-owned by Honeywell; Dassault, maker of the Mirage fighter; Rhone-Poulenc, the troubled chemical and textile company; USINOR and SACILOR, two virtually bankrupt steelmakers; and five of the companies spearheading France's drive in advanced industries - St.-Gobain-Pont-a-Mousson, Matra, Compagnie Generale d'Electricite and Thomson-Brandt, all heavily engaged in advanced electronics and computers, and part of Creusot-Loire, which builds nuclear power stations. **********The Socialists also have vowed to increase the Government's holding in the two state-controlled oil companies, Compagnie Fran,caise des Petroles and Elf-Acquitaine, take a stake in Peugeot-Citroen, the automobile maker, and give local authorities control over private water utilities. **********The object of these nationalizations, according to Michel Charzat, the Socialist Party Secretary, is ''not so much dogma but to create a piloting instrument.'' The groups would be restructured into more coherent units with only one or two companies in each sector.  Management would supposedly be free of political control. **********The Socialists also promise a new tax on private capital to reduce the inequalities of wealth, which are probably more glaring in France than in any other European country. And in a bid for the country's ''green'' vote, a useful 4 percent of the electorate, Mr. Mitterrand has promised to re-examine France's ambitious nuclear power program, which was intended to halve the country's oil import requirements by the end of the decade. **********Markets panicked last week because they assumed all this might really happen. Money fled the country on fears that a jacked up minimum wage will produce a general wage explosion, pushing up inflation and forcing devaluation of the franc later this year and tighter exchange controls. **********The Bourse, or stock exchange, collapsed because investors feared the Socialists will used their tighter grip over industry to halt the painful process of restructuring begun under President Giscard d'Estaing to preserve jobs. Competitiveness will slip, it is feared, and eventually the Government will be forced to retreat into protectionism. **********Yet much of the panic is certainly premature. Mr. Mitterrand does not yet have the votes in Parliament to even get his budget adopted, much less nationalize French companies or change tax rates. This is why he plans new Parliamentary elections for June. **********The Socialists may pick up some extra seats then, particularly from the Communists who did relatively badly in the Presidential race, but there is no prospect of their winning an overall majority. Crucial for the future of the party's economic reforms will be who they pick as allies in what is bound to be a coalition government. **********The President-elect has already said he will not bring Communists into the French Government. But even if he relies on them for Parliamentary support, the Communists are bound to press him to implement the whole economic program in return. On the other hand, if the Socialists ally with the small centrist parties that once supported President Giscard d'Estaing, they will be asked to water down their economic plans considerably. **********A third possibility is that the Giscardians and their neo-Gaullist allies will retain control of the Parliament. In this case, France is probably heading for a constitutional crisis as its elected President clashes openly with its elected Parliament. This may damage investor confidence, but while the political sparks fly, the Mitterrand program will remain in the freezer. **********Another reason why last week's panic may prove overdone lies in the personality of Mr. Mitterrand and those around him.  The new President is essentially a cautious man, a man of deals and compromises who won his spurs in the kaleidoscopic political climate of the Fourth Republic, when Governments changed like traffic lights and everything was negotiable. **********His closest associates include Jacques Delors, an experienced civil servant who has worked in the French Central Bank, and Claude Cheysoson, a member of the Common Market Executive Commission in Brussels. Both are expected to get high appointments in his first Government. Neither is a radical, and both know that the party's economic manifesto threatens to make its rule harder rather than easier. **********Nor would nationalization, with ''full and fair'' compensation, come cheap. Last week, for instance, the stock market valued St.  Gobain alone at just under $1 billion. **********Indeed, the history of the Socialists' economic program - as well as the curiously calm attitude taken by businessmen and bankers whose enterprises are actually the targets for nationalization - suggest that blueprint may never be fully implemented. **********The program and the nationalization list are the same as those agreed to in 1972 when the Socialists made an alliance with the Communists, a pact that came unstuck at the 1978 Parliamentary elections. Resurrecting it for the Presidential elections, Mr.  Mitterrand clearly hoped to again attract Communist support. He was also morally obliged to run on it after defeating an attempt to oust him as party leader last year by Mr. Rocard and a group of Young Turks who consider the nationalization plan outdated. **********Throughout the campaign the President-elect played down the more radical aspects and on several occasions qualified the nationalization plan by saying it would happen only ''when the economic conditions are right.'' **********Many Socialists say openly that the nationalization plan has become outdated. After all, they argue, the face of French industry has changed a lot since 1972, given the seven years of restructuring and reshaping by President Giscard d'Estaing to prepare it for the more difficult world markets of the 1980's and 1990's. Then, France had not made its big push into high-technology industries. Now, it has. **********During the election campaign, private bankers and industrialists, taking their cue from Mr. Mitterrand, seemed careful to avoid inflaming political passions by openly attacking the Socialist's nationalization proposals. **********The presidents of the industrial companies on the target list have been conspicuously silent. In the banking sector, Jean-Maxi me Leveque, president of the privately owned Credit Commercial de France, has been running a one-man advertising campaign against the nationalization plan, which he calls ''an irreparable error.'' But significantly, the Rothschild family and top management at the big privately owned investment banks, like Suez and Parisbas, have been invisible and inaudible. **********Privately, some of these executives argue that the Presidentelect's commitment to nationalization is uncertain and that anything said in public would make it harder for him to compromise. **********As a practical matter, few would object to nationalizing France's staggering steel industry, which the Government has already bought several times over with grants and loans.

Over the past quarter century, dozens of colonies in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean have become independent and then struggled for survival. **********But, in the case of Belize, concern has been sharpened by the fact that the new nation is part of Central America and Belize's failure to stand on its own could become a new factor of instability. **********One immediate problem is that neigboring Guatemala claims Belize as part of its own territory. And, with a population of 6.5 million compared to Belize's 145,000 inhabitants and an army infinitely superior to the 700-member Belize Defense Force, Guatemala could swallow up the new nation. **********Britain has agreed to protect Belize ''for an appropriate period,'' but, facing an annual cost of $50 million, the British have also indicated that they cannot do so indefinitely. And, in the absence of a settlement with Guatemala, Britain hopes that some force drawn from Commonwealth nations, headed perhaps by Canada, will take over its responsibility. **********The Reagan Administration, on the other hand, fears that without British troops patrolling the jungles near Belize's border with Guatemala, this country could become a conduit for illegal arms shipments from Cuba to leftist guerrillas elsewhere in Central America. Washington has therefore offered military training and weapons credits to improve Belize's security apparatus. Its Own Democratic Tradition **********Politically, however, Central America's revolutionary fever seems unlikely to prove contagious here. Belize not only has a predominately black, English-speaking population strongly identified with the Caribbean and with few links to Central America, but it has also established its own democratic tradition in its 17 years as a self-governing colony. **********Further, the principal opposit ion to Prime Minister George Price's People's United Party, which has long dominat ed domestic politics, comes from the more conservative United Democ ratic Party, while neither leftist nor militant black nationalis t groups have much o f a following. **********In contrast to most of Central America, social conditions are relatively good. Belize City, where 30 percent of Belizeans reside, suffers from a severe housing shortage that forces many people to live in dilapidated wooden shacks. But most children - half the population is under 15 years of age - attend school, 90 percent of adults are literate and health standards are considered adequate. **********The question marks about Belize's future, however, revolve around the country's economic viability. Prime Minister Price believes that independence will open the way for the country's ''economic liberation'' and he looks forward to a significant amount of foreign aid. But many foreign analysts argue that it will be difficult for Belize to generate its own wealth. Few Resources and No Industry **********Belize shares the economic profile of many former colonies: its principal natural resource, timber, was depleted by two centuries of exploitation and minimal reforestation by British companies, while its sugar industry, which accounts for 70 percent of foreign exchange earnings, is controlled by Britain's Tate and Lyle Ltd. **********A sparsely-populated territory about the size of Massachusetts, only about 15 percent of Belize's cultivable land is being farmed.  While sugar, citrus and timber are exported, one-third of the country's total imports consist of food. **********With a miniscule domestic consumer market, Belize has virtually no industry. Belize is trying to woo United States companies to establish assembly plants here, but competition is stiff from other small countries of the region and, so far, only a small textile operation has opened here. Employment opportunities in Belize City therefore remain scarse. **********One symptom is that tens of thousands of Belizeans have migrated to the United States in search of better-paid jobs. ''Anyone with any skills can earn five times as much in the states,'' said the manager of one large company. ''There is a brain drain and a skills drain that leaves Belize without its most talented.'' Considerable Tourist Potential **********As with much of the Caribbean basin, Belize does have considerable tourist potential, above all in the tiny deserted keys that run beside the world's second largest barrier reef, a mere 15 miles offshore. Last year tourism brought in only $9 million. **********But Prime Minister Price has shown little interest in major foreign-financed tourist development, arguing that it would turn Belize into a nation of ''tray-carriers'' and would, on balance, bring more cultural problems than economic benefits. **********The country is anticipating an economic boom in the coming two or three years, but this will be the result of increased foreign aid and low-interest credits from governments and international organizations to which Belize now has access, rather than because of increased production. ''It will be artificial in the sense that it will expand the country's infrastructure but won't really strengthen the economy,'' one foreign economist noted. **********The one variable that could dramatically change Belize's economic outlook as a nation is oil. At present, the country imports all its oil, yet Guatemala to the west and Mexico to the north have both discovered important oil fields and local geologists are confident that this territory forms part of the same hydrocarbon basin. So far, though, all exploratory wells have been dry."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/world/2.5-million-registered-to-vote-today-in-israel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2.5 Million Registered To Vote Today in Israel", "print_headline": "2.5 Million Registered To Vote Today in Israel", "body_text": " **********About 2,490,000 Israelis will be eligible to vote in tomorrow's parliamentary elections. **********Most polling places will be open from 7 A.M. to 10 P.M.

The increase in productivity, often considered a key factor in reducing inflation, was the biggest since the third quarter of 1977, when it rose 5.1 percent, the bureau said. **********However, unit labor costs to business were again up sharply as hourly compensation, which includes Social Security and benefit payments by employers as well as wages, again outstripped the increase in productivity by a wide margin.

Can a nuclear war be considered winnable?  A. Western political and military writers contend that Soviet military doctrine is based exclusively on the belief that a world nuclear war can be won. But that is a simplistic and distorted view of our approach. In fact, the Soviet Union holds that nuclear war would be a universal disaster and that it would most probably mean the end of civilization. It may lead to the destruction of all humankind. There may be no victor in such a war, and it can solve no political problems. **********Soviet people are not thinking in terms of winning a nuclear war but of averting such a war by all means. They take into account the changing relevance of armed forces as an instrument of politics.  Here is how Leonid Brezhnev put it: ''By and large, it is probably safe to say that people are gradually coming to understand that none of the problems in the world can be solved from positions of strength, by any sabre-rattling.'' (Speech in Alma-Ata, 29 August 1980.) **********'Limited Nuclear War' **********The same applies to the idea of a ''limited nuclear war'' in Europe or elsewhere as conceived in U.S. Presidential Directive 59 of 25 July 1980. One might discourse on ''limited nuclear war'' in theory only, but on the practical plane it is nothing less than unrealistic. **********Q. In the West one hears now and then that Soviet military doctrine is of an aggressively offensive nature, considers a first strike possible and includes plans for a sudden, blitzkrieg-style invasion of Western Europe. Is this true? **********A. That is another popular theme in Western military and political propaganda. They use a very simple ruse to adduce that Soviet doctrine is aggressively offensive. They do so by quoting from works of Soviet military theorists devoted not to doctrine or military policy but to particular aspects of combat, such as tactics in the battlefield. These quotes are passed off as Soviet doctrine, though that is a deliberately incorrect and specious approach. It gives not the slightest idea of Soviet doctrine, which is defensive but, of course, necessarily envisages the training of soldiers for various actions in the field of battle. Defensive Military Doctrine **********Soviet military doctrine is of a purely defensive nature. ''We never had and never will have any strategic doctrine other than a defensive one,'' says the declaration of the Warsaw Treaty states of 15 May 1980. It does not admit of either a first or pre-emptive strike or of any ''lightning'' invasion of Western Europe. In so doing it follows definite political, ethical and military principles. There is no aggressive element in Soviet military doctrine because the Soviet Union has no political, economic, social or military aims in Europe or anywhere else that it intends to secure by armed force. **********Q. Why then do Soviet theoretical works on military strategy of, say, the early 60's refer to offensive action, to building up a military advantage? Doesn't this prove that Soviet military strategy reposes on these principles even today? **********A. No, it proves no such thing. Soviet military strategy is neither immutable nor everlasting. It changes with the changing world. The same happens in the United States, where the strategy of flexible response and thereupon that of realistic deterrence replaced a doctrine of massive retaliation. Soviet theoretical works of the early 60's reflected the views of their time. And it was a time when the United States commanded a considerable nuclear-missile advantage, when it threatened the Soviet Union with massive nuclear strikes and declared that a nuclear war against the U.S.S.R. was winnable. Emergence of Detente **********The equilibrium of strategic forces that shaped up between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. compelled the latter to accept detente, which made considerable headway in the 70's and slackened the war danger. Technological advances and growth of nuclear weapons stockpiles had made nuclear war altogether senseless. Soviet military doctrine, which has always reposed on the principle of retaliatory, that is, defensive, action, says nothing at all in the new conditions of the 70's and early 80's of nuclear war being winnable and, more, lays the accent still more emphatically than before on preventing it, on maintaining the military equilibrium and on lowering the level of military confrontation by means of military detente. **********Q. It is said that the numerical strength of the Soviet armed forces is far greater than the country needs for defense. Is that true? **********A. The strength of the Soviet armed forces is not greater than needed for defense. It matches the defensive needs. To see this you must consider at least two pertinent factors: the regional strength balances and the g@eostrategic factor. Special Soviet Situation **********The Soviet Union's strategic situation compels it, for purposes of defense, to insure not only a general equilibrium of strength between it and the U.S.A., and between the Warsaw Treaty countries and NATO, but also a regional equilibrium in separate theaters, each with its own military specifics. To begin with, the strength of the armed forces of the Soviet Union and its allies must match the area of the territory they defend, the overall length of frontiers and the nature of the potential dangers. No other country in the world has anything even remotely equal or similar to these factors. The armies of the Warsaw Treaty countries have a territory of 23,500,000 square kilometers to defend, out of which 22,500,000 square kilometers are Soviet territory. This is more than the area of the United States, Europe and China combined. The NATO armies have only 2 million square kilometers, or one-eleventh of that area, to defend. **********Faced in the West by the NATO bloc, which includes three nuclear powers, the Soviet Union is simultaneously exposed to danger in the east from two American Pacific nuclear fleets and from China, with its growing nuclear potential and the world's most numerous army.  Furthermore, the deployment of U.S. Naval nuclear forces in the northern sector of the Indian Ocean within reach of southern regions of the Soviet Union combines with the string of U.S. military bases stretching from the Mediterranean across the Middle East to Pakistan and countries in Southeast Asia. In effect, the Soviet Union is compelled to reckon with the likelihood of a blockade being put up around it. This is being made increasingly apparent, among other things, by the growing political and military cooperation between the United States and China. An American Advantage **********Further, it ought to be borne in mind that by virtue of its favorable geographical situation, the United States can insure the defense of its own national frontiers by a minimal force. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, is compelled to guarantee proper balance and dependable defense by distributing its forces along the entire length of its borders and, moreover, insuring a rough equilibrium in the world ocean where it is exposed to growing dangers from the U.S.  nuclear Navy. **********Q. Isn't the military balance steadily tipping in favor of the Soviet Union? This can't help creating alarm in the West.  A. During the first roughly 20 years after the war, the United States had a strategic nuclear advantage over the U.S.S.R. At the turn of the 70's, the defensive efforts of the Soviet Union ended this superiority. Since then, there has been military-strategic equilibrium. **********This is acknowledged by the Soviet Union and by Western statesmen as well.  Q. Why do these statesmen say today that the Soviet Union is militarily ahead, and that Soviet-American parity no longer exists?  A. Because the U.S. Administration does not want parity. It wants the world to identify parity with U.S. military superiority. By definition, the achievement of military equilibrium by the Soviet Union means the U.S.A. has dropped behind and the pillars of peace are undermined. Spokesmen of the Reagan Administration claim that peace hinges on U.S. military superiority. Caspar W. Weinberger, for example, said on 20 May 1981 that to preserve peace the United States must have the kind of lead that it had in the 50's and 60's. **********This view is the very opposite to the opinion of the Soviet Union and many West European governments. They hold that in the present circumstances peace and international stability depend not on the superiority of either of the sides but precisely on military equilibrium. And since this viewpoint is widespread across the world, and notably among the West European public, advocates of military superiority are at pains to distort the obtaining state of affairs by irresponsible pronouncements equating parity to Soviet military superiority, and thus justifying their arms buildup. **********Q. Though that is what the Soviet Union maintains, it is continuously, developing new types of weapons. Its deeds don't match its words: it says it wants the arms race stopped. But isn't the U.S.S.R. taking an active part in it? **********A. You must look below the surface of things. The Soviet Union does not initiate new weapons. It develops them in response to the appearance of such weapons in the United States. Here are the facts to prove it: Strategic Weapons Milestones U.S.  U.S.S.R.  Atom bomb 1945 1949 Intercontinental strategic bomber 1948 1954-55 Nuclear-powered submarine 1960 1968 MRV missile (operational) 1964 1973 **********By the beginning of the 70's the United States had initiated 23 out of the 25 existing major weapons systems. And since then the number of U.S. ''initiatives'' has increased. The latest one is the decision to manufacture neutron bombs. **********Remember, too, that the Soviet Union has invariably offered to mutually renounce development every time the prospect of new still more dagngerous types of weapons appeared. At the dawn of the nuclear era the Soviet Union proposed that nuclear arms should be outlawed and their development stopped. For many years, it has been campaigning for a complete halt to nuclear tests. That would have stopped or at least greatly restricted the development of new types of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union offered the United States to mutually renounce multiple warheads (if this proposal had been acccepted, there would have been no SS-20 missile). The proposal not to adopt cruise missiles came from the Soviet Union as well. The Soviet Union proposed that no one in the world should manufacture neutron weapons. But all these proposals were turned down by the United States in its continuous pursuit of elusive military superiority."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/18/business/offer-for-treadway.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Offer for Treadway", "print_headline": "Offer for Treadway", "body_text": " **********Fair Lanes Inc., a Baltimore operator of bowling centers and fastfood restaurants, has offered to buy all the outstanding shares of the Treadway Companies that it does not already own at $12 a share, making the transaction worth about $8 million.

Currently, Citicorp employs 17,000 people in the New York metropolitan area. Although it is not expected that the establishment of a subsidiary in Delaware would reduce this number, analysts contend that it could seriously reduce any growth in Citicorp jobs in the New York region. **********The move by Citicorp is in line with similar actions taken earlier this year by the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the second-largest bank in New York, and by J.P. Morgan & Company, the fifth-largest. Tax-Reduction Motive Cited **********Citicorp's decision to establish a Delaware office was seen by some analysts as part of a strategy to apply pressure on Governor Hugh Carey, the New York State Legislature and New York City to reduce state and city taxes imposed on banks. The 26 percent tax rate comprises both state and city taxes. **********Citicorp indicated that it would shift its interest-free checking deposits, on which it makes some of its greatest profits, from Citibank in New York to Citibank Delaware. According to the New York Clearing House Association, such deposits at Citibank averaged $5.1 billion a day during the financial week that ended July 29. **********The interest-free deposits would be used to finance loans that were transferred to the Delaware subsidiary. If the average rate of interest on such loans were, say, 22 percent, the profit, before taxes and other expenses, would amount to about $1 billion of income a year. Moved Operations to South Dakota **********The strategy is similar to one used last year when Citicorp threatened to pull its large credit-card processing business, which has employed as many as 2,000 people on Long Island, out of New York. **********Citicorp had warned that if New York State failed to eliminate its ceilings on the amount of interest banks may charge on consumer loans, the bank would move its credit-card operations to South Dakota. Although the ceilings were removed last November, Citicorp established a subsidiary in Sioux Falls anyway, explaining that the bank had made a commitment to the South Dakota state government. **********In yesterday's terse announcement, Citicorp said it would invest $50 million in the proposed bank, which initially would employ more than 110 people."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/15/business/mergers-up-46-over-80.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mergers Up 46% Over '80", "print_headline": "Mergers Up 46% Over '80", "body_text": " **********The pace of corporate mergers quickened in the first quarter of 1981, rising to 599, or 46 percent ahead of the 411 in the same quarter a year earlier, W.T.

The White House, defending Michael Reagan, said he had mentioned his relationship to the President only after others had brought it up. But an Air Force officer and a civilian employee of the Department of Defense said today that Michael Reagan had first brought up the President's name, in a telephone call and a letter seeking business at the military installation that maintains Air Force One. **********Advice From Counsel **********Michael Reagan, who is 35 years old, is a vice president of Dana Ingalls Profile Inc. of Burbank, Calif., which manufactures missile and aircraft components. He is also a senior vice president of the Southern Pacific Title Company of Santa Ana. **********A White House spokesman said Michael Reagan had done nothing ''illegal or improper,'' but this afternoon the President asked the White House counsel, Fred Fielding, to advise his son and other family members to help them avoid ''even the appearance of impropriety.'' A White House announcement termed this ''a precautionary step'' taken in response to the son's request. **********Asked today whether he was going to quit his job at the Burbank concern, the President's son replied, ''I'm going to have to.'' This was so, he said, according to a tape recording of an interview made by CBS News, because the company would find it impossible to get Government work. He said the step was necessary not because of anything the company might have done, but because of the actions of the news media in reporting his activities. **********The younger Mr. Reagan referred to The Oklahoma City Times, which first disclosed the matter, as Pravda, which is the name of the Communist Party newspaper in the Soviet Union. He asserted, ''It's a stupid, stupid story.'' **********He said the news media were making it impossible for him to find work, which he needed. He added, ''I have got to make a house payment, a car payment, raise a child.'' **********He insisted, as he had previously, that he had mentioned his father in his letters only after two or three conversations in which others had mentioned the President first. **********Michael Reagan said that he spoke to the President yesterday and that he intended in the future to follow his father's advice to him, which he said was, ''Don't write any letters.'' **********The White House press office said tonight that there would be no comment on Michael Reagan's statements, which he made in apparent anger to a large group of reporters on the lawn in front of his house in the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles. **********The controversy arose when the Oklahoma newspaper found that the younger Mr. Reagan had written to Tinker Air Force Base near Oklahoma City, which, among other things, services Air Force One and other Presidential jets, asking that Dana Ingalls Profile be put on the list of businesses qualified to submit competitive bids. It later turned out that similar letters had been sent to at least five other bases. **********''I know that, with my father's leadership at the White House, this countries (sic) Armed Services are going to be rebuilt and strengthened,'' he wrote. ''We at Dana Ingalls Profile want to be involved in that process.'' Reagan Aide Explains Reference **********Larry Speakes, the deputy White House press secretary, said today that Michael Reagan had mentioned the President only because the purchasing official, Roy Sadler, had commented on the Reagan relationship in an earlier phone conversation. ''The use of the President's name in his correspondence was a reference in that letter to a conversation that he had had with the individual he was writing,'' Mr. Speakes said. **********But Mr. Sadler said in an interview today that neither he nor anyone in his office had spoken with Michael Reagan. They were ''startled,'' he said, to get a business letter invoking the President's name, and wondered how many other military bases were being so solicited. **********The President's son had earlier phoned the Air Force officer in charge of a purchasing division at Tinker Air Force Base, which buys $2 billion worth of airplane parts a year by competitive bid. In that telephone call, too, it was Mr. Reagan who first mentioned his relationship to the President, according to the officer, Col. Tom Nash. **********The colonel said Michael Reagan had called him on March 23 to find out how the Ingalls firm could get on the bid list. Colonel Nash quoted Mr. Reagan as saying, ''We need a stronger national defense.  Maybe Dad can help.'' No 'Problems' for President **********At first, Colonel Nash said, he was puzzled by the remark. He said in an interview that it was not until a few days later, when Mr.  Reagan mailed him a carbon copy of the letter to Mr. Sadler, that he realized that ''Dad'' was the President. **********Mr. Speakes said today that the President did not have ''any problems with the way Michael is doing business.'' He said Michael Reagan's associates, without prompting from him, habitually raise the kinship issue. The President, Mr. Speakes said, ''is hopeful that Michael can do business as a private citizen without the family name constantly being raised.'' **********Mr. Speakes said that Michael Reagan called his father yesterday ''because he was being hounded by members of the press corps.'' The letter to Tinker Air Force Base came to light yesterday, after The Oklahoma City Times secured it under the Freedom of Information Act. **********Mr. Speakes said he did not know if the President thought it was wrong for his relatives to seek Government business, but he added, ''The President feels Michael should have the opportunity to do business as a private citizen without the problems of his being related to the President of the United States interfering.'' Carter Guidelines Dropped **********Mr. Speakes added that guidelines proscribing Government dealings by members of the First Family - instituted by President Carter to curb his brother, Billy - were no longer in effect. Those guidelines read, ''While it could be argued that members of the President's family have the same right as any other citizens to have the Government engage in discretionary dealings with them, this is a right that is best relinquished during the President's incumbency.'' **********J. Jackson Walter, the head of the Office of Government Ethics, a Federal agency, said that Michael Reagan's actions were not illegal but represented ''a dubious kind of behavior.'' He added, ''Would this letter have been sent but for the parent situation?'' **********Harold Palmer, vice president and general manager of Dana Ingalls Inc., said Michael Reagan had joined the company as marketing vice president last December. His job is to sell its aircraft and machinery components. Following Mr. Reagan's letter, according to Air Force officials, the company was put on Tinker Air Force Base's computerized list of approved suppliers in a routine way. **********Mr. Palmer said Mr. Reagan wrote to at least five military installations that buy airplane parts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/14/business/gaf-selling-graphics-businesses.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GAF SELLING GRAPHICS BUSINESSES", "print_headline": "GAF SELLING GRAPHICS BUSINESSES", "body_text": " **********The GAF Corporation said it had sold its graphics arts business to a group of investors headed by Andlinger & Company for about $40 million. **********The purchase, by the Tanitec Image Corporation, Anitec Ltd. and Borgsate N.V., followed the signing of a letter of intent by Andlinger, a private investment and management firm based in Westchester County. **********Last December, GAF announced a major restructuring in which it would sell businesses that accounted for 45 percent of 1980 sales.

FUTURES MARKET GROWING", "print_headline": "C.D. FUTURES MARKET GROWING", "body_text": " **********Some call it a three-ring circus; others describe it as three pits. Both refer to trading in new futures contracts for bank certificates of deposit now under way on the New York Futures Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the International Monetary Market. **********The inability of bankers, securities dealers and investors to predict interest rates in recent years has created a ready market for financial futures, making it one of the fastest growing areas of the securities business. **********High and volatile interest rates have caused more borrowers and lenders to use financial futures, of which contracts on certificates of deposit are the latest entry, to protect themselves from adverse changes of interest rates. Indeed, the rosy outlook for financial futures has attracted competitors to the market. **********Choices Available **********The 90-day Treasury bill contracts offered by the International Monetary Market of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is among the dominant futures available. Others include the Chicago Board of Trade's Treasury bond futures and Government National Mortgage Association pass-through certificates. **********So far, the dominance of these contracts has not been challenged.  But the rapid growth has attracted competition from the New York Futures Exchange, a subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange that started business about a year ago, and the Commodity Exchange Inc., known as Comex. The big success at Comex, which does not trade in C.D. futures, has been its gold contract, which is by far the most active of its type. **********At the New York Futures Exchange, officials are optimistic that they will be successful with the new C.D. futures, which in less than two months have emerged as the exchange's most active contract. Contracts in C.D.'s **********The new C.D. contracts are a promise to buy or sell, at a specific price at some specificed future time, a $1 million, three-month certificate of deposit issued by one of a select group of large American banks. In trading before the delivery date, contract prices drop if interest rates rise, but if rates fall, the contract prices rise. In case of losses, the buyer or seller of a contract must either deposit additional margin with his broker, or make an offsetting transaction to wipe out the position. **********A simple hedge using C.D's. might involve a securities dealer who wanted to buy $10 million of C.D.'s from a bank, but wanted to reduce the risk of loss should interest rates rise before he could resell the certificates. By selling 10 C.D. contracts on an exchange, the dealer could offset losses on the C.D.'s purchased from the bank with profits on the C.D. futures contracts. **********Officials at all three exchanges have high hopes for the C.D.  contracts because, they claim, it fills a special need that is not satisfied by a futures contract in 90-day Treasury bills. **********Treasury bill rates are often a poor guide to changes in shortterm domestic interest rates, they say, because of huge purchases or sales by foreign central banks. Source of Funds **********Certificates of deposit, which are issued by large banks to raise money for loans they make, are a more accurate measure of domestic credit conditions, it is claimed. **********After languishing in the files of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for years, the C.D. contracts emerged in rapid succession this summer. The New York Futures Exchange started trading July 9, followed by the International Monetary Market of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on July 22, and the Chicago Board of Trade on July 29. **********While the Chicago exchanges dominate Treasury bill and bond futures partly because they were first to offer the product, analysts say that the New York Futures Exchange, although it offered the first C.D. contract, offers no such advantage. The other exchanges were quick to follow, and they still have a larger pool of active, experienced traders than does the New York Futures Exchange. Liquidity Credited **********''Chicago will remain the leader in financial futures because we have the people who are willing to risk their money to make highly liquid and efficient markets,'' said Leo Melamed, special counsel to the Chicago Merchantile Exchange. **********No exchange has emerged as a winner yet, but many analysts predict that the C.D. contract will survive at only two of the exchanges.  Richard Sandor, president of Conti Commodities and sometimes called ''the father of financial futures,'' predicted that ''one exchange will dominate the contract, with another in a secondary role.'' The experience with gold and other commodities, he said, has shown that three exchanges with the same product cannot endure. **********Officials at all three exchanges agreed that, so far, there is no clear loser in the competition for a C.D. contract. Commercial Market Essential **********John Blin, director of marketing at the New York Futures Exchange, explained that ''the two surviving exchanges with C.D.'s will be those that successfully attract the commercial users of C.D.'s - the dealers and ultimately the banks.'' A futures market that relies too much on arbitrage against similar futures contracts, and upon traders trading with traders ''is not a long-term proposition,'' he added. **********Securities dealers have so far been the biggest users of the markets, but have not shown a clear favorite among the exchanges.  ''It looks like the dealers are rotating their orders, testing and probing each exchange,'' said Mike Kijanka, director of marketing at the International Monetary Market. **********What about the banks, which are supposed to be natural users of the market because the contracts for certificates of deposit match the C.D.'s they issue? ''So far, the talk-to-ticket ratio is quite high,'' commented Richard MacWilliams, senior vice-president at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. ''There are lots of people studying the market,'' he said, but few have integrated C.D. futures into their asset and liability management decisions. Risk in Some Indicators **********The success or failure of the exchanges will be influenced by technical variations in their contracts that are important to traders and arbitrageurs. Some analysts warn that daily trading volumes and open interest data are not reliable indicators of the success of the exchanges, since those numbers can be inflated by meaningless transactions. **********In fact, at the Chicago exchanges, the published figures for estimated daily volume have exceeded the actual trading volume by as much as 40 percent, although on some days, the published volume estimates are less than the actual volume reported a day later by the clearing corporation. At the New York Futures Exchange, an on-line computer system eliminates the need for estimating volume, according to Mr. Blin. **********According to analysts familiar with the three C.D. contracts, the version offered by the New York Futures Exchange has extra appeal because it includes delivery in nearby months, and not just one month every quarter as do contracts of the Chicago exchanges. The International Monetary Market has a natural advantage, they say, because it calls for delivery in the second half of the month, while the Board of Trade and the New York Futures Exchange are both competing with contracts that specify delivery in the first half of the month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/16/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** William F.

He is also a man who has said more than once that free enterprise should be used to defend free enterprise. In other words, if a jet fighter is reliable, efficient and meets the needs of the market, it will sell. It doesn't need a handout from Uncle Sam. **********To prove it, Mr. Jones is spending $300 million of Northrop's money on a new plane, the F-5G Tigershark, the latest of the company's supersonic fighters in the immensely successful F-5 family. (The 3,500th family member was delivered last week, to Thailand.) And he is challenging a longtime industry pattern that normally calls for getting advance orders and government money to assist in the enormously expensive process of designing, building and testing new planes. **********Mr. Jones has no advance orders. In fact, he didn't even build a prototype. ''We didn't need it. We designed it right the first time,'' the 61-year-old executive said. ''When you're using your own money, you usually do what's right.'' **********As Mr. Jones tells it, the plane, to be ready for delivery in July 1983, will fit so well into the arsenals of Northrop's 28 nation clients that it will be as natural as adding a microwave oven to a modern kitchen. **********Nothing comes without a price, however, and at Northrop the price of going its own way with the F-5G has been a 77.1 percent drop in second-quarter earnings and a 37.9 percent decline in the first half. For this year and next, analysts are predicting earnings at about the same level as 1980's $86.1 million. **********But Mr. Jones is betting short-term appearances against long-term gains. ''All defense business is long term,'' said Mr. Jones. ''Five years is very close in. If a customer intends to have a meaningful force, then 10 years is a relatively short time.'' **********Northrop is, in short, something of an anomaly in the defense and aerospace industry, where government nurturing is standard and erratic performance has been the norm. Like everyone else in the defense industries, it looks forward to a mid-decade surge in business promoted by the Reagan Administration. But there the common thread is snapped. **********Northrop shuns the usual cost-plus contracts, in which the government underwrites the cost of overruns. Instead, it offers its customers a fixed price good for a number of years. The idea is to spread estimated costs over the projected sales life of the aircraft, taking the risk that the company might never break even. **********That way, Northrop may have small profit margins at the outset, when production wrinkles are being worked out, but it can predict its long-run profitability. **********Then too, except for its fighter planes, Northrop tends to concentrate its business on specific components rather than whole systems. So, unless the MX program is canceled or cutback drastically, Northrop can expect to see the completion of the $235 million contract it has with the United State Air Force to develop the MX guidance system. **********Northrop tends to spread risk by becoming involved in many projects. It has a $4.6 million contract for gyroscopes for the F-16, for example, a $112 million United States Air Force contract for radar jamming equipment, a $36.2 million contract for MX gyroscopes and a $14.7 million contract from the United States Army for an electro-optical system for the Hawk missile. **********Mr. Jones likes to keep his eye on control and quality, so Northrop has avoided government-owned plants, which its competitors widely use. He prefers to own his own facilities, where equipment can be designed to meet Northrop's needs. ''How do you improve plant and equipment if you don't own it?'' Mr. Jones asked. **********Undaunted by the evaporation of government support for research for export aircraft, Northrop is paying for its own, betting on its own technology to cut waste and its own programs to eliminate red tape.  The F-5's, whose only effective competition in world markets is the Soviet MIG, are totally export-oriented, although, because of their simplicity, the United States Air Force and Navy have bought a few for use in training. **********Only about one-quarter the size of Rockwell International, less than one-half the size of McDonnell Douglas or Lockheed, Northrop has been by far the best performer of the lot. Its stock has climbed from $10 to $53 since 1975. **********The fact is, Northrop can probably afford to take a chance with the Tigershark, the $7 million version of its lightweight, nononsense jets, even though its investment will strain its $115 million annual cash flow. (Its nearest domestic competitor is General Dynamics's F-16, with similar performance but a $12 million price tag.) **********With the $200 million capital expansion program for Northrop's portion of the F-18 and other programs, Northrop's investments will exceed $500 million in the next few years, not by any means a shocking amount. **********Mr. Jones, although he controls only about 260,059 of Northrop's 14.4 million shares, has operated the company as if it were his own for more than two decades. **********Thomas O. Paine, a former head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and a General Electric executive, came in as president in 1976, after Northrop was rocked by a questionable payments scandal. But Mr. Paine, while forming with Mr. Jones a twoman executive committee, concentrates on the nonaircraft portion of the business, which have their headquarters in Chicago, Kansas City, Hawthorne and Ventura. **********While heads rolled at other companies tainted by scandal, Mr.  Jones remains in the driver's seat at Northrop. For that remarkable feat, he has to thank his inspired salesmanship, Northrop's continued prosperity under his hand, and, as a special board committee noted, the ''absence of an apparent successor.'' **********At the beginning of the F-5 program, Mr. Jones personally convinced heads of state in Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Iran - he was a friend of the late Shah - to buy his planes. He jetted around the world arranging meetings and sales, and he built a sales network that is unexcelled in the industry for its ingenuity. **********Not only would Northrop service the planes, but the company would help finance them, help build the airstrips, train the pilots and help out with nonmilitary problems. When Switzerland signed a contract for 72 F-5's in 1976, Northrop promised to find new business for its client so that Switzerland could afford its $150 million aircraft tab. **********Under what became known as the ''Swiss offset program,'' Northrop became a promoter of Swiss products, even convincing the Pentagon to help out. It delivered $150 million worth of business, three years before deadline, and won a second round, 65 percent going to third countries, the remainder to the United States. **********Last month, Switzerland came back for an additional 38 planes valued at more than $300 million. As with the previous sale, Northrop has promised to promote Swiss business products throughout the world - this time $140 million worth of nondefense business ranging from interior design and wine presses to X-ray equipment. **********Northrop's marketing program gradually leads customers through Northrop's alphabet of F-5 fighters, beginning with the simplist available and graduating to the higher end of the model line. **********Even the high end is marked by a noticeable simplicity. While competitors built birds, Northrop built gnats -small, easily maneuverable, easily maintained, fast-flying and reasonably priced defensive weapons -that could swamp an attacker, hit and run. ''We have used our advanced technology to simplify,'' said Mr. Jones. **********The F-5 was designed primarily for American allies after it became apparent in 1956 that planes given by the United States to countries like Brazil and Turkey were too sophisticated, required too many parts and skilled mechanics. Northrop set out to develop a simple plane, one that would counteract the threat of the Soviet-built MIG-15. **********The F-5G, now up against the MIG-23, is the newest in the tradition. And, according to Northrop, it is the simplest and most reliable yet. It has a General Electric engine with 14,300 parts, 7,700 fewer than its predecessor, the single pilot F-5E and the twopilot F-5F, but offers 60 percent more engine thrust. **********And the engine is designed so that it can be broken down into six units for easy maintenance. Manpower requirements for maintenance have been reduced by 52 percent and the cost of operation and maintenance by 63 percent. Even though the plane will weigh more than the F-5E, it will take off in 28 percent less distance and climb 48 percent faster. Flying at a maximum speed of up to 1,300 miles an hour at 36,000 feet, the F-5G is 22 percent faster than the F-5E, while consuming 53 percent less fuel. **********''We have tried to look at the whole picture, the real needs of the customer,'' C. Robert Gates vice president international and the F-5G program manager, said. ''Perhaps the best feature is that we can promise our customers that the F-5G's average operational ready rate will be 80 percent. That means there will be more of them in the air, not on the ground for repair. The planes on the ground are the same as having no planes at all.'' **********''Numbers is the name of the game,'' Mr. Jones said. ''The number of planes you can afford. The number of planes in the air.'' Diversification into less cyclical businesses than aerospace might have been tempting to some, but Mr. Jones believes in keeping Northrop on a tried and true course. **********The result has been selective business expansion in areas where Northrop's reputation for advanced technology and reliability can pay off. Northrop's Wilcox Electric Inc., for example, is recognized as a leading supplier of navigational equipment with customers in more than 100 countries. The company's Precision Products division is a leader in gyroscopes. And, Northrop is the leader in the production of electronic countermeasure instrumentation, which are Soviet missile detection devices. **********''A company has to have a character,'' said Mr. Jones, who acknowledges the company is a lot like him in many ways. ''I like to think we're bold in concept and conservative in details.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/02/business/key-rates-035685.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/16/world/new-british-party-in-election-debut.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 932, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW BRITISH PARTY IN ELECTION DEBUT", "print_headline": "NEW BRITISH PARTY IN ELECTION DEBUT", "body_text": " **********''We were not willing to go on being the fig leaves for policies we believed to be detrimental,'' said Roy Jenkins, his voice rising with unaccustomed passion. ''So we have set out to create a great shift - a geological flux - in British politics. With your help we can imprint the name of Warrington on the history of our country.'' **********For the urbane and reflective Mr. Jenkins, a Home Secretary and a Chancellor of the Exchequer in Labor Governments, later president of the European Economic Community, it was a crucial moment in a most unfamiliar setting -the final rally of a furious by-election campaign in this gritty industrial borough between Liverpool and Manchester. The election, which takes place tomorrow, is perhaps the most important of its kind in Britain since the war, for it marks the electoral debut of the new Social Democratic Party. **********Mr. Jenkins and three other former Cabinet Ministers - Shirley Williams, Dr. David Owen and William Rodgers -broke away from the Labor Party earlier this year. They have signed up 55,000 members for their new party at $17 a year each. Now, in alliance with the Liberal Party, a small centrist group, and with Roy Jenkins as their standard-bearer, they are trying to capture the Labor stronghold of Warrington to give weight to their argument that both of the big parties are too extreme for the average British voter. **********''I am making no predictions,'' the candidate told 700 supporters in shabby old Parr Hall last night. ''I came here with no illusions.  But win or lose, we shall achieve a major impact.'' Jenkins Is Expected to Lose **********Mr. Jenkins is almost certain to lose. The latest poll, completed last weekend by Market and Opinion Research International, gave him only 33 percent of the vote, with 56 percent going to Douglas Hoyle, the Labor candidate, and 10 percent to Stanley Sorrell, the nominee of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party. Even allowing for greater zeal on the part of the Social Democrats, and therefore a higher turnout of their supporters than of traditional Conservative and Labor voters, Mr. Jenkins seems unlikely to get more than 35 percent of the total. **********But that would be a considerable accomplishment, in the view of political commentators here, for a party contesting its first election on decidedly unfavorable ground. Sir Thomas Williams, whose appointment as a judge created the parliamentary vacancy that will be filled tomorrow, won the seat from Labor in May 1979 with a majority of 10,274, one of the largest of that general election. The Liberals received only 9 percent of the vote. **********''Roy Jenkins has given us a good campaign,'' said a barman at the Rose and Crown pub, ''but Warrington's a Labor town, isn't it? You can tell by looking around.'' **********The constituency, which has 44,000 voters, is a collection of brick row houses dating from the Victorian era, of newer public housing developments and of factories plopped down in the midst of them - wire mills, soap plants, breweries, a distillery. It is almost entirely working-class, with only a few suburban tracts around the edges. Conflicting Views of Party **********Lord Harris, one of the Social Democrats' top organizers and publicists, said in an interview that 30 percent of the vote or more would demonstrate that the party was taken seriously even in the Labor heartland, would help it regain the momentum it generated when it was formed but has since lost, and would augur well for the alliance's chances in the next by-election at Croydon, in the suburbs south of London, sometime this fall. The electoral organization, he said, ''will have been blooded without being bloodied.'' **********''They've not taken off,'' Mr. Hoyle said in rebuttal, ''and if they can't win by-elections like this one, they'll never run the country. They should have done better with such a famous man.'' **********Mr. Hoyle, a grandfather whose neat mustache, cheerful manner and pin-stripe suits belie his reputation as a fierce left-winger, has described Mr. Jenkins as ''a traitor.'' But apart from that, he has all but ignored the Social Democrats, refusing Mr. Jenkins's demands that he say whether he is supporting Tony Benn, the left's leading ideologue, in his campaign to unseat Denis Healey as the deputy leader of the Labor Party. **********Even so, Mr. Hoyle's past associations with Mr. Benn appear to have cost him some votes. Social Democratic and Liberal campaigners have distributed handbills quoting the Laborite's statement of support for The Morning Star, the Communist Party newspaper; his assertion that ''the highlight'' of his visit to Moscow some years ago was laying a wreath at Lenin's tomb, and his description of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother as a ''hanger-on.'' Had his party been able to mount a media campaign, which is not permitted in by-elections, Mr. Jenkins might have driven the point home more sharply. Unemployment Has Doubled **********As it is, most of his support seems to be coming from Conservatives upset about unemployment, which has doubled in Warrington from 6 percent to 12.8 percent in less than a year. **********Mr. Sorrell, a London bus driver, has fought back bravely, attempting to capitalize on law-and-order sentiment aroused by the riots in Liverpool, Manchester and other nearby cities, but to no avail. He is in danger of forfeiting his electoral deposit by failing to poll 12.5 percent of the vote, which would be a humiliation for Mrs. Thatcher."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/25/world/around-the-world-portugal-s-premier-faces-increasing-criticism.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Portugal's Premier Faces Increasing Criticism", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Portugal's Premier Faces Increasing Criticism", "body_text": " **********Portugal's political crisis deepened today as Prime Minister Francisco Pinto Balsemao came under open attack from his Christian Democratic coalition partners. **********Minister of State Basilio Horta, the No. 2 figure in Portugal's center-right Government, criticized the Prime Minister in a radio interview as politically weak.

Boliva got its third Government in little more than a year Sept. 4 when the ruling junta, which less than two weeks before had declared its three members to be co-presidents, made one of them, Gen. Celso Torrelio, the army commander, the single President. **********The junta acted under pressure from a group of young hard-line colonels allied with Gen. Luis Garcia Meza, who was forced to step down as President a month ago by another group of officers who charged that he was corrupt. **********General Torrelio is considered an honest man, but whether he will be a figurehead or will forge his own administration is unclear. **********Economy Is Foundering **********Bolivia, one of the most impoverished countries in South America, has averaged more than one government a year since independence in 1825, and chagrined Bolivians say this latest bout of instability is particularly inopportune. When decisive action has been needed to deal with a foundering economy, the Government has been largely paralyzed. **********''Politics here are surrealistic,'' a European diplomat said.  Officials concede that the Government is virtually bankrupt.  Bankers and economists report that it bounced $12 million to $15 million in checks on United States banks before closing down all exchange operations in August for one month. **********The Finance Ministry now reports that it has since built up $96 million in reserves, against $268 million in short-term obligations and an unclear amount of long-term payments due this year out of a total foreign debt of $3.7 billion. Credit Is Restricted **********Most international banks have restricted their lines of credit to the country. The junta has pledged it will not devalue the peso, though the country continues to run balance of payments deficits and black-market dollars have been in demand at up to one-third above the official price. **********The lack of dollars has cut imports and forced a drop in production at a time when the economy was not expected to grow in any case.  Unemployment, poorly measured, is clearly rising, and inflation is running around 30 percent. Wages have been frozen for the last year. **********The tragedy is that Bolivia has only 5.5 million people in a land the size of Texas and California combined, is rich in unexploited minerals and farms only 2 percent of its arable land, according to agricultural and mineral experts. **********Almost 80 percent of the country's gross national product is produced by the state, much of it through the state mining company, Comibol, the Finance Ministry said. But the state enterprises have been historically inefficient. Gen. Abel Martinez Mendez, general manager of Comibol, said 13 of its 14 production companies were losing money. Cocaine Trade Thrives **********In the meantime, the illicit cocaine trade is thriving with the aidof senior mil itary officials, and one result is that the country is denied the in ternational economic help it needs. The United States withdrew its Ambassador last year and, with many other countries, hasreduced aid. **********Even the Government acknowledges its shaky position. ''The polity is unstable, capricious and chaotic,'' Adolfo Linares Arraya, Minister of Planning and Coordination, said.  ''The predominance of crisis situations has made the future unforeseeable.'' **********The junta of three service chiefs, former allies of General Garcia Meza, came to power after a rebellion in August by a group of officers who said they wanted to end corruption. The rebels fell short of taking over the Government, although they did force the resignation of General Garcia Meza. The junta members - General Torrelio, Gen. Waldo Bernal of the air force and Adm. Oscar Pammo - were unable to attract much loyalty from within their services. **********They could not be faulted for want of trying, however. They issued a flurry of economic and administrative decrees, such as one limiting public spending, but their actions were met with widespread cynicism in the military. Army Chief Exiled **********General Torrelio, 48 years old, was little known before General Garcia Meza appointed him Interior Minister earlier this year and then, in June, made him Commander in Chief of the army after sending the existing chief into exile for plotting against him. **********General Torrelio had reportedly been opposing efforts to make him President, preferring instead to remain head of the army.  General Bernal, who had been the de facto head of the junta, said that General Torrelio's appointment as Presi dent was the result of aconsensus within the armed forces. No formal meeting of senior officers took place, however, and some said t he choice was more a putsch by the hard-line colonels, with others who hoped to stabilize the Government behind a single President who at least has an image of honesty acquiescing. **********The reformists, whose center of support is Santa Cruz, 350 miles east of here, are led by Gen. Lucio Anez. The former commander, Gen.  Alberto Natusch, retired to his farm after he inexplicably called off the August rebellion. **********Overlooked in the recent political maneuvering has been the country's civilian political leaders, most of whom are spread around South America in exile.

Reagan Criticizes Senators **********Such crew assignments had been suggested as a means of allaying the misgivings of some members of Congress about the sale of the planes to the Saudis. President Reagan today strongly criticized senators who oppose or are leaning against approval of the $8.5 billion sale of Awacs and other air combat equipment to the Saudis. **********''They are literally doing away with our ability to continue to try to bring peace to the Middle East,'' Mr. Reagan said of the senators.  As he left the White House for a weekend at Camp David, Mr. Reagan told reporters, ''We're trying to find out if there is anything that can persuade these people, without in any way presuming on the good will of the Saudi Arabians, anything that can persuade some of these people to see common sense on this.'' **********The President's remarks reflected disappointment at the assessment given to him earlier in the week by Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the Senate Republican leader. Senate sources said Senator Baker had told the White House that there was little, if any, chance that the Senate would agree to the Saudi arms sale unless some changes were made in it. **********At meetings yesterday at the White House and in the offices of Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, a complicated formula was discussed at length, according to sources familiar with the discussions. A Continuing U.S. Presence **********There was a suggestion that the Saudi Government permit some, per haps two o r three, United States Air Force personnel to fly as part of the 1 3-member ''mission crew'' that handles the complex electronic ge ar in the cabin of an Awacs plane. The four-member flight crew t hat flies the plane, and is subordinate to the mission crew commande r, would c onsist entirely of Saudis. **********This continuing American presence on the aircraft would presumably ease the fears of some senators who believe that the Awacs planes could pose a threat to Israel. **********Another feature of the proposal discussed yesterday, the sources said, was a plan to equip the Saudi Awacs planes with militarily sensitive communications and ''electronic counter-countermeasure'' gear being developed for United States Awacs to resist enemy ''jamming,'' or electronic deception measures. **********Senator Glenn, who said last week that he opposed the outright sale of Awacs to any nation, had also complained that ''it made no sense'' to deliver what he called a ''downgraded'' Awacs to the Saudis because it would not be able to communicate effectively with United States naval aircraft in an emergency in the Persian Gulf. **********If Saudi Awacs continued to be operated by joint crews, fear among senators that secret technology might be compromised would presumably be reduced. **********Another feature of the proposal discussed yesterday reportedly called for a review of the arrangement by both Governments five years after the planes are delivered, or about 1991. If the Saudis then wanted to terminate the joint-crew arrangement, the United States would reportedly have to buy back the Awacs. **********The Saudi Government, represented at these discussions by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, an air force officer who is looking after Saudi interests in the Awacs debate, reportedly said it could not accept important features of the proposal. **********The Saudis did not feel that their sovereignty and political position in the Arab world would permit them to ''agree in writing to a guarantee'' of shared control of the Awacs past 1989, the authoritative sources said. A 'Training Label' **********Some United States uniformed Air Force training personnel will be assigned to Saudi Arabia, along with civilian contract maintenance personnel, to continue the training that Saudi Awacs personnel will receive in the United States and on an Awacs simulator, which is part of the arms package. The Saudis told Mr. Glenn and the White House that they could agree to having Americans fly on their Awacs until about 1989 if they had a ''training label,'' the sources said. **********The Saudis reportedly wanted to make a public statement indicating that they could not accept the proposal as outlined yesterday but were urged to remain silent by the White House. **********Some proponents of the sale, both in the executive branch and in the Senate, were opposed to a compromise anyway, believing that the best course would be to try to guide the unmodified proposal through Congress. A senior Senate staff member said he regarded that plan as ''riding your horse over the cliff.'' **********The Senate Armed Services Committee heard secret testimony in closed session today on aspects of the sale from the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, Adm. Bobby R. Inman. Later the committee chairman, Senator John Tower of Texas, said, ''The arrangement as it currently stands is a good arrangement.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/27/business/pitney-to-end-copier-research.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pitney to End Copier Research", "print_headline": "Pitney to End Copier Research", "body_text": " **********Pitney Bowes Inc. said it was dropping most of its copier research and development and that it had no plans to develop new copier products for manufacture. **********The company recently announced plans to begin marketing copier products developed and manufactured by other concerns, **********Pitney Bowes has announced agreements to market Ricoh Ltd.'s 9600 series of table-top copiers and a console copier supplied by the Minolta Camera Company.

Already, the State Depatment has asked American dependents of oil company personnel to leave Libya, and policy planners have gone so far as to consider the option of ordering the companies to leave Libya as a means of pressuring Col. Qaddafi, the Libyan leader. **********''Whether a cutting off of purchases of the oil is going to be a useful tool is something we continue to look at,'' said Robert Flaten, the State Department's Director of North African Affairs.  ''We don't close any option.'' **********Libya ranks as the third-largest oil exporter to the United States, behind Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. For the first four months of 1981, its daily exports to this country averaged 473,000 barrels a day, a figure that has probably since plunged to less than 450,000 barrels daily. In the first four months of 1980, Libyan exports to the United States averaged 630,000 barrels a day. Sign of Turmoil **********Libya's surprise meeting summons is indicative of the current turmoil in world oil markets, as Saudi Arabia has deliberately flooded the world market with cheaper oil to force high-priced producers, such as Libya, to lower their prices. The Saudis have been motivated by a desire to first stabilize prices and then implement a pricing formula to make future increases more predictable. **********Saudi Arabia is also known to be concerned that the price of oil has risen so rapidly that oil consumers will switch to alternative fuels well before the kingdom's major reserves have been depleted. **********Last week, the four African members of the 13-member OPEC cartel called for a special meeting to try to resolve Saudi Arabia's dispute with the other members. Presumably, the purpose of such a meeting would be to convince the kingdom to agree to cut its output and raise prices in return for agreements from other OPEC members to slash prices and decrease the size of surcharges for differences in quality among various grades of crude. **********Although Iraq has also come out in favor of the OPEC meeting, going so far as to say it could take place as early as Saturday, oil analysts were far from convinced OPEC would convene soon. Such a meeting could take place, they said, only if Saudi Arabia wanted it.  So far, the kingdom has said nothing. Dominance Seen Unlikely **********Analysts also suggested that Libya was unlikely to take the lead in reducing prices to bring OPEC together, and generally discounted the possibility that the meeting was called for that purpose.  Compared to more populous oil-producing countries with larger development needs, Libya can better weather low levels of oil production. **********''Nigeria has been much more hard-pressed than Libya,'' said Gary Ross of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. He and other analysts said they believe that Nigeria would logically be the first African producer to compromise with Saudi Arabia. **********In a separate development, Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a trade publication, yesterday reported that Mexico had responded to the soft oil market by cutting its price by $1.90 a barrel. The publication based its report on company sources, and noted that the Mexican Government has not yet officially confirmed the move. If true, the move would make the average export price of Mexican crude $30.70 a barrel, restoring all but 10 cents of a $4 price cut declared by Mexico in June, and later reduced to a $2 cut."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/13/world/austria-angered-by-stand-of-plo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 348, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AUSTRIA ANGERED BY STAND OF P.L.O.", "print_headline": "AUSTRIA ANGERED BY STAND OF P.L.O.", "body_text": " **********A spokesman for Chancellor Bruno Kreisky of Austria said today that Austria might suspend its contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization or even close the P.L.O.'s office in Vienna because of the organization's outbursts of joy at the slaying of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt. **********Chancellor Kreisky said in a radio interview over the weekend that the jubilant reaction by leaders of the P.L.O. might have consequences for Austria's ties with the organization.

The F.C.C. promised last year to promote the concept of low-power television, giving minorities and others greater access to television and furthering competition. The concept has not been formally approved, but the commission wants to let the new stations on the air on an interim basis. Low-power stations would broadcast with a weaker signal than regular stations and thus cover only a neighborhood, not a whole region. **********Established television stations are wary of new competition from low-power stations, despite their modest size. The present stations fear that many operators would tie the new stations together by satellite and create new networks - a strategy the F.C.C. supports.  Some large businesses (such as the Allstate insurance branch of Sears, Roebuck & Company) are seeking hundreds of the proposed ministations. F.C.C.'s Original Action **********As a way to get low-power stations on the air quickly, the commission voted Jan. 8 to cut off the first wave of applications, effective last Friday. The F.C.C. said the applicants could then go ahead and put as many as 15 stations each on the air, even though the concept has not been formally approved. **********The National Association of Broadcasters, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the ABC network and established stations immediately sent angry letters to the commission demanding an extension of the deadline so that current broadcasters could also apply for some of the new stations. After the complaints poured in, last Thursday the extension was announced. **********The effect of the extension is to let broadcasters or other opponents block new stations besides applying for their own, according to commission staff members. The process could keep many proposed stations off the air indefinitely. While new stations that are unopposed could have gone on the air quickly, the filing of competing applications starts a process that could tie them up while each applicant's bid is studied. **********Erwin G. Krasnow, general counsel of the N.A.B., wrote a letter dated the same day as the Jan. 8 vote, saying the commission should extend its deadline because it had not let present broadcasters know that they were qualified to apply for new stations themselves. Threat of a Court Test **********''N.A.B. therefore requests a 60-day postponement of the Jan. 16 cut-off date - which involved hundreds of frequencies that otherwise will become immune from potential competing applications by now eligible radio and television broadcasters,'' Mr. Krasnow said in his letter to the commission. **********The Corporation for Public Broadcasting threatened to go to court.  It asked that the commission instead go through the exhaustive process of compiling a table of frequency assignments for cities such as was done when television was originally authorized more than three decades ago. **********The F.C.C.'s lawyers, noting the specter of litigation, advised the commissioners to extend the deadline one month as a compromise.  All of them except Robert E. Lee voted for it in an informal poll. **********Possible casualties of the new extension could include Community Television Inc., a proposed network of low-power stations across the South. It would have become the first TV network owned by blacks. **********Andrew Schwartzman, director of the Media Access Project in Washington, said the low-power applicants would fight any attempts to tie up their plans with red tape. ---- Turner's 25 Applications **********ATLANTA, Jan. 18 (AP) - Turner Television Stations, a subsidiary of the Turner Broadcasting System, has filed applications with the Federal Communications Commission for the right to operate 25 lowpower television stations in 15 states and the District of Columbia. **********Ted Turner, chairman, said, ''The establishment of a network of low-power stations in cities across the country will provide an additional source of alternative programming for millions of television viewers.'' **********The company said material for its proposed low-power network would consist of advertising-supported information and public affairs programming on a full-time basis. It would originate at Turner's broadcast facilities in Atlanta and elsewhere. **********Distribution of programming to the proposed stations would be via satellite and conventional routing, the company said.  The states in which Turner stations have been requested are Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/10/business/api-trust-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "API TRUST reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "API TRUST reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/30/world/soviet-cotton-crop-hurt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Cotton Crop Hurt", "print_headline": "Soviet Cotton Crop Hurt", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union's cotton crop, one of its most reliable hard-currency earners, appears to have suffered from heavy rains and unseasonably cool temperatures in central Asia this year, according to the newspaper Izvestia.

Or- **********Countdown preparations for the Wednesday launch of the space shuttle continued trouble-free. Page D15. ders are expected to extend production at least to the middle of the decade for Deltas, produced by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation; for Atlas-Centaurs, produced by the General Dynamics Corporation, and for Titans, which are made by the Martin Marietta Corporation. **********Contrary to the optimistic predictions in the 1970's, Government and industry officials say the re-usable shuttles may never entirely put the one-shot expendable rockets out of the launching business. **********The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, under pressure from the communications satellite industry in particular, is refurbishing and modifying a second launching pad here to handle the heavy demand for future flights by upgraded Delta rockets. Many communications satellite customers continue to ''double book,'' putting down deposits on shuttle reservations and on the Deltas, too. The agency has commitments for nearly 30 Delta flights through 1985. 'Mixed-Fleet' Concept Studied **********The United States Air Force, which maintains five to seven Titan 3D rockets in readiness for its communications and surveillance missions, does not plan to begin its transition to shuttle operations until 1985. There is a feeling among Air Force planners that, even then, it would be unwise to be dependent solely on the shuttle. **********The concept of a ''mixed fleet'' is now being studied by the Air Force under the leadership of Brig. Gen. John H. Storrie, who heads the new Directorate of Space at the Defense Department. A mixed fleet would presumably include shuttles - two of the four planned vehicles are to be available to the Air Force - the Titan 3D's that are now the military workhorses and perhaps some new expendable rockets. **********The planned five-day mission of the Columbia, scheduled to be launched here Wednesday morning, will thus be followed with great interest by its future users, commercial and military. NASA plans a conference in December to brief shuttle customers on the vehicle's performance and scheduling. **********Joseph B. Mahon, NASA's director of expendable launch vehicles, said in an interview, ''In the next few months more people will have to make decisions on whether to count on the shuttle or fall back on the expendables.'' **********Uncertainties about the shuttle stem from the space agency's budget crunch and questions concerning the frequency of flights. Budget reductions ordered by the Reagan Administration could force NASA to defer or even cancel production of the fourth shuttle, now scheduled for delivery in 1985. Fewer Shuttle Missions Planned **********Even with a fleet of four vehicles, the shuttles cannot yet be counted on to handle the volume of traffic that was once envisaged.  Engineers are unable to give a realistic estimate of the time that will be required for ground maintenance between flights, but they no longer speak of a two-week turnaround capability. The original schedule of 48 shuttle missions between now and late 1985 has been reduced to 32 and may be reduced further. **********Most of NASA's customers, both domestic and international communications carriers, would prefer to have their satellites deposited in orbit by the shuttle because the price is right. Mr.  Mahon said that costs for launching a satellite with a Delta rocket run about $25 million; the same size satellite, about 2,750 pounds, would cost about $12 million to launch from the shuttle. **********Customers double-booked on the shuttle and Delta must make a choice 30 to 33 months before they want the launching. If they choose the Delta rocket, NASA would then place the production order with McDonnell Douglas and the customer would begin making quarterly payments. Under the arrangement, NASA is reimbursed for all launching costs, including the rocket itself, but is barred from making any profit. **********After the first shuttle flight, last April, eight customers that had to make a choice went for the shuttle six to two. The two that chose the Delta rocket, Satellite Business Systems and the RCA Corporation, wanted the assurance of an early launching because of their own economic commitments. RCA, for example, needed to deploy a replacement for its Satcom satellite that failed last year. Atlas-Centaur Launchings **********Mr. Mahon said that double-booking was not permitted for the larger satellites requiring the Atlas-Centaur rocket, but at least 10 flights are expected between now and 1985. Both the United States Navy and Intelsat, the international satellite communications organization, have placed orders. An Atlas-Centaur launching costs about $55 million, or about twice what it would cost to send a comparable 5,000-pound satellite aloft in the shuttle. **********Shuttle charges for the first three years amount to introductory offers. What the real costs are for shuttle launchings and what those charges will be eventually will depend, in large measure, on the frequency of shuttle flights and a minimizing of ground maintenance. **********Mr. Mahon said that Intelsat and other customers were ''taking a hard look'' at the European Space Agency's Ariane rockets as a possible alternative to the shuttle, or even to Delta and Atlas-Centaur rockets. The fourth test launching of Ariane is scheduled for Dec. 18 at Kourou, French Guiana. **********Once the Arianes, which are conventional, three-stage expendable rockets, are cleared for regular operations after the next flight, they will be boosting two Delta-size satellites on one rocket or one Atlas Centaur-size satellite. Intelsat has already booked a couple of Ariane launchings. The Grumman Corporation of Bethpage, L.I., is the Ariane marketing agent in the United States and is negotiating with several potential customers. **********Both European and American space officials say they believe that there will be more than enough business, probably from the communiciations industry alone. The Texas real-estate investors who created Space Services Inc. of Houston apparently think that there is room in the launching business for private entrepreneurs. But their expendable rocket, called Percheron, exploded in its first test last summer. They say they will try again in about a year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/06/world/salvador-farm-program-is-described-as-enduring.html": {"writer_name": "Janet Battaile", "pub_date": "1981-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 886, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SALVADOR FARM PROGRAM IS DESCRIBED AS ENDURING", "print_headline": "SALVADOR FARM PROGRAM IS DESCRIBED AS ENDURING", "body_text": " **********El Salvador's land redistribution program is described by American advisers helping to carry it out as one of the most extensive ever attempted in Latin America. **********Those involved also say it is too far advanced to be reversed despite attempts to undermine it by both business interests and elements of the left that would prefer a collective approach. **********Pressure from impoverished farm laborers for land ownership has been a major source of political violence in El Salvador, where close to 40 percent of the five million inhabitants lived under a virtually feudal agricultural system dominated by 300 large landowners. **********With the political and economic support of the United States and international bankers, the military-civilian junta expropriated the large sugar, cotton and coffee plantations last March and turned the land over to 60,000 farm families who had been cultivating it. In April, 150,000 more families assumed ownership of 500,000 acres of sharecropped property on 7,500 medium-sized holdings. **********Most of Land Distributed **********Now these 210,000 families, totaling some 1.2 million people, legally own the land they till and no longer pay rent to their former landlords. Under the program, 90 percent of the expropriated property has been turned over to two-thirds of the country's landless peasants. Specialists say the it is proportionally the most extensive land redistribution program in Latin America. **********''We've changed their title from feudal serf to freeman,'' asserted Bob Dougherty, executive director of the American Institute for Free Labor Development, an arm of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. that has been advising El Salvador on agrarian matters since the mid-1960's. **********''This is a revolutionary approach, not only in terms of the numbers involved but in the way it's being done. More than a million people are now individual private capitalists in a way whose only parallel is the Homestead Act in the eary days of our own country.'' **********The large estates are being kept intact, he said, and farmed cooperatively, with the former laborers now owning as much as 17 acres apiece. However, legislation giving them title to the property remains to be completed. **********Compensation to the former landholders, in the form of cash and government bonds, also remains to be carried through. Under the March and April decrees, the new peasant landowners are to make annual payments over 30 years that would equal the amount the Government is to pay the former owners. **********The delay in completing these arrangements has added fuel to the opposition, the one-time landlords and their families who have lost claim to large inheritances, as well as left-wing agitators who are taking advantage of the legal loopholes to try to prevent the transfer of land from going forward. **********But Americans who are helping carry out the program believe the process is irreversible.  ''There is no way to reverse this short of all-out civil war,'' said Roy L. Prosterman, a University of Washington law professor who has worked on such projects in a dozen developing countries and who spent about four months in El Salvador last year. Although he thinks a civil war can be avoided, he acknowledges it remains a possibility.  'Reform Can't Be Stopped' **********As an adviser to the Free Labor Insitute, Dr. Prosterman worked closely with Michael P. Hammer and Mark D. Pearlman, his one-time law student, who were killed by terrorists in San Salvador Saturday night. The two employees of the institute were advising Jose Rodolfo Viera, director of El Salvador's Institute for Agrarian Transformation, who was also killed in the attack. **********''It is obvious that the people who killed them want to kill land reform,'' Dr. Prosterman said in an interview. ''But this reform can't be stopped by assassin's bullets.'' **********Rupert Scofield, an assistant to Mr. Hammer, who had worked for the Free Labor Institute for 17 years, mostly in Central and South America, said he had flown to El Salvador Saturday to consult with Mr. Viera about reports that the latter was to be dismissed as head of the agrarian project. Mr. Viera also directed the Savadoran Communal Union, a peasant farmer group organized in 1966 with the help of the Free Labor Institute. **********''It's unquestionably a blow,'' Mr. Scofield said of Mr. Viera's death and those of his two colleagues. ''But whether it's mortal or not, we don't know. Our preference is to keep pushing, using all our influence to keep the project going.'' Farm Workers' Support Cited **********He and others remain somewhat optimistic, citing the enthusiastic support of the farm workers and the continued high crop yields since the land transfers last spring. **********''The left has been exhorting the campesinos to burn their own crops so as to paralyze and destroy the economy,'' he said. ''But the farmers aren't going along because they're benefiting. They now have a stake in the Government and the economy.'' **********''Now they are not working just for a wage, but for a share of the profits,'' he said. ''And they've suddenly built up an enormous equity. **********''Even those who at first found the reform distasteful are going along.

The trip is meant to reverse that perception in Africa, officials said. **********As issued by the White House, the statement was also meant to signal that although this Administration would have its own policy toward southern Africa, the effort of the preceding Administration to bring about an international settlement removing South-West Africa from South African control would be continued in consultation with black-led African nations and white-dominated South Africa. **********Referring to South Africa's policy of racial separation, it said ''there can be no question of American support for apartheid, which is repugnant to our multiracial and democratic society.'' **********But it said ''we intend to make our views plainly known'' to the South Africans ''not in a spirit of confrontation but of constructive help.'' **********On the deadlocked negotiations for an independent South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, it said, ''We seek a peaceful solution of the Namibian problem leading to a genuinely independent and democratic Namibia, recognized by the international community.'' **********Administration officials said that in the long policy review of southern Africa that has just been concluded, there was a consensus to discuss with the Africans the possibility of a significant shift in the independence plan. This also would be discussed with the four countries, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada, that had been working with the United States as the ''contact group'' in United Nations-sponsored negotiations on the issue. **********Until now, the United Nations plan has called for United Nationssponsored elections in South-West Africa for a constituent assembly.  The South Africans and their supporters in South-West Africa, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, have been reluctant to accept that approach in the fear that the main guerrilla group, the South-West African People's Organization, led by Sam Nujomo, would prevail and be able to dictate the country's future. **********The American approach is said to incorporate aspects of the solution that led finally to international acceptance of a government of Zimbabwe, the former Rhodesia.

At present, personal service income is taxed at a maximum rate of 50 percent; non-earned income is taxed up to 70 percent (except long-term capital gains, which are reduced by 60 percent first, thus being taxed at a 28 percent maximum).

Others close to the situation, however, insisted that such talk was just part of the bargaining process. **********Asked if the proposal was friendly, Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental, said in a telephone interview: ''Yes, absolutely. I would not be a party to an unfriendly merger with anybody.'' **********Wall Street professionals, sensing further developments, bid up the price of Zapata stock by 3 3/4 points, to 31 5/8 in heavy trading.  The offer, which Zapata described as unsolicited, is understood to have been arranged by David H. Murdock, a multimillionaire West Coast businessman and a director of Zapata. He is a close friend of Dr. Hammer's. Iowa Beef Deal Recalled **********Mr. Murdock is Zapata's largest stockholder. He had nearly 2 million shares when his holding was last reported in February. He was also instrumental in arranging for Occidental to buy Iowa Beef Processors in June for $800 million in stock. **********Mr. Murdock, who has holdings in a number of corporations, had owned 19 percent of Iowa Beef and thus became a significant stockholder in Occidental. He would become an even larger Occidental stockholder if the Zapata deal is completed, because it would involve a transfer of Occidental shares. **********Zapata said the offer called for its shareholders to get 0.6904 Occidental common share plus 0.1804 share of a new $100 Occidental preferred issue for each Zapata share. Based on Friday's market close, the offer was valued at about $36 per Zapata share, or a total of $763 million. Based on yesterday's close, it was valued at $35.56 a share, or $754 million. The value changes daily with the price of Occidental's stock. **********Without commenting on the proposal, B. John Mackin, Zapata's 64-year-old chairman, said it would be ''taken under consideration.'' In a separate statement issued later by Occidental, Dr. Hammer said he had met last Satur day with Mr. Mackin and other Zapata executives and had made a written proposal. Offer Open for 45 Days **********The Occidental statement went on to say that the offer was open for 45 days and might be withdrawn after that. It added that, if the merger went through, Zapata would keep its headquarters in Houston and would continue under its present management as an independent company.  People fami liar with the talks said that, much in the manner of theIowa Beef dea l, Mr. Murdock brought Dr. Hammer and Mr. Mackin together and that the two met in his office near Los Angeles. **********Although Mr. Murdock is known as an astute investor who rarely embarks on a venture without elaborate study, Zapata's executives were said to have gone only ''as a matter of courtesy.'' There were signs that the Zapata officers knew what to expect. Just the day before, they had retained the Wall Street firm of Lazard Freres for advice. Mr. Mackin is understood to have told Dr. Hammer that his directors would ''evaluate the offer and take a position,'' but he added: ''Zapata is not for sale. It's not looking to sell.'' **********Commenting on the rationale for the Iowa Beef venture, Value Line, the investment survey, noted last July that Occidental had $117 million in unused investment tax credits at the end of 1980 and that it pays no Federal income tax because it consistently loses money in the United States. Thus, the advisory service said, post-acquisition income would be ''enhanced substantially'' by applying these credits to Iowa Beef's profits. Tax Credits Increasing **********Dr. Hammer said yesterday: ''The same will hold for Zapata if we do it. Our investment tax credits are increasing substantially because we're investing more money in coal mines and chemicals.'' **********He added, however, that the main reason his company wanted Zapata was Occidental's ''very ambitious'' offshore oil expansion program in which he said it would spend some $2 billion in the next five years. **********He said Occidental would need Zapata's offshore drilling rigs - especially its five semisubmersible ones. He said he was also interested in Zapata's oil operations in the Gulf of Mexico and its coal holdings, which he described as ''not large'' but interesting. **********Zapata was founded in 1954 by George Bush, now Vice President of the United States, and the Liedtke brothers - J. Hugh Liedtke, now chairman of the Pennzoil Company, and William Liedtke, chairman of the Pogo Producing Company, a former Pennzoil subsidiary. **********Mr. Bush sold his Zapata interest in 1966 when he was preparing to run for the House of Representatives. The founders, looking for a catchy name with an international flavor, are thought to have taken the name Zapata from a contemporary movie, ''Viva Zapata,'' starring Marlon Brando and Anthony Quinn."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/30/world/a-bomb-race-in-the-offing-news-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Kaufman", "pub_date": "1981-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 977, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Analysis", "print_headline": "A-BOMB RACE IN THE OFFING?; News Analysis", "body_text": " **********The simmering suspicions dividing India and Pakistan are again becoming inflamed, this time raising the prospect of the first nuclear arms race between countries that are not superpowers. **********It is almost exactly seven years since India demonstrated its nuclear muscle with an underground blast in the Rajasthan Desert.  Now, as evidence mounts that Pakistan is striving to build an atomic weapon, voices are being raised here calling for quick and open pursuit of the nuclear option. Over the last few weeks there has been a steady stream of articles by military strategists and technicians, some of them close to the Government, urging a nuclear arms program for India to counter Pakistan's presumed atomic ambitions. **********Assertions that India is preparing an underground test site, allegations based on United States intelligence reports, have drawn only perfunctory official denials. As in Pakistan, the flexing of nuclear muscle is domestically popular though internationally embarrassing. **********A Western diplomat who has been closely monitoring the nuclear politics of the subcontinent said he believed that the tunneling near the site of the 1974 blast was still part of contingency planning and that no final decision had yet been made here whether to set off another device. 'We Have to Be Prepared' **********The diplomat said it was widely assumed that the Indians had produced several devices at the time of the first test. He added that he thought that the underground site was being prepared so that an explosion could be set off on short notice if the Government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi decided to shift from the previous policy of publicly forswearing a buildup of atomic arms. **********''We have to be prepared for any situation,'' Mrs. Gandhi said this week as she warned of heightened tensions. ''The major danger is that without anybody wanting it, there may suddenly be war.'' **********The suddenly intensifying tensions are somewhat surprising, since the underlying reasons have been apparent for years. Almost since the partition that created their two countries, Indians and Pakistanis have been ready to think the worst of each other. That India had nuclear ability and that Pakistan was actively seeking it has been known for several years. With the history of conflicts, with Kashmir remaining an unresolved and potentially incendiary issue, India and Pakistan have often regarded each other as belligerents waiting for the right moment to strike. **********It was this reasoning that led a group of political scientists and nuclear monitors in the United States to conclude that the greatest risk of nuclear confrontation in the world was in this region and not in the Washington-Moscow standoff. And yet, until this spring, the Indians showed remarkably little alarm at the reports of Pakistan's development of atomic arms, a program that Westerners describe as being some two years away from the testing stage. U.S. Seeks to Arm Pakistan **********What seems to have stirred Indian anxieties much more than Pakistan's nuclear effort is the eagerness of the Reagan Administration to arm Pakistan as a bulwark against any Soviet penetration in and around the Persian Gulf. **********With the Administration moving in Congress to change existing legislation so that United States military aid may go to Pakistan despite Islamabad's nuclear activities, the Indians are concerned. **********High officials in the Indian Foreign Ministry refuse to accept the proposed Pakistani-American arms agreement as a mirror image of India's own $1.9 billion arms deal with the Soviet Union. Instead, they take the view that the military Government in Pakistan, once afforded protection by the United States and gaining tolerance and legitimacy for its nuclear program, could easily turn to militarist adventures. **********It is also an undenied fact that despite the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the threat it represents to Pakistan's western border, Islamabad still deploys seven-eighths of its forces toward India. Calculated Ambiguity **********In reflecting the general apprehension here, Mrs. Gandhi summarized the situation with calculated ambiguity. ''There is no question of trying to compete with Pakistan in an arms race,'' she said. ''We have never complained about Pakistan being armed. Our only worry is that such arms supply is creating a situation where everybody is drifting towards a war.'' **********The day before she made these comments, K. Subrahmanyam, the director of the Indian Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, a Government-financed organization, publicly called on the country to shed all pretenses and openly amass a nuclear arsenal. **********''The time to act is not after Pakistan conducts the test,'' Mr.  Subrahmanyam, a former Defense Ministry official, wrote in The Times of India. ''That would give Pakistan an undue advantage. The time to get ready for the appropriate response is now.'' **********He also wrote: ''If we make the bomb, the United States will realize that they cannot ignore a nation of seven hundred million with nuclear weapons just as Nixon said about China in 1971. It will enable us to deal with China on an equal basis. We shall be able to sustain our cordial relations with the Soviet Union too.'' **********In the newspaper article and in several others that have appeared recently, the implication was clear that India should drop its selfconscious hesitation and call its bomb a bomb. Since the 1974 test India has clung to its insistence that what occurred in the desert was ''a peaceful nuclear explosion,'' which many contend is just as lethal as an atomic bomb. Since then India has avowed that it has produced no weapons and has no weapons delivery system. **********Now articles such as Mr. Subrahmanyam's, which is widely regarded as knowingly prophetic, are recommending an undisguised atomic arms program as the best way to deter Pakistan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/10/business/ramada-arranges-casino-refinancing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 430, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RAMADA ARRANGES CASINO REFINANCING", "print_headline": "RAMADA ARRANGES CASINO REFINANCING", "body_text": " **********Ramada Inns Inc., which has had major cost overruns at its casino-hotel project here, announced refinancing steps today that it asserted would cost the company money now but improve chances for future profits. **********Richard Snell, who took over as chairman when M.

Let me try to summarize what we said so it can be judged on its merits, for we believe it was a clear statement of where we came from and where we mean to go. **********The 16 chief executive officers of major companies who participated in developing the paper agreed that the corporate community must deal effectively with the issues in the public debate about the role of the corporation in society. This must be done by either explaining the corporate role satisfactorily or by meeting new expectations - or both. Failure to do so might mean no corporations as we now know them. **********We recognized that corporations have a responsibility, first of all, to make available to the public quality goods and services at fair prices, thereby earning a profit that attracts investment to continue and enhance the enterprise, provide jobs and build the economy. And we said that all sides must recognize the fundamental importance of profits and their contribution to the long-term viability of the enterprise: ''If the bottom line is a minus, there is no plus for society.'' **********Perhaps Samuel Gompers, father of the American labor movement, put it better when he said, ''The worst crime against the working people is a company that fails to make a profit.'' **********As shareholders make the corporation possible by providing funds for corporate birth, growth and development, we said that the interest of shareholders must be considered in all important corporate activities. **********But the character of shareholders has changed. At one time most of them were long-term, personally involved individual investors. Now large numbers of them are grouped in institutions as unidentified short-term buyers most interested in maximum near-term gain. Such interest must be balanced with a long-term perspective. The simple theory that management can get along by considering only the shareholder has been left behind in old economic dissertations. **********Chief executive officers who have been out there facing reality know that corporations are surrounded by a complicated pattern of economic, social, ethical, and political ideas and expectations. They know that they have to be concerned not only about shareholders but about such constituent groups as customers, employees, communities, suppliers and society at large. And they believe a corporation best serves its shareholders by carefully balancing the legitimate interests of all constituents. **********R EGINALD H. JONES, former chairman of the General Electric Company, put it well: ''Public policy and social issues are no longer adjuncts to business planning and management. They are in the mainstream of it. The concern must be pervasive in companies today, from boardroom to factory floor.'' **********Carefully weighing the effects of decisions and balancing different constituent interests must be an integral part of the corporation's decision-making and management process. A corporation's economic responsibility is by no means incompatible with other corporate responsibilities. **********The specifics of how a corporation addresses these responsibilities will vary from one company to another. Each corporation has an individual character, related to its products, markets, facilities, manufacturing processes and other aspects of its business. Some theorists may long for a total operational strategy or even a statute to dictate corporate responsibility, but only the naive or contentious would seek to fashion such a document. **********It is true that business enterprises are not designed to be either political or cultural institutions, but the business community will be well-served by habit of mind that stays alert to social currents.  That fundamental point carried through to the conclusion of our statement: ''A corporation's responsibilities include how the whole business is conducted every day. It must be a thoughtful institution which rises above the bottom line to consider the impact of its action on all, from shareholders to the society at large. Its business activities must make social sense just as its social activities must make business sense.'' **********We think that's good business.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Andrew C.

SMITH, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation, has an extra $500,000 a day to spend on new cars now, thanks to the Federal Government, which two weeks ago decided not to require air bags or other passive restraints on 1983 model cars. **********That's not a whole lot of money for a company that is spending a little under $1 million an hour around the clock on new plants and products. By now, more than 10 months since the inauguration of Ronald Reagan, General Motors, like thousands of other American manufacturers, had hoped to realize far greater savings from the Administration's promises to purge many of the Federal regulations of business. Deregulation to date has done little to pull the giant automobile company out of its severest slump in decades. The auto makers continue to report dismal results. In the third quarter, G.M.  posted a loss of $468 million, Ford $334.5 million and Chrysler $149.3 million. **********General Motors, for its part, is getting impatient. The savings from deregulation may come, Mr. Smith said, once they work their way through the bureaucratic pipeline and, in some instances, Congress.  For the moment, though, he takes satisfaction in the realization that, if G.M. hasn't felt much of the impact of deregulation, at least it need no longer fear adoption of new regulations. ''If nothing else,'' he said, ''our hearts are lighter.'' **********General Motors' experience with deregulation is a test not only of the Administration's promises but of its economic theories as well.  By easing the Federal grip on industry, the Administration has promised that industry could turn the resulting savings to investment in better plants and improvements in productivity. **********Not surprisingly, many of the Administration's critics contend that the deregulation that is good for General Motors is bad social policy for the country. Executives at G.M. dwell on the added costs, but environmental and safety advocates argue that the auto companies showed scant concern for clean air and safety before laws were passed and regulations written. **********Deregulation may also be bad for the economy: Certain kinds of deregulation simply shift costs from one sector to another. Prof.  William Nordhaus, a former member of the Council of Economic Advisers, has calculated that ending the passive restraint requirement will cost the country $4.5 billion during the life of the automobiles made in the 1982 through 1985 model years in medical costs, insurance costs and lost wages because of automobile deaths and injuries. **********The automobile industry was virtually free of regulation at the Federal level until the mid-1960's, when it was required to march to rules set by dozens of agencies. Today, regulators in Washington set standards for emissions, safety and mileage that affect the size, shape and performance of new automobiles as much as designers at G.M.'s Technical Center in Warren, Mich. Occupational safety inspectors prowl through factories while equal op-portunity officials have a say in who gets hired and promoted. Until earlier this year, lawyers at the Federal Trade Commission were contemplating a suit aimed at splitting the company into pieces. **********But last April, the Reagan Administration said it would assist the ailing auto industry by reducing the burden of regulation, rather than grant tax concessions and impose formal quotas on Japanese car imports, as the auto makers had requested. **********Vice President Bush, who heads the Administration's deregulatory effort, predicted that the proposed changes would save the industry $1.3 billion in capital costs and consumers more than $9 billion over five years. **********G .M. executives have calculated that complying with government regulations costs $2.2 billion annually, and that does not include the cost of the devices installed on cars to meet emissions and safety standards. Looked at another way, regulations required the efforts of the equivalent of 26,000 full-time G.M. employees, according to the company. **********''When you are making $10 billion a year that $2 billion is one thing,'' Mr. Smith said in an interview in his office on the tightly guarded 14th floor of the corporation's headquarters building. ''But when you are losing $700 million a year as we did in 1980, you look at it and say 'that's the difference between losing money and making money.' '' **********Asked if the Administration's program has had much impact on G.M.  as yet, Mr. Smith replied, ''unfortunately not.'' Although some of the 34 regulations on the April ''hit list'' have been rescinded, most have been minor. **********''The ones I think are important, the bumpers, the E.P.A., the ones that have the big money in them, we haven't seen any of those,'' Mr.  Smith said. G.M. estimates that meeting emissions standards adds $725 to the price of a new car while safety standards add $400. **********Nevertheless, the Administration has made deregulation a key part of its ''supply-side'' approach to the economy. And business has been accommodated in other ways. **********Since the advent of the Reagan Administration, Mr. Smith said there has been a change of attitude at agencies like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission that in times past tended to view corporate actions with skepticism. He said G.M.  executives who deal with Federal regulators report ''they finally listened to what we were trying to say without that look of suspicion on their face.'' **********One exception, he said, is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has been pressing a race and sex discrimination case against the company since 1974. ''I have not seen as much change at E.E.O.C. as in other places. Maybe it's just taking longer to get that one turned around,'' he said. Other G.M. executives, arguing that the company has a good record on advancement of minorities and women, say the commission has not offered any ''rational'' plans to settle the case. **********Although he can't quantify the benefits, Mr. Smith said G.M. was being aided by deregulation efforts at the Interstate Commerce Commission, which is encouraging competition in shipping, and the freeing of price controls on oil, which tend to drive consumers toward newer, more fuel-efficient cars. **********The single largest achievement of the Reagan approach to regulation, Mr. Smith said, is not so much getting rid of the existing regulations but preventing the new ones from going into effect. Shortly after assuming office, the new Administration froze dozens of new regulatory initiatives advanced in the waning days of the Carter Administration. One would have ordered car makers to include crash-worthiness ratings, based on tests conducted at 35 miles an hour, on window price stickers. **********Part of the problem in deregulation, Administration officials concede, is the bureaucratic process needed to rescind rules. In the April declaration, the Environmental Protection Agency said it would relax by mid-September three regulations dealing with heavy truck emissions and emissions tests. It did so, but the proposed revisions are stalled in the Office of Management and Budget, which has been ordered by President Reagan to review all regulatory actions. ''There was a hang-up on one point involving testing,'' conceded an O.M.B.  spokesman, Edwin L. Dale Jr.. He said the dispute had been resolved and that the new rules would be published ''shortly.'' **********A proposal to lower the bumper crash-worthiness standard from 5 miles an hour to 2.5 miles an hour has similarly met with obstacles as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration considers nine alternative propoposals. G.M. has said the 2.5-mile standard would save consumers $100 a car in fuel savings and lower purchase price.  Opponents of the change argue that car repair costs would increase. **********And Administration efforts to assist the auto industry by easing air pollution standards are stumbling over the fact that the current standards were set by Congress. Although some members of Congress have said action on the Clean Air Act is unlikely this year, a spokesman for Vice President Bush said an effort is being made to cobble together a compromise bill for action before Congress adjourns on Dec. 18. **********Mr. Smith, who favors a roll back of the standards to the 1980 levels, fears the changes may come too late to help the company through the current crunch because of the industry's long lead times. Even if the standards were revised tomorrow, he said, the effect would not be really felt until the 1983 model year. G.M. has said the stiffer 1981 standards have added $300 to the price of a car, and said the price of cars would be reduced by this amount if the standards were relaxed. **********As a result of its poor financial performance, auto industry analysts say, G.M. is being forced to reduce the number of new model cars it will bring out. Mr. Smith says the Administration needs to move more quickly if it really plans to assist the automobile industry with deregulation. **********''We're trying to be patient because we understand the necessity of rule-making procedures,'' Mr. Smith said. ''But we're getting tired of treading in the deep water and we would like a little bit of help on some of this. It just seems to be taking longer than we think it should.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/24/world/the-polish-airwaves-troops-evict-strikers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1952, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE POLISH AIRWAVES: TROOPS EVICT STRIKERS", "print_headline": "THE POLISH AIRWAVES: TROOPS EVICT STRIKERS", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from domestic Polish radio and television broadcasts as transcribed and translated from the Polish here by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, a United States Government agency End of Steel Strike 10 P.M.

Some 2,000 employees from some departments, kept in the foundry for many days by terrorists from the former Solidarity works committee, have left for home. **********Many metalurgists earlier managed to flee the works. No one was hurt during the action by the forces of order. Most of the provocateurs and organizers of the work boycott in the Katowice steelworks have been apprehended. **********The search for some of them is still in progress in the works. The investigation continues. Appeal to Strikers 2 P.M. Wednesday, (8 A.M. Wednesday E.S.T.) **********In the past 24 hours, functionaries of the forces of order have detained 357 persons who did not observe the curfew. These persons must appear before the misdemeanor courts. Speculation gangs have also been unearthed. In one of them in Tychy, goods worth 600,000 zlotys were amassed. **********The anxiety and concern of all those who desire peace and stabilization is being aroused by the situation in the Ziemonwit and Piast collieries and in the Katowice steel mill. At the Ziemowit colliery, 1,026 miners have already come to the surface but around 1,000 miners are being detained below by a group of vigilantes numbering over 100, who are applying psychological terror on the miners. **********We remind you that the work force of this colliery numbers around 10,000 persons. The miners detained below are cut off from accurate information and are being threatened with drastic punishments which they will allegedly sustain after leaving the mine. The situation is similar at the Piast mine. **********The situation in these enterprises is referred to in today's appeal by the Provincial Committee of the Polish United Workers Party in Katowice to party members, miners of the Katowice Province. We read in the appeal that enormous efforts are still being made so that all the miners of the Ziemowit and Piast collieries can spend the approaching holiday with their relatives. However, these endeavors are not having an effect because of the group of adventurers who are playing with human life in a carefree manner. **********In the appeal, words are also addressed to the families of the Ziemowit and Piast miners. We know that you are anxious about the fate, health and life of your husbands and sons. Let us help them make a decision. **********We are all waiting for this decision to be made, together with the miners' families. Meeting With Intellectuals 7:30 P.M. Wednesday, (1:30 P.M.

Wojciech Jaruzelski discussed the country's sociopolitical and economic situation under conditions of martial law. The main objective of actions taken so far is to draw Poland away from this dramatic twist of history and to overcome the socioeconomic crisis threatening the socialist state's foundations. **********Today this calls for sacrifices - sacrifices made with the future of the country in mind - for its development is linked indissolubly with the process of socialist renewal. **********General Jaruzelski urged those attending the meeting to assist in the active role of Polish scientists, intellectuals and creators in working for the salvation of the homeland, for consolidation of the state, and for building a bridge of social and patriotic agreement. **********In a long and open debate many eminent professors focused attention on the duties and targets of academic and scientific quarters in conditions of martial law. **********Views of the world of science and current national issues particularly the urgent need to rebuild trust, calm and scientific and teaching work in Polish universities, were relayed to the premier. Demands of Miners 4:06 A.M. Wednesday, (10:06 P.M. Tuesday E.S.T.) **********From the regional press review: In Silesia flashpoints continue to exist. In yesterday's Trybuna Roboinicza I came across a report entitled ''A Drama of Division and Perplexity'' and above this title was the title ''We Sincerely Hope for a Shared Christmas - A Family Affair in All Miners Homes.'' The report was prepared by journalists Jerzy Bielonski, Ryszard Zula, Jerzy Nismiec, and Andrzej Wozniak.  Here is the full text of the material from Trybuna Roboinicza: **********From the Ziemowit mine. A hopeless protest is continuing a drama of division and perplexity is being played out. It is a disagreement that is not needed today. The painful waiting of those at the surface to see what will happen is continuing. They know that life in the country is very onerous but that it is returning to normal. They want at all costs to convince their nearest and dearest of this. They value efforts to make Christmas peaceful. However the resistance of those who treat every telephone call and every appeal by a mother or wife as a lie or provocation is continuing. Sometimes even a mother's voice is treated with suspicion. **********When we visited the Ziemowit mine on the ninth day of martial law we learned that the mine was operational. But that there was no extraction. On the surface life went on as normal. Miners came in for the second shift. Those who were making sure that the mine was safe, although it was not extracting, came out freely. **********We did not notice in the vicinity of the mine or on the roads leading to it any patrol, a feature which is after all so characteristic of the streets of our towns today. Let us repeat there was not a single patrol - not an Army one, not one from the militia, nor a workers' one. Private cars entered the parking lots. **********During the course of the protest which is going on, 874 miners have already come up. Yesterday at 7 A.M. there were still 1,147 miners down in the pit out of a workforce of over (number indistinct). The people concerned with mining supervision the army officers who come through to this place all say the same, 'We are very concerned. We are doing everything and we will do everything so that these dramatic days come to an end as soon as possible. We warmly hope that Christmas will be a shared family affair in all our miners' homes. **********From the Piast mine. Since Dec. 4 in the Piast mine in Tychy a protest by part of the work force has been going on. Yesterday, at 4 P.M., 1,726 miners of the Piast mine where the work force numbers 8,300, were still down under at level 50. Among those who are ocupying the level are workers of the mining work enterprise from Myslowice. **********The protest broke out last Monday and (number indistinct) miners joined in on the first shift. Work still went on according to the normal rhythm: 7,800 tons of coal were extracted. However, following the end of the first shift, a portion of the work force then at work - about 300 persons - refused to come to the surface later the workers of further extraction shifts joined them. **********The protesters are calling for the freeing of all internees, including the deputy chairman of the plant union commission of Solidarity in the Piast mine, Eugeniusz Szelongowski, and the head of the Solidarity group of the State Mining Council at Piast, Stanislaw Dziwac: the repeal of martial law and a guarantee to all participants in this protest of security. **********Between Dec. 15 and up to 4 P.M. yesterday 24 of the protesters left occupied level 50. These remaining below are staying in the site of the main pumping plant in the air shaft, at the passenger stations and the shaft bottoms. **********Systematic telephonic communication with them is being maintained.  However, of 160 telephones which are normally in action at this level, only 7 are fully efficient. The remainder have been damaged or switched off by the protesters. **********Representatives of the directorate and officers of the Polish Army have on many occasions made contact with the protesters. However, no arguments get through to those who are occupying the bottom of the pit. **********Three priests from the Tychy parish went down. They spent several hourse at level 50, leaving it after 7 P.M. Saturday.  The priests did not obtain the permission of the protesters to go down again yesterday, on Monday, nor was similar permission given to several wives who also wanted to see (word indistinct) husbands. The protesters personally define who has the right of direct contact with them and when. Yesterday, for instance, when it was necessary to examine the condition of part of the occupied workings, in accordance with mining regulations -an inspector of the mining office was there - the protestors personally defined who was to be the inspector and they made his coming down dependent on his not being accompanied - as is customary in mining - by a team of helpers bearing the instruments essential for taking measurements. Increased Soviet Supplies 7 A.M. Wednesday, (1 A.M. Wednesday E.S.T.) **********Just a few days ago, a Polish-Soviet agreement was concluded concerning additional deliveries of food items, clothing for children, and the speeding up of Soviet deliveries of oil and gasoline; and already today we have received a report on the almost complete implementation by the Soviet Union of the deliveries offered to our country. **********At the transloading rail stations on the Polish border, 20,000 tons of rice, 200 tons of raisins and over 2,000 tons of mandarin oranges have already arrived. Also, confectionary cans of grape juice, prepared foods for children and toys have been delivered. Children's clothing, as well as half a million pairs of children's shoes, have already been sent from the Soviet Union to Poland. Reopening of Schools 7 P.M. Wednesday, (1 P.M. Wednesday E.S.T.) **********Schools will reopen on 4 January under conditions of martial law.  Maria Mazurowa, director of the General Education Department in the Ministry of Education and Training, told a Trybuna Ludu journalist that in addition to the restrictions connected with the situation in the country, there will be difficulties in transporting children to schools and a shortage of heating fuel - in other words, all the inconveniences of winter. Hence, good work organization, careful consideration by principals of all decisions and discipline among educational workers are of particular importance. We have learned that schools will be using the curriculum which has been in force to date. Lecture plans will also not be altered. However, in exceptional cases, a school principal has the right to reduce curriculum content and the right, even the duty to introduce changes in weekly schedules should conditions require them. Schools will remain on a 5-day week. Recreational activities will be organized on Saturdays."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/26/world/crisis-in-poland-part-of-us-plot-pravda-charges.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1981-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CRISIS IN POLAND PART OF U.S. PLOT, PRAVDA CHARGES", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN POLAND PART OF U.S. PLOT, PRAVDA CHARGES", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union today published the most comprehensive charges to date that events in Poland over the last 17 months were part of a long and intricate campaign by the United States to wrest Poland from the Communist camp. **********Western diplomats asserted that the 3,600-word Pravda article by Vladimir Bolshakov was less remarkable for the substance of its claims than for what it revealed about the Kremlin's insecurity and suspicion. **********Mr. Bolshakov described virtually every Polish emigre organization, thousands of Polish-Americans who returned to retire in Poland, all the supplies and donations sent to Solidarity and virtually every contact between the labor union and the West as part of a web spun by the United States Central Intelligence Agency ''to undermine the socialist statehood and to create conditions for a counterrevolutionary coup.'' **********(Asked to comment on the Pravda article, Mark D. Weinberg, the assistant White House press secretary, said in Washington: ''Charges similar to these have been made in the past. There was no truth to them then and there is no truth to them now.'') **********Martial Law Not Discussed **********Under the headline ''On the Interference of the Special Services of the U.S.A. in the Affairs of the P.P.R.,'' Mr. Bolshakov said the C.I.A. declared a ''full-scale secret war'' against Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia in the early 1950's under the code name Redsox-Redcap. After revolts in Hungary and Czechoslovakia were put down by Soviet forces, the C.I.A. made Poland its prime target, he said. **********The article did not discuss Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's declaration of martial law on Dec. 13 and referred only in passing to ''a number of miscalculations of the leadership in economic and social policy.'' Rather, Mr. Bolshakov's focus was almost entirely on what he described as the ''old plans of imperialism for the restoration of capitalism in Poland, for wresting the country out of the socialist community, above all from the Warsaw treaty organization.'' **********The intent of the article, whose length suggested high-level approval, was apparently to provide authoritative and detailed support for the claim that Poland faced the threat of a coup by C.I.A.-backed foes of Communism among Solidarity's leaders. **********The immediate purpose of such a claim was evidently to justify martial law in Poland, but the underlying theme of a plot against the Warsaw Pact suggested that the article could also be used to justify Soviet intervention if it comes. **********''The White House did not conceal that the events in Poland were a subject not only of political but also of strategic interest for the U.S.A.,'' Mr. Bolshakov wrote. An Attack on the System **********He said a special panel set up under Vice President Bush to follow events in Poland had received a special directive to explore ways of aiding ''Polish counterrevolutionaries.'' **********The article concluded, ''Those who are hatching such aggressive plans and conducting a new crusade against Poland under Dulles' banner of 'rolling back Communism' should be reminded that the socialist community has repulsed lovers of such ventures more than once.'' **********Mr. Bolshakov composed a picture of a concerted attack on Poland's Communist system, manipulated and financed by the C.I.A. and other Western intelligence services and using ''well-organized units'' of many thousands in Poland and 400 centers outside. **********Mr. Bolshakov said the C.I.A.'s campaign to create a ''controlled crisis'' in Poland led to the establishment of an organization of East European emigres in 1975 that helped found and finance the dissident Polish organization KOR. **********The committees of independent trade unions set up by KOR in Gdansk and Katowice became the nucleus of Solidarity, the article said. Radio Stations Cited **********Throughout this period, Mr. Bolshakov said, KOR acted in concert with other dissident groups backed and financed by Western intelligence services, and the activities of ''that whole antisocialist rabble'' were directed by the American radio stations Radio Liberty, Radio Free Europe and the Voice of America. The Voice, Mr. Bolshakov said, broadcast instructions in cipher to the Polish underground. **********Mr. Bolshakov described with disapproval the Polish Government's practice of letting Polish-Americans visit and settle in Poland, a policy unthinkable in the Soviet Union, which regards all its own emigres with suspicion. **********''Ten thousand American citizens were resident in Poland in November 1981, among them quite a lot of people who were openly hostile to socialism or agents of the U.S. intelligence services,'' he said. **********Mr. Bolshakov said that by the time Solidarity was formed in August 1980, the ''antisocialist'' forces had a network able to take control of it quickly. **********He continued: ''From the very beginning, the U.S. Administration oriented itself to the counterrevolutionary top leaders of 'Solidarity.' This was done evidently in the belief that the seizure of power in Poland by the 'Solidarity' leaders is a matter of the near future.'' **********Pravda went on to enumerate what it called Solidarity's foreign sources of support and funds, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O., linking most organizations with the C.I.A. The 400 centers of support abroad secretly sent several million dollars to Poland, the paper said. U.S. Denies Charges Special to the New York Times **********WASHINGTON, Dec. 25 - When asked for comment on the Pravda assertion of United States manipulation of Solidarity, Mark D.

SHIFT: OUTSIDE SUPPLIERS", "print_headline": "G.M. SHIFT: OUTSIDE SUPPLIERS", "body_text": " **********The General Motors Corporation, historically the domestic automobile company most committed to producing its own components, is looking increasingly to outside suppliers as a means of lowering its labor costs, according to the company's chairman, Roger B. Smith. **********''It's a matter of being competitive in the marketplace,'' Mr.  Smith said, after predicting that the practice, known as ''outsourcing,'' would become more common throughout the American automobile industry. He said that as a result of the General Motors effort, some of its plants might close. **********In a meeting on Monday with a group of reporters and editors at The New York Times, Mr. Smith touched on a broad range of topics affecting General Motors and the auto industry, but saved his strongest remarks for labor issues. **********Critical of Wage Rates **********Mr. Smith said that American auto workers had ''priced themselves out of the market.'' In addition to spurring manufacturers to buy more components from nonunion suppliers and overseas automobile companies, he said, labor was encouraging the replacement of people with automated equipment because of its high wage rates. **********''Every time the cost of labor goes up $1 an hour, 1,000 more robots become economical,'' he said.  Since becoming chairman of the company, Mr. Smith has tried to modify the labor contract negotiated by his predecessors in September 1979. The United Automobile Workers union, however, has refused to reopen the agreement, which extends until September 1982. G.M. and the Ford Motor Company have said that their labor costs of about $20 an hour put them at a severe disadvantage with their Japanese competitors, whose labor costs are about $12 an hour. **********Mr. Smith's emphasis on controlling labor costs appeared to be part of the public buildup leading to the 1982 labor negotiations, in which it is generally expected that G.M. will be the target company for the union. **********Mr. Smith said he believed that an agreement would be reached without a strike, noting that union leaders understood the industry's difficulties and the threat to jobs posed by decisions to produce more components outside the auto companies. But, he added, union leaders were trapped by the skepticism of their rank-and-file members. 'They've Overreached' **********''There's got to be a realization on the part of the union that they've overreached,'' Mr. Smith said. ''They've stampeded this herd of buffalo by telling them they are underpaid. Now they've got to tell them they are overpaid in relation to the competition.'' **********He said that General Motors was prepared to offer profit-sharing in return for reduced labor costs, but balked at job guarantees, a demand that the union's president, Douglas A. Fraser, has said would figure prominently in the talks next summer. **********''What good is a job guarantee when the result is uneconomical? Mr. Smith asked. ''What happens if the company goes broke? It doesn't do any good to give a false sense of security.'' **********Mr. Smith declined to predict how well the 1982 models would sell, breaking with a long industry tradition of issuing optimistic sales forecasts. ''You tell me what interest rates are going to do and I'll tell you about the automobile market,'' he said. **********Most other auto industry leaders have been forecasting car sales of about 10.5 million in 1982, compared with about 9 million this year, although they have generally said that interest rates would have to decline for the 1982 prediction to be reached. **********When the new ''A''-body intermediate-size models, the ''F''-body sports models and new small pickup trucks are introduced later this year and early next year, the company will be about two-thirds through its ''downsizing'' program, Mr. Smith said. The program is intended to increase fuel efficiency. Still to be redesigned, he added, are the company's larger cars and its vans. Fuel Economy Stressed **********Although some auto makers, notably Chrysler, will stop making larger cars entirely, Mr. Smith said that G.M. would continue to make cars in all sizes. ''People don't want small cars,'' he said, ''they want fuel-efficient cars. So we say, you can have any size car you want and it will be fuel-efficient.'' **********Conceding that he disagreed with some of G.M.'s own marketing experts, Mr. Smith said he believed that Americans who formerly purchased large cars were not likely to shift their allegiance to compacts. Instead, he said, he believed that such consumers would simply repair their present cars until they are attracted back into the showrooms by a new generation of more fuel-efficient large autos. **********Commenting on the Reagan Administration's economic program and its effect on the automobile industry, Mr. Smith said that while he generally favored the Administration's course, there had been little impact so far. ''We could get substantial benefits from the Reagan tax program in later years, but it won't help much this year,'' he said. Similarly, he observed that the impact of the Administration's deregulation efforts was largely in proposals not yet enacted, rather than in existing regulations revoked. May Buy foreign Steel **********In addition to looking overseas for components produced at low wage rates, Mr. Smith said that General Motors was considering the purchase of foreign steel. Virtually all of the company's steel is now bought from American mills, but Mr. Smith said: ''We're looking hard at outsourcing. You've got to in this environment.'' **********Increasingly sophisticated automated manufacturing equipment and computer control of car operations will be the major technological innovations of this decade, Mr. Smith said. In cooperation with machine tool companies and on its own, G.M. has been concentrating on developing a generation of industrial robots that can recognize different parts, no matter how assembled, and install them accurately despite changes in the pace or alignment of items on the assembly line. ''I'm trying to get them out of the labs and into the plants,'' he said. **********Computer control of engine and transmission operations is reaching the point, he added, that cars equipped with a computer-controlled automatic transmission may soon get better mileage than those with standard shifts, the traditional mileage leaders. **********''We now can understand and control the engine as never before,'' Mr. Smith said. But, he added, he expected improvements in automobiles to be a series of adjustments rather than a technological breakthrough. ''One of the best things about automobiles,'' he said, ''is that each has about 15,000 parts. There's always got to be a way to put them together cheaper, better and faster.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/15/business/methematica-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "METHEMATICA INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "METHEMATICA INC reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/07/business/advertising-pando-takes-new-post.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pando Takes New Post", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Pando Takes New Post", "body_text": " **********About a month ago, Alan O.

In a research reactor of the Osiris type this means, in the first place, to insure that fuel elements supplied from abroad are checked on arrival and that from that moment on continuity of knowledge is maintained on their location and integrity. The primary measures used for this purpose are item accounting, identification and containment and surveillance. The design of the facility and of the fuel elements is such that they provide assurance that the diversion of fuel elements would be detected with very high probability.1 **********Production of Plutonium **********The second possibility of diversion in a facility of the Osiris type is based on the undeclared production of plutonium. As the fuel elements consist of highly enriched uranium, only very small quantities of plutonium can be produced in them. Larger quantities, perhaps up to the order of one significant quantity2 per year, could only be produced if the core of the reactor were surrounded by a blanket of fertile elements made of natural or depleted uranium. The size and location of this blanket would be such that ordinary visual inspection would reveal its presence. The production of plutonium in fertile elements located underneath the reactor is practically impossible since the core is placed on a thick concrete slab, which in turn is lined with a heavy steel plate. These provide shielding to permit maintenance work on control element drives located in a vault below the reactor to be carried out. The Conclusion **********The existence or otherwise of undeclared underground installations has no influence on the detection capability of the I.A.E.A.'s inspectorate at reactors of the Osiris type. In such a transparent pool reactor, the absence of fuel elements or the presence of undeclared fertile elements for plutonium production would be easily detected. **********In conclusion, in a reactor of this type, diversion of fuel elements or of undeclared plutonium produced at low rates cannot be technically excluded but would be detected with very high probability. **********It should, of course, be borne in mind that it is not the task of the agency to search facilities or installations which do not contain safeguarded material. **********May I end by saying that the presence of a large number of technicians from the country which has delivered the reactor could also be expected to provide some assurance.  ---- Explanation of technical terms: 1-''Very high probability'' means, in this case, a full guarantee, since the main inspection activity is counting about 60 fuel elements, which are individual objects of considerable size.  Additionally, measurements are made that prove that the elements are not dummies.  2-''Significant quantity'' is an amount of special fissionable material sufficent for manufacturing - after processing losses -a single nuclear explosive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/13/business/sun-unit-selling-its-retail-assets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sun Unit Selling Its Retail Assets", "print_headline": "Sun Unit Selling Its Retail Assets", "body_text": " **********The Sun Company said that its Sun Gas Liquids Inc. marketing subsidiary had reached a definitive agreement to sell its retail assets to Synergy Group Inc. for an undisclosed amount. **********Synergy Group, which is engaged in propane distribution, leisure and energy-related consumer products and material handling equipment, will acquire all retail facilities and merchandise in 80 branch outlets in nine Southern and Middle Western states, but Sun said that the sale did not include its wholesale liquefied petroleum gas business. **********Sun said that the sale, which will close by the end of the year after a Government-required waiting period, is part of its continuing assets redeployment strategy, which will channel more capital into energy exploration and production."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/28/world/around-the-world-nestle-said-to-have-paid-for-rights-nominee-s-list.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Nestle Said to Have Paid For Rights Nominee's List", "print_headline": "Around the World; Nestle Said to Have Paid For Rights Nominee's List", "body_text": " **********Ernest W.

Woolworth Company, reported declines. This disappointing performance spurred many industry analysts to reduce their already low third-quarter profit forecasts for retailers. **********Retail earnings for the three months ended Oct. 31 will trickle out later this week, and analysts are predicting declines of as much as 60 percent from the comparable period a year earlier. **********Most Important Period **********But it is the Christmas season and its strategic influence on the fourth quarter, the most important period of the year for retailers, that is of the most concern to industry analysts. **********''It looks like it will be a decent Christmas season but nothing to write home about,'' said Terence J. McEvoy, vice president and analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. He added that the small October sales gain was the result of a substantial cutback in consumer buying that ''reflects a less than inspiring national economy.'' **********Industry executives are also apprehensive about the Christmas season. ''The recent sales numbers show some deceleration in sales compared to the spring season,'' said Howard Goldfeder, chairman and chief executive officer of Federated Department Stores Inc., which owns Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus, as well as other leading stores. 'It Could Be Weaker' **********''I know of little reason why that should not continue, although Christmas occupies a special niche in the heart of the American consumer,'' he said. ''But I doubt that the season's business will be better than it is currently and it could be weaker.'' **********Fabian Linden, director of consumer research and an economist for the Conference Board, a business research group, is also pessimistic. ''At this moment, the Christmas shopping season doesn't look especially promising,'' he said. ''The fact that unemployment is up means that sooner or later there will be a decline in disposable income.'' **********''Although there's an avalanche of opinion for a rough recession, I think it might be much too early for so dreary a prognosis,'' he added. ''It's hard to think of a big bust without a preceding boom.''  Associated's Chief Optimistic **********William P. Arnold, chairman and chief executive officer of the Associated Dry Goods Corporation, is a bit more optimistic. He expects ''a very strong Christmas, although I was somewhat depressed by the consumer's reaction of the last three weeks.'' He attributed the slowing sales pace to widespread consumer interest in the taxexempt savings certificates offered by banks. **********Mr. Arnold, whose company is oriented toward higher-income consumers and operates Lord & Taylor, Joseph Horne's in Pittsburgh, J.W. Robinson in Los Angeles and others, expects that President Reagan's tax cut and ''more disposable income on the part of our customers mean that we'll have a good season; if people don't spend money for cars, homes or go on expensive vacations, then they will have it for us.'' **********One retail analyst, Jeffrey M. Feiner of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, expects sales during the holiday season to increase by less than the 8 percent rise registered last Christmas. **********''We believe that the continued generally difficult economy, high interest rates, the sluggish employment trend and the declining consumer confidence levels are all likely to result in continued sluggish sales for most retailers,'' he said. **********Edward Johnson, director of the Johnson Redbook Service, a division of Prescott, Ball & Turben, said that a number of company thirdquarter earnings have been reduced ''mainly due to lower than expected sales increases, high interest rates and lower gross margins due to higher promotional sales.'' **********He added that earnings estimates for all of 1981 ''could prove too high if the current slowdown in consumer expenditures accelerates and results in a disappointing Christmas season.'' Big Woolworth Drop Forecast **********As for the third-quarter results soon to be announced, Robert J.  Simonson, an analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company, expects the biggest year-to-year decline, 62 percent, to be reported by Woolworth. He attributes the drop to ''sharply higher interest costs and a negative swing in foreign currency adjustments, together with profit declines in all major geographic areas, the United States, primarily at Woolco and Kinney Shoes, Britain, West Germany and Canada.'' **********He estimated that Woolworth would report third-quarter results of 30 cents a share against 79 cents the year before.  The Allied Stores Corporation, Carter Hawley Hale Stores and the Dayton-Hudson Corporation will be reporting quarterly earnings blunted by pressure from a sales slowdown and sharply higher interest costs, according to Mr. Simonson. Allied is expected to have quarterly earnings of 67 cents a share, down 14 percent from last year's 78 cents a share. Carter Hawley is expected to have 27 percent lower earnings in the quarter, 27 cents a share against 37 cents, he said, while Dayton-Hudson's earnings will be up 8 percent, to an estimated $1.35 a share from $1.25 in the 1980 period. **********The K mart Corporation, the second-biggest retailer after Sears, Roebuck & Company, will have virtually no gain in third-quarter earnings, reporting an estimated 25 cents a share, the same as last year, according to Mr. Johnson of Johnson Redbook. Mr. McEvoy of Dean Witter concurs in the estimate. Rise Expected for J.C. Penney **********But the J.C. Penney Company is expected to have a 19 percent rise or even higher gains in its quarter's earnings. Mr. Simonson expects Penney to report $1 a share against 84 cents in the 1980 period but Mr. McEvoy estimates its earnings may be as high as $1.05 a share.

Major energy projects were postponed and uncertainty about the course of Canadian energy policy helped to depress the Canadian dollar. **********C. William Daniel, president and chief executive officer of Shell Canada, echoing the view of other businessmen interviewed, called the agreement between the federal and provincial governments ''the best news the Canadians have heard in years.'' He said that settlement of the dispute over oil pricing would give the economy a strong boost. **********Forrest Rogers, economic advisor to the Toronto Dominion Bank, said the agreement ''should be helpful in a broad variety of ways,'' a major advantage being the impact on federal revenues. In this regard, Finance Minister Allan MacEachen, who is expected to present a budget this autumn, said in Ottawa that the agreement reduced the need for increased personal income taxes. **********Under the agreement between the federal Government and the Province of Alberta, which accounts for more than 90 percent of Canadian oil production, the federal share of revenues from oil and gas is to be increased to 29 percent from 10 percent. Alberta's share would drop to 34 percent from 45 percent, and the industry share would drop to 37 percent from 45 percent. Praise Not Unanimous **********Despite the initial euphoria, however, an undercurrent of dissatisfaction became evident as analysts studied the agreement's effects upon the oil industry. **********Ian R. Smyth, executive director of the Canadian Petroleum Association in Calgary, Alberta's capital, said that a preliminary study of the complex agreement showed that ''well over 90 percent of the energy price increase will go to Government. Where do we get the cash flow for development?'' **********Mr. Smyth, whose group represents mostly the big, integrated oil and gas companies, said it was ''obvious that the two governments have satisfied their financial objectives. Now let's see what's left over to the producer.'' **********The agreement, signed in Ottawa by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Alberta's premier, Peter Lougheed, will provide an estimated $54.3 billion (in Canadian currency) in revenues for Ottawa, $64.3 billion for Alberta and $94.2 billion for the oil industry between now and the end of 1986, when the agreement expires. It became effective immediately. **********Alex Squires, energy analyst for Pitfield Mackay Ross Ltd., a Toronto investment firm, said that a provision in the agreement for a two-tier price structure would have widely different revenue effects on companies that were current producers and those that discovered oil in the future. **********In a system comparable to that in the United States before oil deregulation, the price of currently produced ''old oil'' - that is, oil discovered before last Jan.1 - will rise to 75 percent of the world price by mid-1986, while the price of ''new oil'' - from new fields, oil sands and the Arctic frontier - will rise to the world price. The current before-tax domestic price of Ca nadian crude oil is about $17.76 for a 42-gallon barrel, a bit mo re than half the weighted average international price of $34.1 3 a barrel. **********Yesterday, the oil and gas index on the Toronto Stock Exchange rose 140 points - almost 3 percent - to 4,937.5 in anticipation of the Trudeau-Lougheed announcement, which was made shortly after the market closed. The index fell 9 points today. **********Mr. Squires said that the 75 percent figure, which would affect mostly the major integrated companies that were largely foreign controlled, ''seems inadequate. It will likely result in a decline in cash flow from old oil.'' However, the newer companies, and the established concerns that find oil in future, stand to benefit from the full world price. **********Two Alberta oil sands plants, the A lsands consortium led by Shell Canada of Tor onto and the Cold Creek project, led by Imperial Oil Ltd. of Toron to, have been stalled by the 16-month dispute. **********The projects, each valued at about $12 billion, are now likely to go ahead, Mr. Squires said, and the world price for their production will benefit the companies in the consortiums. He noted, however, that the projects would not be completed until the late 1980's. **********Speaking of the agreement's effect on the economy as a whole, Mr.  Rogers, of the Toronto Dominion Bank, said the agreement ''will improve the general business and political atmosphere, which has been soured by the dispute. Strength for Dollar **********He expressed hope that the Canadian dollar will continue to strengthen. It closed on the foreign exchange market today at 83.58 cents in United States currency, up from 83.13 cents yesterday and a 50-year low of 80.43 cents on Aug. 4. **********Roy A. Phillips, president of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, cautioned that ''this agreement will be meaningful only if the energy industry is provided with adequate returns. Otherwise there will not be enough exploration, development and production in Canada to reduce, or even maintain at current levels, our dependency on imports.'' **********One company with no reservations about the agreement was Suncor Inc., a Toronto subsidiary of the Sun Company, of Radnor, Pa. Last autumn, Ottawa withdrew Suncor's right to charge the world price for oil from its Alberta oil sands plant, but that price method was estored as part of yesterday's agreement. **********Ross Hennigar, president and chief executive officer, said the decision ''will move the plant from a marginal operation to one with a strong future.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/business/business-conditions-uncertainty-over-jobs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 284, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNCERTAINTY OVER JOBS", "print_headline": "BUSINESS CONDITIONS; UNCERTAINTY OVER JOBS", "body_text": " **********Lags in reporting changes in how small businesses are coping with high interest rates have some analysts worried that official Government employment statistics may be overstated. **********No one, apparently, can estimate small businesses' ability to create new jobs. **********A variety of studies lead Gregory Kipnis, chief economist at ACLI International, a commodity service firm, to conclude that businesses with less than 100 employees have accounted for between 70 and 80 percent of total employment growth in the past decade.

As a consequence, the B.L.S. adjusts its employment figures to account for changes in small business formations. **********Currently, Mr. Kipnis estimates the B.L.S. adds nearly 130,000 jobs to its employment numbers each month to account for small business expansion. ''Over the life of the business cycle, the adjustment is probably accurate,'' Mr. Kipnis said.

However, since mid-1979 the gap between the two indexes has been widening. And, with new business formations declining each month since December, Mr. Kipnis estimates the B.L.S. may have overstated nonfarm employment by as many as 500,000 jobs through April."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/26/business/resurgence-of-sweatshops-reported-in-new-york.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1866, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RESURGENCE OF SWEATSHOPS REPORTED IN NEW YORK", "print_headline": "RESURGENCE OF SWEATSHOPS REPORTED IN NEW YORK", "body_text": " **********violations (page D11) By SANDRA SALMANS **********Concealed behind painted-over storefronts and crowded into shuttered lofts and cellars, sweatshops are reappearing in garment manufacturing in the New York area, Government investigators and union officials say. **********According to these investigators, the sweatshops are spreading from Chinatown, where they took root long ago, to Washington Heights, Inwood and the South Bronx, and extending into Queens, Brooklyn and even Staten Island. Sweatshops have also been found in northern New Jersey and parts of Westchester. **********''It's exploding,'' said Herbert Rickman, special assistant to Mayor Koch.  While sweatshop conditions vary, there is a grim sameness to the basic appearance: rows of women bent over sewing machines, separated by narrow aisles often made impassable by dress racks and piles of piece goods. Fire exits and windows, too, are often blocked or even padlocked, reducing emergency escapes to a rickety freight elevator and unlit stairs. For 30 employees, there may be only a handful of time cards - with stamped times that bear little resemblance to the actual hours worked. **********Even the most reputable garment factories tend to be crowded and cluttered by modern standards. Sweatshops, however, may fail to comply with minimum wage and hour laws, child labor regulations and fire and safety codes laws. 50,000 Workers Estimated **********Precisely how many sweatshops and sweatshop workers there are in New York is impossible to determine. In a report to be released today, State Senator Franz Leichter, who represents an upper Manhattan district where many sweatshops have recently sprung up, estimates that some 50,000 people are employed in as many as 3,000 sweatshops in the apparel trade. Ten years ago, according to Senator Leichter, there were only 200 sweatshops in the city, half of them in Chinatown. The industry's official estimate of total employment in New York is less than 200,000, but no one dismisses the sweatshop figure as improbably high. **********The resurgence comes nearly 70 years after the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory, where 146 garment workers died. The notorious episode is invariably invoked by government officials in discussing the situation today. **********Increasingly, the workers are illegal aliens - from Hong Kong, South Korea, the Dominican Republic, Haiti or Latin America. Lacking work permits and sufficient knowledge of English, they are easy targets for exploitation. The flow of immigrants from these areas is generally cited as a main factor in the revival of sweatshops, which were believed to have declined sharply in the city following reformist legislation and union activity in the 1930's and 40's. **********As Herman Starobin, research director of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, noted, ''There's a growing garment-producing operation in the midst of a completely different culture.'' **********Government, union and industry officials cite several reasons for the growth of the sweatshops: **********- Budgetary cutbacks have compelled government departments to reduce the number of inspectors and deploy them in top-priority sectors, which do not include garment manufacturing. **********- The large inflow of immigrants, both legal and illegal, has created a sizable and trained pool of workers who are easily exploited. **********- Indifferent or ineffectual officials in government and the I.L.G.W.U., the main union responsible for organizing garment factories in the New York area, are cited by some garment manufacturers as contributing to the problem. Many Chinatown factories are unionized but are often found in violation of city building and fire codes. **********- The contracting system, in which apparel companies parcel out the production of garments to small, highly competitive contractors and subcontractors, is said to encourage the companies to put a squeeze on wages while obviating any sense of responsibility. **********In theory, a number of government departments are responsible for policing the apparel trade and imposing criminal and civil penalties. But, apart from some much-publicized periodic raids - the most recent of which occurred some 18 months ago in Chinatown - inspection and policing have been sharply curtailed as a result of budgetary cutbacks, officials say. When inspections are carried out, they are often handicapped by a lack of interpreters, especially in questioning new immigrants from South Korea or South Vietnam. Number of Inspectors Cut **********For the five boroughs, the buildings department has only 69 inspectors to examine construction, issue violations and pursue recalcitrant owners. The fire department has only 150 inspectors, down by 100 from several years ago. Instead of annual inspections, ''we might hit between 10 and 15 percent of the buildings each year,'' said Paul Kotch, the department's inspector-general. Payoffs of inspectors by contractors, Mr. Kotch acknowledged, were an additional problem. **********While the city's authority covers only building and fire codes, the United States Labor Department is supposed to inspect for machine safety, minimum-wage and overtime payments, and the employment of minors. But since the Chinatown raids in 1979, the department has turned its attention to higher-priority industries. **********''We don't normally make inspections unless we get complaints,'' said Nicholas DiArchangel, deputy regional administrator in New York for the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration. He added: ''Very few complaints come from sweatshops. They don't speak English, and they're afraid.'' **********While garment manufacturing is admittedly not a high-risk trade, OSHA inspectors are supposed to insure that sewing machines have needle guards to protect seamstresses' hands. But in sweatshops, where workers tend to be paid by piecework and productivity is the foremost concern, the workers themselves resist using guards, saying the guards slow them down, Mr. DiArchangel said. **********''If I tried to enforce it, I'd be doing someone out of a livelihood,'' he added. ''Do you get punctures - which can become infected - or do you feed your children? It's that basic.'' **********Paying for piecework, the norm in garment sweatshops, is not illegal as long as workers receive at least the minimum wage of $3.35 an hour. ''But in most cases, people can't possibly make the number of pieces to come anywhere near the minimum wage,'' said Frank Mercurio, regional director of the Labor Department's Employment Standards Administration. **********Mr. Mercurio's department has found sweatshops where workers were averaging $1.50 an hour for a 50-hour week. To show a 40-hour week on their records, inspectors say, employers often punch time cards in and out dutifully as workers remain at their machines, not collecting overtime for extra hours. **********To raise their income, inspectors say, garment workers increasingly take work home. The practice, largely banned by state and Federal law, removes workers from public scrutiny and makes law enforcement difficult. **********It is widely agreed that sweatshop workers are easy to exploit because many are recent immigrants, lacking adequate English, fearful of government and accustomed to substandard wages and working conditions. If they are here illegally, they are even more vulnerable to abuse by employers. **********''Undocumented workers are afraid,'' Mr. Starobin said. ''That fear allows employers not to pay Social Security or withholding tax, and to fight efforts to unionize. If the workers protest, he threatens to tell the Department of Immigration about them. Legally, they're unpersons. The less documentation they have, the more serious the violations are apt to be.'' Union Cited as Part of Problem **********Some manufacturers suggest that the I.L.G.W.U., as a result of ineffectual leadership, is partly to blame for the resurgence of sweatshops. **********''Why blame someone who gives work to people?'' said Myron Norris, owner of Givenchy for Little Tantrums, which makes children's apparel under license from the designer. The company uses a contractor in Chinatown. ''Why not blame the Mayor, or the union for not enforcing the contract?'' **********Union officials insist that they are working harder than ever to organize garment workers, including illegal aliens. Of the 110,000 I.L.G.W.U. members in the New York area, as many as 30 percent are estimated to be illegal immigrants. **********The Seventh Avenue manufacturers are the guilty ones, says Frederick Siems, I.L.G.W.U. executive vice president. ''The name of the game is price,'' he said. ''Sweatshop operators bid on garments, and the one who is most desperate gets the work. These manufacturers know what's happening.'' **********In the view of Mr. Siems and others, contracting, the traditional method of garment manufacturing, is fundamental to the perpetuation of the sweatshop. Typically, apparel manufacturers send their cut or piece goods to contractors to be sewn; the contractors, in turn, may subcontract the work. **********The system encourages fly-by-night operators who, in a seasonal industry, manufacture for a few months, pocket their profits and close. ''It isn't difficult to find a loft where you can put 30 or 60 machines, and you're in business,'' Mr. Mercurio said. ''It's a fastbuck operation. It's just like a pusher - the police kick him off one corner, but in a week he resurfaces on another.'' 'We Can't Police Him' **********Contracting also removes the manufacturer from direct responsibility for the treatment of workers. ''When we give a contractor an order, we can't police him,'' said Mr. Norris of Little Tantrums. Mr. Norris has a representative visit his Chinatown contractor daily to inspect the garments' quality but not wages or working conditions. ''If they're breaking the law,'' he said of his contractors, ''the city should close them down.'' **********Government representatives also charge that the truckers, who convey piece goods from the manufacturer to the contractors, help support sweatshops by charging excessively high rates for shipping the goods. And it is virtually impossible for contractors to switch to another trucking concern because of the influence of organized crime, according to Senator Leichter. **********To clamp down on sweatshops, Senator Leichter this week is offering legislation that would compel contractors to register with the state. Under the measure, the state would be able to confiscate goods found in sweatshops - a practice that would adversely affect manufacturers who own the goods. **********''The manufacturers may become our policemen,'' said James Quillin, Labor Commissioner of California, where a similar law is scheduled to go into effect this July. **********Most New York manufacturers oppose the measure. ''All the laws that we need are already on the books,'' said Kurt Barnard, executive director of the Federation of Apparel Manufacturers. ''They should be enforced.'' **********Other measures cited as means of stopping sweatshops include making it a crime knowingly to employ illegal aliens, and granting amnesty - and legalization of their status - to illegal immigrants already working here. **********The outlook for any legislation is uncertain, however. A similar bill proposed by Senator Leichter failed to pass last year, and laws concerning immigrants require Federal action. **********Some manufacturers and government representatives tend to be blase about the need for such laws. As one manufacturer noted, ''Why should we object to employing people in sweatshops here when we're willing to import garments from sweatshops in Hong Kong and other countries?'' **********But Mr. DiArchangel rejects that. ''Legal or not,'' he said of the workers, ''they're here and they're working and we should be protecting them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/14/business/patents-a-system-to-control-office-entry.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1981-03-14", "snippet": "A CRYPTOGRAPHIC system that keeps unauthorized persons from entering offices, plants and hotels was patented this week by a staff mathematician for the International Business Machines Corporation.\n\nRoy L.

Boyar said somewhat immodestly the other day, ''in my 33d year as an insurance broker to the bright lights and to the stars.'' Since 1948, in fact, Mr. Boyar, who is 56, has made the slogan ''the show must go on'' a reality - more so than any producer, director, writer or even a star - as he busily arranges insurance (for all risks) for half the shows on Broadway, some productions elsewhere, plus a certain number of actors and actresses as well. **********In his small offices at 217 Broadway in lower Manhattan, Mr. Boyar wheels and deals with the top names in show business, mostly by phone, although ''sometimes I make house calls.'' It is often a 7 A.M. to 10 P.M. day for him -somewhat less for his wife Margery, his administrative aide, and his staff of 12. **********Mr. Boyar, who maintains that no other broker specializes to the extent he does in theatrical insurance, handled about $5 million in premiums last year, on which his agency received commissions of about 10 percent. He shares no risks with the underwriters, usually in his case the Chubb insurance group. **********His clients have included Liza Minnelli, Tom Conti, Henry Fonda, Rex Harrison, Bob Fosse, Sandy Duncan and Claudette Colbert, among others. Top shows he has known include ''Grease,'' ''Gemini,'' ''Peter Pan,'' ''Death Trap,'' ''Dancin','' ''Sophisticated Ladies'' and ''The Little Foxes.'' For Foxes, Mr. Boyar arranged coverage by Lloyd's of London, which will be shelling out about $200,000 to the producers because Elizabeth Taylor missed eight performances recently. **********Basically Mr. Boyar insures against business interruption, the sort of things that happened when Henry Fonda had a heart attack in the middle of the run of ''Darrow,'' Bette Davis's nerves overcame her during rehearsals for ''Miss Moffat,'' George C. Scott contracted the flu during ''Sly Fox'' and had to drop out and Gertrude Lawrence died while starring in ''The King and I.'' All were covered by theatrical insurance. Mr. Boyar said Zero Mostel was not insured when he died unexpectedly after one preview performance of ''The Merchant.'') **********Since cost of policies can sometimes deter prospects, Mr. Boyar often recommends a one- or two-performance deductible. This discourages the tempermental star from goofing off for a couple of days. **********In the last years, Mr. Boyar has gone beyond simple business interruption, designing a new, all-risk policy for theatrical productions with Chubb. This policy covers property and scenery against theft and damage, as well as the personal possessions of actors and production staffs and wardrobe. (The policy includes the extra-expense coverage that guards against business interruption.) **********''Scenery for a musical, any musical is elaborate, all custommade,'' he said. ''You can't just go back to the store and repurchase it. And the electronic control boards, which most shows rent today, are worth in excess of $100,000 alone.'' **********To illustrate his all-risks theme, Mr. Boyar referred to the recent revival of ''Brigadoon'' in Washington, where it was at the National Theater prior to its New York run. Cracks developed in the theater's walls, and the producers wanted to know if their policy covered structural damages including alterations. The answer was no. The cracks proved not to be dangerous and the show did go on, but Mr.  Boyar's new all-risk policy takes care of this. **********''For the first nine years of my career, I was associated with another broker,'' Mr. Boyar said. ''But I soon found out that I could best work alone in this very specialized, very personalized aspect of the insurance business.'' **********''Actually there are just three or four cities in North America, where my type of insurance is a practicality - is in real demand - and they are New York, Los Angeles, Toronto and, sometimes, Chicago,'' he said. ''And we can go anywhere,'' explaining that ''Turn to the Right'' a show at the Westwood Playhouse in Los Angeles, was recently insured by him, as were West Coast productions of ''Camelot.'' He also insures the St. Nicholas Theater in Chicago on a regular basis. **********While Chubb is his major partner in the game, it is Lloyd's of London, he said, that comes into play when other carriers balk.  ''This is usually the case with actors or actresses who have a history of illness or other problems,'' he said. **********The payoff can come in handy indeed. The Elizabeth Taylor policy for $2 million - a record for a single actor or actress in a play - cost her producers a premium of $105,000 for seven months, well covered by the $200,000 award. (''It was a very fair settlement,'' said a spokesman for Foxes producer Zev Bufman.) When Liza Minnelli developed the flu on Broadway several years ago, her producers got $270,000 on a premium of $10,000. **********The ANTA, Eugene O'Neill and the Theater De Lys are all insured by Mr. Boyar for all risks, he said, adding that he had also represented cable television and film productions as well. **********''M Y business is in the performing arts, but 90 percent of it is in the theater,'' he said. ''We do go after business, but for the most part the producers come to us.'' **********Although the $2 million figure on Miss Taylor is the highest sum insured for any individual stage actor or actress, larger sums are written for shows and various performances, particularly musicals, and they are usually notated on a per-performance-lost basis, around $25,000 a performance for ''The Little Foxes.'' Other coverage has been $800,000 for theatrical property and $350,000 in extra expenses for ''Peter Pan,'' $900,000 and $350,000, respectively, for ''Camelot'' and $860,000 and $300,000 for ''My Fair Lady.'' **********What do premiums cost? Mr. Boyar calculates that a premium for a conventional drama might run between $4,000 and $10,000 a year, and for something like the fast-moving ''Dancin' '' about $800 a week.  Coverage for stars can be as little as $2,500, but Rex Harrison's premium in the upcoming revival of ''My Fair Lady'' will be $100,000 a year. **********Mr. Boyar's father was the late Ben A. Boyar, theatrical manager for Max Gordon, who produced many famous Broadway shows in the 20's, 30's and 40's. When Ben Boyar turned to his son, who loved the wandering theatrical life, too, and advised him to go into a legitimate business, Robert Boyar chose theatrical insurance. **********''Very early on we offered financial protection for shows' loss and damage as they traveled from point to point in the country,'' Mr.  Boyar said. ''We then developed our business-interruption policy and then our all-risk policy, and they work like a charm.'' **********A favorite story of Mr. Boyar's concerns a road show leaving Los Angeles, when suddenly the truck in which sets and drops were being moved caught fire. ''They were totally destroyed, but a $160,000 claim was paid. This meant that show was indeed able to go on.  Without the insurance, the troupe would not have been able to make it back to New York.'' **********Perhaps the most unusual theater insurance story Mr. Boyar has to tell is that of Algernon, a trained theater mouse who was scheduled to open last fall in a Broadway musical. He was asked to quote on providing coverage on an understudy mouse since the theater company felt it wouldn't have time in which to train more than two mice. **********Taking matters seriously, Mr. Boyar went straight to his broker at Lloyd's, got the quote and went back to the producers with a $12,500 per performance lost policy. After guffaws from both sides of the Atlantic, the producers decided to simply train more mice as understudies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/14/business/coca-cola-prediction.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Coca Cola Prediction", "print_headline": "Coca Cola Prediction", "body_text": " **********First-quarter operating and net income for the Coca-Cola Company will likely be 6 percent to 10 percent above 1980 levels, the company said. **********The projected rise is the result of higher profits per unit and better management, the Atlanta-based company said in a release."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/13/business/credit-markets-money-supply-off-2.9-billion.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1981-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 897, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Credit Markets; MONEY SUPPLY OFF $2.9 BILLION", "print_headline": "Credit Markets; MONEY SUPPLY OFF $2.9 BILLION", "body_text": " **********The Federal Reserve announced yesterday afternoon that the nation's basic money supply dropped by $2.9 billion in the week ended June 3.  The decline was larger than analysts had expected and set off a sharp drop in interest rates. **********''I think we are very near a point where the Fed can relax its policy and let short-term interest rates drop by perhaps a few percentage points over the next two weeks,'' said Al Gross, an economist at Refco Partners, which trades in Government securities. **********He said that ''the Fed's willingness to keep rates very high for an extended period - about six weeks now - means that the economy should continue to weaken, and slow money growth will continue as the public's demand for money continues weak.'' **********Treasury bill rates fell more than three-eighths of a percentage point in late trading, with three- and six-month issues quoted at 14.12 percent and 13.62 percent, respectively. Long-term bond yields also fell. The bellwether 13 7/8 percent Treasury issue due in 2011 was offered at 109 15/32 to yield 12.62 percent, up more than 1 1/2 points, or $15 per bond, in less than an hour. M-1B at $424.6 Billion **********The closely watched M-1B measure of money supply, consisting of currency plus interest- and noninterest-bearing demand deposits at banks and savings institutions, declined $2.9 billion in the week, to $424.6 billion. Combined with a drop during May of $1.8 billion, the basic M-1B measure has declined at an annual rate of 8.2 percent over the latest reporting month, although it has grown at an annual rate of 6.8 percent over the latest statistical quarter. The Federal Reserve's maximum 1981 growth target for this key measure of money is 8.5 percent. **********The drop in money supply during May and early June came after rapid growth during April, when M-1B expanded by $6.6 billion, to an average of $429.5 billion. That rapid growth had caused the Fed to make bank reserves scarcer and pushed up interest rates so that three-month Treasury bills traded with rates as high as 17 percent in the first half of May. **********Securities traders reasoned that the money supply decline in recent weeks hastened the day when the Fed will encourage, or at least allow, interest rates to decline. An extended period of slow money supply growth means that banks need fewer reserves on deposit and therefore do not have as much need to borrow at high interest rates to obtain the reserves necessary to satisfy Fed requirements. **********According to monetary policy makers, the Fed is paying closer attention to M-1B after subtracting deposits that have been shifted from savings accounts. By that measure, money supply growth has been slower than the total M-1B number would indicate. **********The latest Fed data for May show that M-1B included about $9 billion of money once held in savings accounts, so that the adjusted level for M-1B was only $418.7 billion for May. That level is $500 million less than the $419.2 billion that would be consistent with the Fed's 5 1/2 percent annual growth rate target for the Marchthrough-June period. **********Fed officials are on record as saying they will pay closer attention to growth of M-2, a broader money supply measure. M-2, consisting of M-1B plus some short-term bank borrowings in the domestic and Eurodollar markets, money market mutual funds and savings deposits, averaged $1,741.7 billion in May, below the $1,746.9 billion level that would be consistent with the Fed's March-June growth target of 10 1/2 percent. **********Despite the Fed's stated intention of emphasizing M-2, many analysts have doubts about such a policy. Charles Lieberman, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, asked: ''Why should they emphasize a monetary aggregate over which they have little control?'' **********Along with many other analysts, Mr. Lieberman said that growth of money market mututal funds, which the Fed said totaled $118.4 billion on June 3, was ''largely outside the control of the Fed.'' In fact, analysts explain that when the Fed tries to reduce money supply growth by making bank reserves scarcer, the resulting high interest rates actually tend to increase growth of the money market funds. **********Other data published weekly by the Fed showed that the central bank was continuing to prevent expansion of banks' reserves. Reserves are the building blocks for future money supply growth, so slow or negative reserve growth now is another reason for expecting modest money growth in the future. **********Nonborrowed reserves declined $693 million in the week ended Wednesday, to $37.76 billion, and have contracted at an annual rate of 5.5 percent over the latest quarter. The Fed kept reserves scarce enough so that banks and others were forced to borrow an average of $2.2 billion at the discount window in the week to Wednesday. **********While slow growth and declines in monetary aggregates seem to point toward lower rates soon, Fed data showed that business credit demands continued robust. That worries some analysts, who say that a significant rate decline is not likely as long as credit demands are strong. **********Fed data showed that business loans extended by banks rose $1.17 billion in the week ended June 3, while nonfinancial companies raised an additional $1.29 billion of credit in the commercial paper market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/17/business/business-digest-thursday-december-17-1981-international.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 697, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1981; International", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST; THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1981; International", "body_text": " **********Poland indicated it cannot meet a pledge to pay $500 million by year-end in overdue interest owed to foreign banks.

Her problem was not medical but political, in the form of what are known in South Africa as banning orders. **********Banning orders make it a crime for their recipients to speak at any kind of gathering - usually even of three persons - or ever to be quoted in print. **********Mrs. Sisulu's banning orders lasted for 17 years, and were coupled with severe restrictions on her movements, even within this black township outside Johannesburg. Now she would like to tell her husband and the youngest of her three sons that she is able to speak out again on political issues, but they are in jail. **********Her husband is Walter Sisulu, a former secretary general of the outlawed African National Congress, who has been serving a life sentence on Robben Island, off Cape Town, since 1964. The two were married 37 years ago. Mrs. Sisulu, a nurse at a government clinic here, calculates that she and her husband, who will be 70 years old next year, have had a total of perhaps four or five years of normal family life. No Chance for Home Life **********Even before his last arrest, when he was not in jail or in hiding, her husband was usually on trial or under various forms of restrictions that interfered with his home life as well as his political activities. **********Her youngest son, Zwelakhe, has been detained for more than two months under the Terrorism Act, which relieves the authorities of any responsibility to draw up charges against him, allow him access to a lawyer or a relative, or even to disclose where he is being held. **********Mrs. Sisulu and her daughter-in-law, Zodwa, with whom she lives, have been making regular deliveries of clothing for Zwelakhe to the local headquarters of the security police. The fact that these were accepted was a kind of encouragement, until the other day when all the clothes were returned to her home without explanation. **********Five months before his arrest, Zwelakhe Sisulu, who is 31 years old, received a severe banning order that forced him to give up his job as a news editor on a black newspaper as well as his position as the outspoken leader of a union of black journalists called the Media Workers Association of South Africa. The paper for which he worked was then banned too. Awkward Situation Created **********South African law makes it a crime for two banned persons to meet or speak. This was awkward since mother and son were living in the same building, a small four-room brick bungalow that Walter Sisulu first occupied in 1940. **********Despite their banning orders, Mrs. Sisulu and her son went on meeting and speaking. ''I said, 'Nonsense,' '' she recalled, '' 'they must come and arrest us.' '' Instead, a security policeman showed up one day with an officially stamped authorization permitting mother and son to speak. ''We didn't apply for it,'' she said, laughing. **********She last visited Robben Island in January, but she is fairly confident that her husband must know by now about the lifting of her ban. She wrote him, but she cannot be sure that the letter went through uncensored.  As for Zwelakhe, she thinks there is little or no chance that he knows what is happening outside his prison, wherever it is. **********''We know he is going to be inside for a long time,'' she said.  ''We only wish they would tell us where he is.'' 1956 Protest Commemorated **********Despite the risk of provoking a new ban, it was only a week after the expiration of her old one that Mrs. Sisulu made her first political speech in nearly two decades. The occasion was a meeting at a local church to mark the 25th anniversary of a mass protest of black women against the requirement, then being introduced, that they carry passbooks when they were in areas deemed to be ''white.'' **********Mrs. Sisulu had been a leader of the protest that was being commemorated. ''It felt so good to be among people and to speak to the people,'' she said. ''I spoke about the role of women.

Mr. Soley also repeated what has become the opposition's prevailing view on the riots when he declared, ''Nobody is going to condone looting and rioting, but we have to understand there are deeper causes which cannot be dealt with simply by a heavy handed clampdown.'' **********Essentially, it is the view of the opposition that the riots reflect social discontent and frustration that have grown as unemployment has increased and as spending on social programs has shrunk in accordance with the Government's anti-inflationary policies. The position of the Government defenders is that the disorders are largely the result of a growing indiscipline of the family and the community. **********In Parliament this afternoon, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reported that the top law officers in the Cabinet were conducting an urgent review of laws and procedures affecting riot control. She said that plastic bullets would be made available to police in the current emergency. Mrs. Thatcher said that other details would be formally outlined in what she described as a major speech that the Home Secretary would make on Thursday when debate on the riots is scheduled in the House of Commons. **********Meanwhile, representatives of the 43 police commands in England and Wales are to meet here tomorrow to discuss antiriot tactics and possible new equipment and strategy. Until now, the police have been unobtrusive and have avoided confrontations and sweeps that might incite further violence. At the moment, police officials are considering the use of so-called ''snatch squads'' whose members, both in uniform and in plain clothes, rush into mobs to arrest suspects. Talks in Belfast **********According to press reports, a delegation of top British police officials was to leave tomorrow for Belfast for discussions with riot control experts in the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which for 12 years has sought to cope with fire bombs and rampaging youths. The visiting police officials will reportedly be shown the group's antiriot arsenal and be briefed on its tactics. **********Among the weapons being considered for use are water cannon, which project high pressure sprays to dispel crowds. Such equipment, which has been used effectively in France, was tested in Ulster but was found ineffective for conditions there. Plastic bullets, which like tear gas can now be employed at the discretion of police commanders, are nonlethal ammunition used in many parts of the world to scatter mobs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/15/world/from-new-delhi-to-iowa-indignation-and-prayers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 835, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FROM NEW DELHI TO IOWA, INDIGNATION AND PRAYERS", "print_headline": "FROM NEW DELHI TO IOWA, INDIGNATION AND PRAYERS", "body_text": " **********Around the world, political and religious leaders and ordinary people continued yesterday to pray for a speedy recovery for Pope John Paul II and express concern about the attempt on his life. **********In Bonn, the West German Parliament paused for a moment of silence on behalf of the Pope. In Moscow, Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, said he was ''profoundly indignant'' over the assassination attempt. In New Delhi, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said she was ''too shocked for words.'' **********In a message to the Pope from Beirut, Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said he deplored ''this abominable, criminal attempt on your precious life.'' **********Bulent Ulusu, the Turkish Prime Minister, said he condemned ''this terrible act with all my heart,'' but made no comment about Mehmet Ali Agca, the 23-year-old Turk being held as a suspect by the police in Rome.

Early yesterday afternoon in Manhattan, diplomats from dozens of countries gathered to pray for the Pope in a special mass at the Roman Catholic chapel that serves the United Nations. In the evening, a dozen Harlem ministers held a candlelight service in the open-air pavilion at the Harlem State Office Building at 125th Street and Seventh Avenue. **********Across the nation, churches were crowded with people responding to the attack in Rome, and in many schools children were making get-well cards for the Pope. **********Nearly the entire congregration turned out at St. Patrick's Church in the tiny Iowa farm town of Cumming, which John Paul visited when he was in the United States in 1979. 'A More Personal Feeling' **********''The Pope, to these people, isn't just somebody they've seen on TV,'' said the Rev. John Richter, who celebrated the mass for the Pope in the 113-year-old white frame church. **********''He's somebody you've met,'' Father Richter continued. ''It gives you a more personal feeling.'' John Connor, who farms just across the street from the Cumming church, said of the service: ''There were lots of special words.  He's more than just our Holy Father. He walked with us and visited with us.'' **********In Poland, the Pope's native country, hundreds of thousands filed into churches to pray not only for John Paul, but for the Polish primate, Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski, who is 79 years old and gravely ill. Theaters Close in Poland **********The crowd at St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw's old section overflowed into the cobbled streets for a block on both sides of the entrance. Many worshipers wept. Those outside the church knelt in the street. **********All the cinemas, theaters, nightclubs and cabarets in Poland were closed. State radio and television had subdued programming and gave extensive coverage to the details of the assassination attempt. **********At the United Nations service at the Holy Family Roman Catholic Church on East 47th Street, Secretary General Kurt Waldheim said: ''We were all deeply moved by this tragedy. At the United Nations it is our duty to do all we can to combat this kind of violence.'' **********Asked what could be done, Mr. Waldheim said, ''Pray for a speedy recovery.'' 'The Turks Are Doubly Shocked' **********Sitting in the last pew was Altemur Kilic, deputy representative of Turkey at the United Nations. ''The Turks are doubly shocked,'' he said. ''We don't consider the man who shot the Holy Father a Turk.  He is a demented lunatic. Yes, he is a citizen but we don't consider him a Turk.'' **********Communists and capitalists, Buddhists and Jews, ambassadors and maintenance workers, came from the nearby United Nations building to fill the church. **********Many privately expressed dismay and anger at the prevalence of such violence in their countries. But Archbishop Giovanni Cheli, the personal representative of the Pope at the United Nations, told the congregation that the shooting was another ''episode in the old battle between hate and love'' and that to show hatred for the man who shot the Pope would be unfaithul to the Pope's teachings. **********''Let us lift our hearts in praise of God that the Pope continues with us in this struggle of love over evil,'' Archbishop Cheli said. Visit of Pope Paul VI Recalled **********A few in the audience said they remembered when Pope Paul VI came to this church in 1965 to proclaim the United Nations ''the last hope of peace.'' Virtually all remembered warmly the visit of Pope John Paul II to the United Nations, in 1979, as an uplifitng experience that ''reminded us all of why we were here,'' as one in the audience put it. **********During the mass, members of the congregation shook hands with their neighbors and said, ''Peace be with you.''

And the Congress, which voted $6 billion more than President Carter asked for last year, is already charged up to do its part in expanding the defense budget. The question, then, is not whether, but by how much, the budget will swell. **********The consequences for the taxpayer and the economy in general will be mixed at best, but for businesses large and small, the prospective increases mean a surge in sales. **********About $55 billion of the Carter budget, up from $45 billion this year, will be allotted to procurement. President-elect Ronald Reagan's nominee to be Secretary of Defense, Caspar W. Weinberger, said during his confirmation hearing last week that shipbuilding would be increased, which is likely to mean more income for the likes of Litton Industries, the Newport News Shipbuilding subsidiary of Tenneco, and Electric Boat of General Dynamics. **********The expanding hardware sales could also mean more F-14 Tomcat fighters from Grumman on Long Island, more Blackhawk helicopters from United Technologies' Sikorsky operations in Connecticut, and more XM-1 Abrams tanks from Chrysler in Ohio. The Republicans have said they want a new long-range bomber to replace the aging B-52's and the B-1 that Mr. Carter killed early in his Presidency. That could mean lucrative contracts for Boeing or the North American division of Rockwell, both on the West Coast. **********There is much more, however, than big benefits to a few large companies. Less glamorous items covered in the budget under ''operations and maintenance'' may be going up faster than hardware.  More than $60 billion will be requested for more fuel for planes, trucks and ships plus everything from grease to paint to bullets to socks and boots - good news for hundreds of smaller, local companies scattered across the landscape. **********Then too, Mr. Weinberger and other Republicans have suggested pay increases to induce men and women to stay in the Armed Forces, as well as restoring the G.I. Bill of Educational Benefits. That could mean more spending by military personnel in communities near bases from Norfolk to San Diego, from Mountain Home, Idaho, to El Paso, Tex. - and more students and income for increasingly hard-pressed universities. **********I N all of the outcry for more spending, most people simply talk of overall increases, like the 14.5 percent rise indicated by the final Carter budget. Only a few have held up hands of caution. **********Some point out that, since Vietnam, the United States has lacked a cohesive military strategy to govern the expenditure of military funds. Instead, Americans have argued over the draft, the state of military readiness, and the basing of the mobile missile called ''MX.'' That, say the critics, leads to spending money without knowing precisely why it is being spent. **********''This frantic game of bidding up percentage points is a deeply flawed analysis of needs,'' said Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie last winter, when he was chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.  ''In fact, it is no analysis at all. We must begin to solve our military problems by asking the right questions - questions about the ends we want to achieve and the means required to achieve them,'' he continued. ''Beware of the practitioner of statecraft who designs his policies on a calculator.'' **********''More funds will provide a better defense only if the money is spent for the right things,'' added Senator Gary Hart, Democrat of Colorado, who has won a widening reputation as a thoughtful critic of the nation's defense policies. **********A few organizations, such as the Center for Defense Information led by retired Rear Adm. Gene R. LaRocque, or the Boston Study Group, an informal association of scholars, have argued that the expenditures aren't necessary and detract from pressing social or economic needs. **********Moreover, Mr. Reagan and his close advisers have still not convincingly shown that they can jack up military spending, cut taxes, and balance the national budget within the relatively short space of four years - and get inflation under control. **********But those objections seem to have been brushed aside. The advocates of a great leap upward in military spending point to more than a decade of expansion of Soviet military power. They point out that that the Soviet Union was modernizing its military forces while the United States was spending billions of dollars to conduct the Vietnam war. The net result: the Soviet Union has plenty of weapons to show for its expenditures; the United States tons of arms in the jungles of Indochina. **********Then too, they argue that defense spending, as a part of the gross national product, has room to grow. For the 15 years of peace and war from 1956 through 1970, for example, national defense consumed an average of 8.3 percent of G.N.P. Since then, it has declined steadily each year, to 5.2 percent in both 1979 and 1980. The prospect today is for a sustained growth toward 6 percent. **********The reasons that defense costs so much, however, are more complicated than that. They range from the fundamental way that Americans have chosen to defend themselves, to a variety of domestic political motives, weaknesses in the nation's industrial structure, and military waste. Beyond those factors are the failure of allies to pick up a proportionate share of the financial burden, and general economic elements such as inflation.Fundamental Posture **********U NITED STATES ARMED FORCES cost more than they otherwise might because Americans have chosen to defend themselves as far from their own shores as possible. In each of World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the war in Vietnam, American forces moved farther away, across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that Americans have always perceived as two great moats protecting the country. Only the nuclear deterrent remains based primarily within the United States. **********It's an expensive approach. To airlift and supply a lightly-armed combat force of only 625 men to Egypt in the recent ''bright star'' exercise of the new rapid deployment force cost $25 million for less than two weeks - about $40,000 a man. In contrast, the Soviet Union since World War II has sent forces to Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, all of which are, literally, a truck ride away. **********Moreover, Americans have elected to spend treasure rather than blood in defense, relying increasingly on advanced - and expensive - technology. An F-15 fighter from McDonell Douglas is priced at $17 million a copy; each of Chrysler's new XM-1 tanks costs $1 million; the Aegis cruisers under construction by Litton's Ingalls subsidiary will cost close to $1 billion apiece. Perhaps most stunning, one round, meaning one piece of ammunition, for a standard antitank gun costs $5,000. One shot of an air-to-air missile can cost more than most men will earn in a lifetime. **********Then too, there has been palpable evidence of ''gold-plating'' to get the last 10 percent of performance out of a weapon, regardless of cost. Maintenance of high-performance planes, tanks and ships also costs more. **********By contrast, the Soviet Union makes more, simpler and cheaper weapons but maintains a military force twice the size of that of the United States, with a willingness to suffer much higher casualties. **********Intelligence gathering is also costly for the United States because the Soviet Union and other potential adversaries are closed societies. That means relying on expensive satellites for photographs and sensors, on an elaborate network of electronic listening devices, on a variety of high-priced reconnaissance planes and ships. **********The Soviet Union, again by contrast, can learn most of what it wants to know about the West by subscribing to an abundance of military, industrial and other specialized journals and to the general press.Political Impetus **********E XPENDITURES for military forces, whether well conceived or not, have become a banner to display national determination. ''The military budget is no longer a component of foreign policy - it is its very symbol,'' as Robert J. Bresler, a political scientist at Penn State, has said. Thus, Secretary Muskie has had plenty of company among both Democrats and Republicans in calling for strategy before spending. But so far that appears to have fallen on deaf ears. **********Then too, according to Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, perhaps $5 billion a year could be cut from the military budget if Congressmen voted for the national interests rather than the economic interests of their districts. **********A classic example was the $112.6 million voted last year for six A-7 attack planes for the Air National Guard that the Pentagon didn't ask for and tried to kill after the House put them into the bill. But the delegation from Texas, where the planes are built by Vought, insisted and got its way. In comparison, the 60 Fairchild Republic A-10 aircraft requested and received for the active Air Force were budgeted at just $452.6 million. **********In another case, the Defense Department wanted to close Fort Dix in New Jersey and to consolidate its functions elsewhere to save money.  But officials in New Jersey and New York were successful in blocking the closure. Mr. Reagan is no stranger to that game. California, the state of which he was once Governor, is by far the largest recipient of military dollars, receiving $12.3 billion in 1979. **********All over the country, then, defense contractors are rubbing their hands in the expectation of a bonanza. Their lobbyists here can be expected to begin a full court press as soon as the new administration takes office - all in the interest of what's best for the XYZ gunmaker, and its community.Industrial Weaknesses **********P ICK up any newspaper or news magazine these days and the chances are good it will contain a report on a military cost overrun, a delay in deliveries, a case of faulty workmanship. **********Recently, for instance, General Dynamics's Electric Boat Company in Groton, Conn., was publicly flogged because of delays in delivering its first Trident ballistic missile submarine. A subcontractor had failed to deliver steel that fit specifications, inadequately trained workers did poor welding, and technicians installed pipes and valves improperly. Also, Chrysler reported that it has fallen behind in delivering the new XM-1 tank because the subcontractor failed to deliver engines on time. **********Much of the high and rising cost of weapons in military equipment is rooted in the same industrial weaknesses that cause high and rising costs in civilian products: outdated manufacturing facilities, low productivity, inadequate quality control, and poor workmanship. **********But peculiar to the defense industry is the practice of using the same contractor both to design and produce a weapon. That leads, according to Congressional investigators, to designers rendering optimistic reports on developmental progress so that a production contract will result. **********Jacques S. Gansler, a former senior official in the Defense Department, contends in a new book, ''The Defense Industry,'' that the nation's economic system has failed to foster an efficient defense industry. He suggests that $3 billion a year could be saved by revitalizing that industry. **********Defense industrialists complain that Government overregulation hinders them even more than civilian industry and thus drives up the cost of arms. A fear of mistakes in research and development has fostered layer on layer of review boards that slow down the process and raise costs. **********The procurement policies of the Government, many of which are set by Congress, are a particular target of criticism. Stretching out orders over several years - ostensibly to keep down the military budget - only precludes economies of scale and causes higher per unit costs. Defense contractors further complain that repeated changes in design, mandated by the military, drive up prices. **********In addition, the practice of single-year budgets, defense contractors say, makes it difficult for them to operate efficiently.  In a recent year-end report, Karl G. Harr, president of the Aerospace Industries Association, asserted that 10 to 30 percent could be saved through contracts that covered several years. **********Edward Hidalgo, the Secretary of the Navy, has vigorously argued that the costly adversarial relationship between the Government and industry must end. ''Either Government and business devise and execute an appropriate plan for cooperative coexistence or they will find themselves increasingly divided and conquered,'' he said.Military Waste **********''T HE Pentagon,'' says a Congressional student of the Defense Department, ''is the world's largest nonprofit organization.'' He and others contend that Pentagon officials, from top to middle management, have little incentive to save money. If they do, Congress will only take it back and cut their budgets the next year, and their personal careers will suffer. **********If an officer saves money on one weapon or program, there is practically no way that his service can use that money elsewhere for more ammunition, extra equipment, or an additional training exercise. So the drive is to get as much as possible for each category of spending. **********That puts the military services into intense competition with each other. Inter-service rivalry has been curbed in recent years by the increasingly centralized budget-making process and the Pentagon under the watchful eye of the Office of Management and Budget in the White House. But it is still there. **********In a bureaucracy as large as the military establishment - covering 3 million uniformed and civilian people - waste seems inevitable. An estimated $3 billion a year is spent just on moving people from one station to another. **********Secretary of Defense Harold Brown said in an interview last summer that he had struggled for nearly four years against inefficiency and waste in his department and thought maybe he had saved $1.5 billion in his best year. But he was clearly dissatisfied with his inability to overcome bureaucratic resistance. ''One man's waste,'' he sighed, ''is another man's job.'' **********The cost of the volunteer army has been coming under increasing scrutiny, without much evidence that a draft army would be much cheaper. Secretary Brown says that it costs the United States $15,000 a year on an average for each soldier while West Germany, with its drafted army, pays $14,000. But General Edward C. Meyer, the Army Chief of Staff, has contended that the nation must pay more if it is to make the volunteer army work. It is he who has urged a return to G.I. Bill of Educational Benefits and a substantial pay increase for senior sergeants and specialists to keep them in the service.Thrifty Allies **********T HE failure of Western Europe and Japan to carry a proportionate share of the Western world's defense burden is a clear source of irritation in the United States. As a rough guide, while the United States has been spending its 5 percent and more of G.N.P. on defense, the 13 allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization spend an average of 3.5 percent. Britain alone, at 4.8 percent, approaches the United States. Japan spends slightly less than 1 percent. **********The Carter Administration succeeded in extracting a pledge from the NATO allies that each would increase military spending 3 percent a year, after the effects of inflation (compared with the 4.5 percent real growth implied in the expected Carter budget). But few have done so. **********''No American Government, and still less the American people or the American Congress,'' Defense Secretary Brown has warned, ''are going to accept a situation in which some other country feels that it's our job to defend them and they needn't bother to defend themselves.'' **********The slow pace of standardizing weapons and equipment to reduce duplication is also a thorn. Professor Bresler wrote: ''Alliance leaders collectively wring their hands about growing Soviet might, yet none of them is prepared to lose a dollar or a franc or a deutschemark in defense contracts, or take the political cost of closing factories or laying workers off in order to improve the Alliance's efficiency.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/15/business/matrix-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 49, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MATRIX CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "print_headline": "MATRIX CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/25/business/sfe-technologies-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SFE TECHNOLOGIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "print_headline": "SFE TECHNOLOGIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/30/business/airlines-state-merger-issues.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 191, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AIRLINES STATE MERGER ISSUES", "print_headline": "AIRLINES STATE MERGER ISSUES", "body_text": " **********Continental Air Lines said today its acquisition by Texas International Airlines would create a weak, debt-ridden carrier and would reduce air service, especially in the South Pacific areas now serviced by Continental. **********But Texas International, which holds 48.5 percent of Continental's stock, said the airlines could be profitable under common management with no significant loss of service. **********The arguments were made before the Civil Aeronautics Board, which must decide by the end of August whether to approve the acquisition.

''First they attack us for making it too harsh. When we amend it, they say it is ineffectual.'' **********The wealth tax, which began last week as one of the big symbolic spearheads of the Socialist battle to create a more egalitarian economic system, has come out the size of a penknife. **********President Francois Mitterrand, whose twin passions for the arts and for Socialism had never up to this point conflicted, decided Thursday night to eliminate paintings, sculpture and antiquities from the list of things that will be considered taxable wealth under the new law. At the same time, it was indicated that stocks of wine and forest holdings would also be exempt. **********''Bravo, la France!'' the 94-year-old Marc Chagall telegraphed Mr.  Mitterrand at Elysee Palace. Painters, art collectors, gallery owners and auctioneers, who had been predicting that Paris - after the expected clandestine flight of canvases and statues - would rapidly achieve the artistic standing of Pinsk, expressed great relief. Tax on Sales of Art **********Instead of taxing the possession of art objects, the law will put a tax of up to 6 percent upon sales. In a booming art market this is unlikely to have much impact. Less clear was the impact of an amendment requiring that the wealth tax be exacted, retroactively to the passage of the law, when an art object is exported. The amendment was offered not by the Socialists but by former Prime Minister Michel Debre, a strongly nationalist member of the opposition. **********The wealth tax originally aimed at levying between one-half of 1 percent and 1.5 percent on personal holdings valued at more than $600,000 and on business holdings above $1 million. The law now has so many restrictions that it is expected to bring in only $1 billion a year, or less than 1 percent of Government revenues. **********For the Government, the shrinking of its wealth tax is, if not precisely a defeat, a reminder of the difficulties it faces in working out its program, and a source of some additional ones -mainly involving the cohesion of its own followers. **********In the National Assembly, the Socialist deputies loyally passed the Government proposals and warded off amendments that the Government opposed. A number of them had misgivings, however, notably Mr. Fabius himself, who, until last week, had argued strongly within the Cabinet against any further reduction of the tax. 'An Empty Sack' **********The Communists, who are minority partners in the Government and are expected to support it in the Assembly, came the closest they have been so far to opposing it. One Communist deputy called the law ''a sieve,'' and another said it was ''an empty sack.'' For the first time in the life of the current Assembly, Socialists found themselves -in partnership with the opposition - voting down Communist amendments seeking to strengthen the law. **********The difficulties over the wealth tax are essentially a struggle between two contradictory portions of the French Socialist soul.  The Socialists harbor simultaneous impulses to wield ideology for the sake of changing France, and pragmatism for the sake of gauging what France will accept. The wealth tax, while not unpopular in theory - even among businessmen it does not stand high on the worry list - became so when it began to touch particular concrete things that signify France to different groups of the French. It can be wine to some, grandfather's bit of oak forest to others, and art to still others - including the President. **********In recent weeks the friction between ideology and pragmatism, between the exercise of prudence and the wielding of power, has become more pronounced. Like any friction, it produces heat. Personnel Changes **********The wealth tax aside, the main source of heat is now a number of personnel changes that the Government has made. A high official in the Budget Ministry and another in the Labor Ministry were replaced.  They are both highly respected - so much so that even newspapers that support the Government have lamented their removal, suggesting that the only reason they were ousted is that they served under the previous Government. **********To which Government ministers have retorted that this is normal practice in a democratic system when the government changes, and that if France is not used to it, this is only because the same party had been in power for nearly a quarter of a century. **********Over the last few days the Government has encountered the most serious protest so far against its personnel shifts. This was the resignation of virtually the entire top echelon of France's major scientific research body, the National Center for Scientific Research. **********The Minister of Research and Technology, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, had requested that the center's director replace the head of the sociology department with a Marxist-oriented sociologist. The director general, Jacques Ducuing, resigned Thursday.  On Friday, Charles Thibault, president of the center, and five of the six scientists on the governing council resigned. Their protest was not over the identity of the new appointee but over the fact that the normal procedure, under which the center proposes its candidates to the Minister, had been flouted. **********''Even in the United States, which is supposed to be a model democracy, you have a spoils system,'' Mr. Chevenement said. It seems likely, judging by early comments here, that the more pragmatic members of the Government will find fault, if not with Mr.  Chevenement's argument, at least with his way of carrying it out."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/15/business/9-digit-zip-challenged.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 296, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "9-Digit ZIP Challenged", "print_headline": "9-Digit ZIP Challenged", "body_text": " **********The United States Postal Service's controversial nine-digit ZIP code, which has run into strong Congressional opposition, received another jolt today when the Office of Management and Budget ordered the service to justify its plan with a costbenefit analysis. **********While the budget office made the request for the regulatory impact analysis, it was understood that Congress and not the Reagan Administration would use the material provided to decide whether to allow the Postal Service to go through with its plan. **********Legislation has been introduced in both houses of Congress to prevent the new ZIP code from becoming effective June 1, as planned by the Postal Service. **********The letter was sent Friday by James C.

He described what it was like to be in the embassy on Sunday, Nov. 4, 1979, when the Iranian militants broke in. **********''I was working in the basement of one of the buildings in the compound,'' he said. ''Sunday is just another working day in the Islamic world. We could hear the crowd yelling and cheering. Then someone came in and told us we'd better move upstairs to a safer location. We barricaded ourselves in but it didn't make any difference. We had to let them in or they would have torn the whole place down. That first day was the closest I've ever come to total terror.'' **********Asked if he considered resisting or escaping, Mr. German replied, ''When there is a gun being cocked in your ear, you don't have many options.'' Would Return 'in a B-52' **********Mr. German, 44 years old, said he believed that the hostage crisis could make life difficult for other diplomats. ''There is just no way you can make an embassy safe from half a million angry people,'' he said. Mr. German added that he would never take a foreign post where new security measures, now being planned, were not in effect. As for Iran, he said he would return there - ''only in a B-52.'' **********''We had our moments of despair,'' he said. He insisted at first that there was ''very little bitterness'' among the former hostages.  Then he stopped and added in a subdued voice, ''I'd rather not get into that.'' **********Mr. German said that for him the captivity grew worse after the unsuccessful rescue attempt last April. ''We had good food at first,'' he said. ''We had the Ambassador's cook.'' After the aborted mission the hostages were dispersed. ''We were spread over the whole country,'' he said, ''from the cities to the smallest village.'' **********He said the hostages heard about the rescue attempt soon after it was over. ''We were against it,'' he said. ''We heard that Secretary Vance had resigned over it and we applauded that. After all, it came six months into it -what was the sense?'' Learned About Iran-Iraq War **********The hostages eventually learned about the Iraqi-Iranian war, although their captors at first denied that it was taking place, Mr.  German said. ''In September, when they imposed the blackout, they told us it was for a celebration,'' he said. ''We just hoped it was the Iraqis who were celebrating.'' **********Wearing the new Air Force parka he received on the flight from Algiers to West Germany on Wednesday morning, Mr. German grinned broadly and said, ''I'm thankful I'm still intact -physically and mentally.'' **********He gave further indication that the front shown by the hostages was not that solid. Asked repeatedly, ''How do you all feel?'' he became irritated. ''Look,'' he said, ''there were 52 of us. There are 52 different stories.'' He paused and added, ''Everyone was so isolated.'' **********Of the Iranian militants, he said: ''We were sympathetic to their cause at first - we thought their motives were sound. But they weren't students. They may have been students once. We all were. They were terrorists, pure and simple.'' **********Mr. German said that the stay in Wiesbaden had been beneficial.

Shad, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Restraining such abuses, he says, will be a top priority during his term in office. **********Mr. Shad, who did not elaborate on how the commission would deal with this problem, said that the agency's enforcement division would ''have some dramatic news that relates to the insider trading area'' this week. ''We're going to come down with hobnail boots to give some shocking examples to inhibit the activity.'' **********The commission chairman, in a meeting with a group of reporters and editors at The New York Times, touched on a broad range of topics affecting the economy and the securities industry, but he saved his strongest remarks for the problem of controlling insider trading abuses. **********Charges of insider trading - trading in stock on the basis of information not available to the public - have received widespread publicity in the last few weeks. The trading of stock options in Sante Fe International before the recent announcement that the Kuwaiti Government wanted to buy the oil drilling company has been under scrutiny. And a partner with the New York law firm of Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz was discharged in September after admitting that he had traded in stocks of several of the firm's client companies. Insider Trades Limited **********Despite these two instances, Mr. Shad cautioned against undermining investor confidence by exaggerating the amount of insider activity in the stock market. **********''It's definitely a major problem, and it requires a major assault by the S.E.C., the Bar and the industry - and that's what I'm trying to support,'' Mr. Shad said. ''But to suggest that the billions of dollars of securities that change hand daily in America are on insider trading is irrational - it's only a tiny fraction of 1 percent of the volume of trading.'' **********''I think it's wrong to suggest that the public is playing a game for which the dice is loaded against them,'' he said. ''To say that insider trading is the rule rather than the exception, that it's a common act, is just not true.'' **********Mr. Shad said he ''constantly'' has heard reports of poor morale in the enforcement division since the departure of Stanley Sporkin, who as head of the unit in the 1970's vigorously pursued hundreds of cases involving questionable payments by American corporations. **********But he said that the commission already has enough work that cannot be pursued and to suggest that the division has problems because it will no longer be able to investigate foreign bribes is unwarranted.  ''The problem is that we lack the resources,'' he said. Extent of S.E.C. Authority **********Mr. Shad emphasized that he supported the vigorous enforcement of the securities laws, but ''the question I'm raising is should they also be engaged in writing the law? Do we need to extend the authority of the S.E.C. to marginal questions?'' **********''In times past, within the enforcement division - and probably even today, there are people who want to move the cutting edge of the law -that are really going for greater authority in the commission, and I think that that should be a secondary issue.'' **********During his time in office, Mr. Shad said he would like the commission to focus on ''improving the capital formation process,'' which is investment in plant and equipment financed by profits, securities offerings and debt issues. **********Mr. Shad's ideas about capital formation by public corporations contrast sharply in some areas with the philosophy of his precedessor, Harold M. Williams. **********Mr. Williams, while encouraging the capital formation process, also raised questions during his tenure about whether corporate takeovers diverted credit and capital from more productive and innovative uses. **********In contrast, Mr. Shad said the trend toward mergers and the creation of financial service conglomerates is ''a natural extension of evolutionary developments in the securities industry, It's not bad. There are advantages of size, and I think the public will benefit and won't be hurt by these major mergers.'' Supports Disclosure Streamlining **********Before his appointment as commission chairman, Mr. Shad spent almost all of his working life on Wall Street, rising to vice chairman of the E.F. Hutton Group Inc., as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. **********Although the commission has limited jurisdiction over mergers, it does review the adequacy of disclosure statements filed with the agency in connection with acquisitions. Mr. Shad promised to simplify that process by reducing excessive registration, reporting and other regulatory burdens on the industry. ''The problem we have all the time in the commission is, what is the value of more disclosure? To what extent is more and more disclosure actually less significant to the public?'' he said. **********Mr. Shad, speaking about the national securities market that Congress mandated in 1975, said that the commission wanted the securities industry to develop a rule dealing with the potential problems of ''internalization,'' or execution of a customer order by a brokerage firm ''in house'' rather than on a stock exchange floor. **********The ability of larger brokerage firms to internalize orders has been viewed by exchanges as a competitive threat that could diminish orders on exchange floors. **********The commission has said that it was concerned about internalization, but it indicated the issue should not delay establishment of a national securities market. **********''The industry would like us to come up with a rule, and we said, we want you to come up with a rule, you're going to have to live with this,'' Mr. Shad said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/world/around-the-world-nicaragua-says-it-killed-14-pro-somoza-rebels.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Nicaragua Says It Killed 14 Pro-Somoza Rebels", "print_headline": "Around the World; Nicaragua Says It Killed 14 Pro-Somoza Rebels", "body_text": " **********Fourteen people were killed in the last week in clashes between Government soldiers and ''counterrevolutionary'' groups in northern Nicaragua, the Interior Ministry announced yesterday.

Instead, Dr. Ayari said, efforts are being made to revive the so-called Standing Commission consisting of members from the O.A.U. and the Arab League to discuss problems relating to the Arab-African situation. **********Black African leaders are voicing increasing concern that relations between their nations and the Arab world have deteriorated to a point where major political steps need to be taken to avert a crisis. **********At the heart of this ''crisis'' is a belief by many black African nations, particularly poorer ones such as Uganda, Kenya, Ghana and Zambia, that the oil-producing countries of the Arab world have long promised major infusions of financial aid as well as significant concessions in oil prices, but that these Arab nations simply have not come through adequately in meeting their pledges. Egyptian Presence Is Obstacle **********The Standing Commission has long been moribund. Moves to set up a working session for the unit have been stymied by the fact that Egypt is a member of the commission, and many Arab nations, opposed to the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, have refused to attend any meeting where Egyptian representatives would be present. **********Peter Onu, Assistant Secretary General of the African organization, insisted today that since Egypt was a legitimate member, it ''must be allowed to participate'' in the working sessions of the Standing Commission. Egypt was suspended from the Arab League in 1979 after it signed the peace treaty with Israel. **********However, the black African countries have pointed to their consistent support of the general Arab position concerning Middle East issues. Tonight they reached agreement on a new resolution, proposed by Egypt, that condemned the recent raid by Israel on a nuclear reactor in Iraq. The 1,200-word Egyptian resolution, calling the Israeli attack ''a flagrant violation'' of the United Nations Charter and international law, urges that the Israelis be ordered to allow international inspectors at its own nuclear reactor site. **********Whatever Egypt's isolation in the Arab world, it is apparent that President Anwar el-Sadat retains considerable popularity among African leaders. Many of these view Egypt as presenting a counter to a perceived adventurism of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Egypt Active in Black Africa **********Moreover, Egypt has long had an active foreign policy in black Africa, and it has sent teachers, technicians, physicians and military advisers to several black African countries. **********Several leaders of black African nations attending the O.A.U summit session said that Arab nations, especially the oil-producing countries, have not sufficiently helped poor black African countries that severed their relations with Israel at the urging of the Arab world. **********Some of these countries, like Uganda and Kenya, used to have major programs of technical assistance set up by the Israelis, particularly in agriculture and engineering. The black African leaders complain that although their countries provide the Arab world with often vocal support on the Palestine issue, by pursuing highprice policies the oil-producing Arabs have damaged the economies of the poor Africans. **********African leaders here assert that the volume of aid given by Arabs to black Africa - about $1 billion a year, according to Dr. Ayari - is simply not enough to overcome the fuel bills that they are increasingly being required to pay. Kenya, for example, is reported to spend nearly 75 percent of its budget on oil imports, or more than $800 million a year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/01/business/factory-orders-up-in-march.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 541, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FACTORY ORDERS UP IN MARCH", "print_headline": "FACTORY ORDERS UP IN MARCH", "body_text": " **********New orders for manufactured goods rose 1.3 percent in March, with modest increases coming in automotive equipment, construction materials and various kinds of machinery, the Commerce Department reported today. **********Most major durable-goods categories were relatively stable, with losses reported for household goods and primary metals.

Soon a rumor arose that a major oil and gas company would be making a bid for Great Basins. People on Wall Street believed the rumor and, guessing that the takeover price would be $25 to $30 a share, pushed the stock price to 24 1/4. **********However, when the Phillips Petroleum Company made a bid in March 1980, the United States-based company offered $18 a share in cash.  Great Basins promptly fell to 15 5/8, reflecting the disappointing price. The discount from that price had to do with the time cost of financing the purchase of shares on margin pending the consummation of the takeover deal and the uncertainties that such bids entail. **********In October, a major uncertainty materialized when the Canadian Government announced a new policy toward foreign takeovers. The Government's professed goal is to increase Canadian ownership of Canadian energy companies to 50 percent by the end of the decade, up from an average of 30 percent ownership held by Canadians today. **********The new policy makes Canadian acquisitions by United States companies difficult if not impossible in most cases. Great Basins shares promptly plummeted to 11 as investors speculated that Phillips might withdraw. It did the next month. **********Discouraged over the prospects of a merger, Great Basins then announced that the company would liqui-date. Thereafter, the shares rallied to trade as high as 15, but they have since drifted lower. **********Great Basins has already agreed to sell its oil and gas interests north of the border to Canadian-controlled United Canso Oil and Gas Ltd. for $154 million (Canadian) adjusted for repayment of debt, or $128.6 million (United States). This equals $12 a share. Great Basins has 10.7 million shares outstanding. **********Great Basins sold one small United States oil and gas property, and the remaining Canadian oil and gas properties are to be disposed of contingent upon stockholder approval, which is expected. These properties are to produce enough to retire the remaining Great Basins long-term debt. **********It may be that investors are overlooking the fact that Great Basins will have $12 a share in cash after all debt is liquidated. Anyway, one way of looking at this prospect, says Christopher Stavro, an analyst for Evans & Company who specializes in buying shares of companies that are being bought out or are liquidating, is that at yesterday's closing price, the investor would acquire the rest of the company free. **********The remaining assets are not spectacular, but they do amount to something. They include a 17.6 percent working interest in the Ladner Creek Gold Mine in British Columbia, currently being managed by Carolin Mines. Some believe that the Great Basins interest in that mine might eventually be worth a great deal more than $5 a share. On the other hand, Mr. Stavro believes the mine interest would bring $2.50 a share in liquidation. **********Great Basins also has 17 million tons of coal reserves in the Taggart and Harlan coal seams in Virginia that are said to be worth 25 cents to 50 cents a ton. At the midpoint, 37 cents a ton, the coal would be worth 60 cents a Great Basins share, Mr.Stavro said. **********Mr. Stavro's clients own approximately 10,000 shares of Great Basins stock, and he has placed a substantial number of shares with institutions. **********Clearly, the remaining assets are worth somewhat more than the price for which the shares are now selling. Mr. Stavro believes there is total value ranging from $15.50 to $18 a share, a substantial premium over the cash the company is to receive on the sale of its oil and gas interests."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/04/business/harvester-creditor-demands-payment.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Harvester Creditor Demands Payment", "print_headline": "Harvester Creditor Demands Payment", "body_text": " **********The International Harvester Company said one of its more than 200 creditor banks, the First National Bank of Commerce of New Orleans, had demanded payment of its $3.5 million loan and has filed suit in Federal court in New Orleans to recover the amount. **********Harvester said it would fight the suit and believed the bank's demand was inappropriate in view of the substantial progress made by the company toward completion of its refinancing program.

The public roared and applauded. To everyone's surprise Erich Honecker, the Communist Party leader, had announced shortly before that he would personally oversee preparations for observance of the 500th anniversary in 1983 of Luther's birth. **********Earlier this summer, East Germans witnessed the ceremonies for a new Protestant church and community center at Eisenhuttenstadt, a Communist-built industrial center, where religious services had been barred for nearly 30 years. At Potsdam last month, the war-damaged St. Nicholas Church was reconsecrated in the presence of Communist officials, Western diplomats and church leaders from East and West. **********''Our churches are experiencing a real construction boom,'' Klaus Gysi, the East German Secretary of State for Church Affairs, recently told a group of Western visitors.

He added that the church would abide by its independent role as a spiritual force. **********Most observers believe that the change in the official attitude reflects a desire to integrate the country's practicing Christians into East German society instead of letting them build up an opposition to the state. Originally the Communists in East Germany ignored or fought the churches, regarding them as superfluous or dangerous. **********Other officials said the new moves were aimed at winning over clergymen and believers for the East's anti-Western drive, in an attempt to influence West Germany through the close links that exist between the churches in the two Germanys. **********The Protestant Church, which with eight million members in a population of 17 million is the strongest religious group, has long opposed military indoctrination, especially the paramilitary training for boys and girls at the state-run primary and secondary schools. **********The Roman Catholic Church here, a relatively small group with 1.2 million members, has in general restricted itself to pastoral care, refraining from political involvement. But it too has profited from the new program, having just inaugurated a modern church and community center at the town of Neubrandenburg, north of Berlin. **********The new Protestant church at Eisenhuttenstadt, a city formerly known as Stalinstadt and founded in the early 1950's as a symbol of Communism, is seen as marking the most significant shift in official thinking.

This would mean a substantially higher tax loss to the Government than it initially believed. **********Commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations are competing vigorously in offering the new tax-exempt certificates, which come in denominations as low as $500. Many banks are adding staff or extending their hours, and heavy advertising campaigns are common. Credit unions also are offering the certificates. **********Each person who buys the one-year certificates, sometimes referred to as ''all-savers certificates,'' may exempt up to $1,000 of the interest from Federal income taxes. Married couples filing joint tax returns may exempt up to $2,000. **********Viewed as Tax Shelter **********''Many people see this as a tax shelter for the little guy, so there should be a lot of interest,'' said Oscar S. Pollock, a partner at Ingalls & Snyder, a brokerage firm. ''The revenue losses in the budget have been drastically underestimated.'' **********Although Government officials originally felt that $65 billion or $70 billion might go into the tax-exempt certificates, costing the Treasury about $3 billion in forgone tax revenues, many analysts now say that investors could put in $200 billion or more, which would mean $10 billion of forgone tax revenues. **********The certificates are authorized by the 1981 tax law, though they were added by Congress, not proposed by the Reagan Administration. It is generally agreed that the tax-exempt certificates will help savings institutions but will not succeed in drawing substantial new sums into the housing market, which was one goal of the program.  This is because savings institutions might invest the new funds in short-term money market instruments rather than long-term home mortgages. A Matter of Timing **********Initially the savings certificates will offer a yield of 12.61 percent, or $126.10 for every $1,000. Although savings institutions say they expect an influx of customers today, the first day's response may be slowed by the fact that if savers wait until tomorrow they can tell whether the certificates will offer a higher yield if not bought until next week. **********The certificates are mainly expected to draw money out of investments where income is taxable, such as certificates of deposit, money market funds, stocks and bonds. The new certificates may be bought at any time during the next 15 months. ''I think there will be a real surge,'' said Timothy J. Howard, vice president and senior financial economist at the Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. ''For anyone in a marginal tax bracket of about 35 percent or higher, the certificates offer a greater after-tax return than money market funds, six-month money-market certificates and 30-month certificates of deposit.'' **********The new certificates have received a strong lift from wide advertising by banks and other financial institutions competing to attract new money. For them, the interest they pay on the certificates will be appreciably less costly than the rates on many of the other deposits they already hold. **********The rates on the certificates are set at 70 percent of the yield on new one-year Treasury bills at the most recent monthly auction. The interest rate on a certificate will remain constant for the one-year term of the certificate, but every month the rate available on newly issued certif icates will change. **********Certificates that go on sale today will offer the 12.61 percent yield. That rate will be for certificates sold only this week, and it remains uncertain whether the new rate next week will be higher or lower. Treasury Auction Awaited **********The rate on certificates sold for the four weeks beginning Monday will be based on this afternoon's Treasury auction of one-year bills. The rate beginning Monday will be higher than the one available this week if the discount rate on one-year bills auctioned this afternoon exceeds 15.056 percent, which would amount to a yield of 18.06 percent. (The yield on a security is higher than its rate of interest, since the yield includes interest payments that are reinvested at the same rate for the entire period.) **********Financial a nalysts said yesterday that they thought the new rate would probabl y be lower, since one-year bills were trading in the market yester day afternoon at a rate of about 14.66 percent. If oneyear bills were issued at a discount rate of 14.66, the new certificates would yield about 12.21 percent. **********If the rates for next month are to be lower, investors will still have a day or two to buy certificates at the 12.61 percent yield.  Whether higher yields will be available in later months depends entirely on the future course of interest rates, a matter of considerable debate among professional economists and financial experts. Outlook for Interest Rates **********Some economists, including those advising the Reagan Administration, expect interest rates to fall in the coming months.  Others, however, predict that rates will go higher sometime within the 15-month period during which the certificates will be available. **********Sanford I. Weill, chairman of Shearson/American Express Inc., said he planned to buy certificates at the 12.61 yield. ''I believe that the President's program is going to work and that rates are going to come down,'' he said. **********''Rates are at historically high levels now,'' noted Timothy J.  Howard, senior financial economist at the Wells Fargo Bank. ''If you can live with the present rate for investment purposes, buying now would not be a bad idea. But if you feel that one-year Treasury bills are going to go above 15 percent, you might want to hold off.'' **********At least one bank, Citibank, plans to tell its customers that if the new rate beginning Monday turns out to be higher than 12.61 percent, their money will be placed at the higher rate, even if the bank gets it before Monday. **********Although interest from the new certificates (up to $1,000 or $2,000) is exempt from Federal income tax, investors should also consider whether the interest is subject to state or local tax. That varies from state to state. In New York and Connecticut, for example, the certificates will not be subject to a state tax, while in New Jersey they will be. Various Buying Patterns **********Financial advisers point out that people who do not have $8,000 or $16,000 to invest in certificates all at once could buy less than that amount or could plan to buy smaller certificates throughout the 15-month period. And they say that people who are not prepared to tie up their money for a whole year or whose top tax bracket is not 30 percent or higher should not buy the certificates at all. **********''The penalties for early withdrawal are horrendous,'' said Sheldon Chaiken, director of the financial services group at Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis, a brokerage firm. ''You forfeit the tax exemption and have to pay a penalty of three months' interest as well.'' **********Despite such penalties, the certificates are expected to attract hundreds of billions of dollars. Earlier this year, when the tax bill was considered in Congress, Federal analysts estimated that $65 billion to $70 billion would be invested in the certificates, at a cost to the Treasury of about $3 billion in forgone tax revenues. **********Many economists now predict that $200 billion or more could flow into the certificates, which could cost the Treasury more than $10 billion in forgone revenues. Data Resources Inc., the economic research firm has concluded, for example, that $237 billion will be placed in the certificates. Its figure is representative of other projections as well. 'An Unusual Situation' **********Of course, no one knows for sure how many people will buy certificates. ''I'm not even sure that an econometric model will be very worthwhile, since this is such an unusual situation'' said Alfred P. Johnson, chief economist for the Investment Company Institute, a trade group for the mutual fund industry. **********There are several reasons for the hi gher es timates. For one thing, the rates on the certificates will be somewha t higher than originallyanticipated. When Congress granted the tax ex emption, it was widely assumed that the certificates would pay 70 pe rcent of the coupon rate on one-year Treasury bills. Instead, Fed eral regulators set the return on the certificates equal to 70 percen t of the total yield, a somewhat higher figure. **********Another reason for the higher estimates now is that the tax exemption on the certificates appears to have captured the imagination of the American public. While most experts advise that people in tax brackets below 30 percent can earn higher after-tax returns in other kinds of investments, many people in lower tax brackets may purchase certificates anyway. Government revenue estimators did not count on such purchases. Big Marketi ng Push **********Finally, enthusiasm has been fanned by heavy marketing and advertising efforts. Even institutions such as brokerage firms and mutual funds that are expected to lose money to the certificates are preparing to help customers buy the certificates. Paine Webber, E.F.  Hutton, Shearson and Merrill Lynch are among the Wall Street firms planning to help interested customers move their money into the new certificates if the customer seems ready to do it. The Fidelity Management and Research Company, which manages a family of mutual funds, plans a similar service. How actively the firms market this service will depend partly on whether they are permitted to accept finders' fees from the banks. **********Even without all this help, banks and other financial institutions anticipate heavy demand for the certificates.  Despite the prospect of heavy traffic, financial experts expect relatively little disruption in the financial markets. Money fund managers, for example, expect to be able to handle withdrawals out of their normal cash flow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/21/business/investex-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTEX INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "INVESTEX INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/27/business/rail-freight-rates-up-2.8.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RAIL FREIGHT RATES UP 2.8%", "print_headline": "RAIL FREIGHT RATES UP 2.8%", "body_text": " **********The Interstate Commerce Commission said today that it had approved a 2.8 percent increase in rail freight rates to allow railroads to recoup cost increases.

The selection process is usually a question of picking a fund for the highest yield. But at a time when the funds are growing almost too fast to keep up with new business, many investors simply settle for one with an open telephone line. **********Denis Jamison, a vice president of the $700 million Lexington Management Corporation and the Englewood, N.J., management company's money fund specialist, believes it essential that the investor look beyond high yields and ready accessibility in picking a fund. **********Before he went to Lexington, he managed the Value Line Cash Fund and produced the highest yield for a money fund in 1980. **********In selecting a fund, Mr. Jamison said, the investor should examine the fund's holdings and should be comfortable with its portfolio. He added, as an example, that some timid investors were more comfortable with money funds that invest in United States Government securities only. But the investor should realize that this timidity would cost a substantial yield, he stressed. **********''A number of money funds investing in commercial paper and Eurodollar deposits currently offer 17 1/2 percent to 18 percent yields compared with 16 percent to 16 1/2 percent for funds buying only U.S. Governments,'' he added. ''In my opinion, the difference in risk is minimal.'' He argued that most fund managers were highly professional - fully capable of evaluating the creditworthiness of the securities they buy. **********In Mr. Jamison's view, the key risk is in illiquid money funds - those with unusually long average maturities. On one or two occasions, when interest rates have spurted, funds holding securities with maturities in excess of 60 days have suffered. Under those circumstances, he said, the dollar value of the money fund can be jeopardized. That is, prices of securities outstanding drop until their yields equal those offered by new securities of similar quality. **********Investors have not lost money even so. Mr. Jamison noted that when a Chicago-based fund called Institutional Liquid Assets was caught in such a bind some time ago investors began withdrawing funds heavily, but its managers shored it up with their own capital. The result was that those redeeming shares were paid at face amounts. **********Mr. Jamison believes that money fund managers have learned an important lesson from that near disaster and that the risk of similar episodes has been minimized. He said that the maturity of money funds generally now averaged less than 30 days and this suggested to him that the money funds were liquid enough to meet any and all redemptions - even if interest rates rose suddenly. **********On the other hand, when interest rates plunge, those money funds with relatively long maturities can, for a time, provide higher yields than short-maturity money funds - until existing holdings become due. But, Mr. Jamison said, a sudden drop in interest rates ''creates no risk'' to funds with short maturities even though their yields drop faster. This is because wholesale redemptions, should they develop, can be met with funds produced as the short-term securities mature, he added. **********Mr. Jamison spoke of another jarring event -fluctuating yields.  These result from an accounting practice called ''marking to market,'' he said. That is, each day the fund's manager prices certain securities - those in the portfolio maturing in 60 days or more - at current market values. In a period of fluctuating interest rates, the holder of shares in such money funds finds that yields fluctuate, too, and widely. **********On the other hand, some sophisticated purchasers of money fund shares are now switching into funds that mark to market during periods of falling interest rates. In such periods, the prices of the securities in the mark-to-market funds will rise and produce capital gains. While these gains are unrealized, the mark-to-market funds credit them immediately to shareholder accounts and this adds to yields. By contrast, funds carrying their portfolios at cost do not write up the value of holdings in such periods and therefore have no extras to credit. **********Anyone who is distressed by the fluctuations in yields in such money funds may prefer money funds that carry all securities at cost less amortization, Mr. Jamison said. **********Mr. Jamison offered some general words of advice. ''First,'' he said, ''examine the money fund's yield over an extended period of time - preferably for a year or more. How consistent has it been in comparison with other funds?'' Short-term and long-term performances of most money market funds are listed in ''William E. Donoghue's Complete Money Market Guide,'' published by Harper & Row. **********''Second,'' Mr. Jamison added, ''note the fees the manager charges; the range is 30 to 50 basis points.'' (A basis point is one onehundredth of a percentage point.) ''If the manager charges a high fee and gives extra services, well and good; but make sure the high-fee manager doesn't buy speculative securities to keep up with the other money funds.'' **********''Third,'' he concluded, ''examine the services the fund offers.  Can the investor move to another fund quickly when the investment climate dictates a move? Most important, can you get someone in authority on the telephone and get sound advice when you need guidance?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/11/world/france-s-president-says-he-sold-bokassa-jewels.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "France's President Says He Sold Bokassa Jewels", "print_headline": "France's President Says He Sold Bokassa Jewels", "body_text": " **********President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France said tonight that jewels given him by Jean-Bedel Bokassa, the former leader of the Central African Republic, had been sold and the money given to charities in the African nation. **********Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said the jewels could hardly be described as diamonds. **********''They were not big stones,'' he said, ''only something that could be used as a decoration or as jewelery.'' **********Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, who was speaking in the first television interview of his campaign for re-election, went into greater detail on the subject of the diamonds than on any previous occasion. **********The French weekly Le Canard Enchaine broke the story of the diamonds in October 1979 when it published documents purporting to prove that Mr. Giscard d'Estaing had received diamonds from Mr.  Bokassa, who proclaimed himself Emperor Bokassa I and who was deposed in September 1979."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/18/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Sandra Salmans", "pub_date": "1981-08-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** Richard Chrampanis named advertising director of Co-Ed and Forecast magazines. *********** Frederick W.

South Africa was expelled from the Commonwealth in 1961 because of its policy of apartheid, or separation of the races. **********Rebuffed in its demand that the tour be canceled, the Commonwealth has retaliated by shifting a meeting of its finance ministers next month from Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand, to the Bahamas. **********Robert D. Muldoon, New Zealand's Prime Minister, says the dispute threatens the future of the Commonwealth, which is one of the few world organizations promoting frequent, informal contacts between the industrialized North and the developing South. The issue is sure to be passionately debated when Commonwealth heads of government meet in Melbourne, Australia, in October. Two Matches Canceled **********The New Zealand matches are part of a world tour by the Springbok team that will include games in the United States in September.  Mayor Koch, who had approved plans for the Springboks to play a game on Randalls Island next month, reversed himself yesterday and ordered the game canceled. **********Demonstrations, some of them surprisingly violent for the usually placid island nation in the South Pacific, have accompanied the Springbok stops in New Zealand. The second of 16 matches, which was to have been played in Hamilton, was called off when 300 people opposed to apartheid occupied the field and could not be moved.  Another contest, scheduled for Aug. 19, was canceled well in advance. **********Retired members of the police force have been recalled to duty and special constables have been appointed in an effort to maintain peace in the streets and on the playing fields. More than 4,000 of the country's 5,000 policemen are involved in coping with the situation. **********The dispute illustrates the deep divisions within the Commonwealth, which is united only by a shared history and a common language.  For the black and brown nations that form a large majority of the Commonwealth's 44 members, the isolation of South Africa is the central political goal, almost a crusade, especially now that Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, does not have a white regime. For several members of what is euphemistically called the Old Commonwealth, meaning the predominantly white nations, the abuses of human rights and democratic traditions in many black member countries are of equal significance. An Agreement on a Boycott **********In 1977 the Commonwealth countries agreed at a conference in Scotland to a voluntary athletic boycott of South Africa. In a document known as the Gleneagles Agreement, they said it was ''the urgent duty of each government vigorously to combat the evil of apartheid by withholding any form of support for, and taking every practical step to discourage, sporting contacts with South Africa.'' New Zealand signed the agreement, but only after insisting that it would not undertake to dictate to athletes in New Zealand. **********From the beginning, Mr. Muldoon has insisted that he did not approve of the tour and said he would like to ''get shot of it.'' The Prime Minister made four attempts to persuade the New Zealand Rugby Union to call off the tour, urging it at various times ''to reconsider,'' to ''think again'' and to ''weigh the consequences.'' But the Government never formally called upon the union to cancel the tour, and it decided, in keeping with its standing policy, not to refuse visas to the Springboks, as other Commonwealth nations have done. **********Mr. Muldoon said, ''To take from our sportsmen and our sporting bodies the right to make their own final decision on whom they would play against, or with whom they would play, would be to take from them a freedom which they have always had and which is just one of many freedoms which the citizens of a civilized country should enjoy.'' Criticism for Muldoon **********Sir Shridath Ramphal of Guyana, the Commonwealth's Secretary General, concedes that the Gleneagles Agreement does not require New Zealand to deny visas to the South Africans. But he argues that its decision to grant the visas imposed on Mr. Muldoon a duty to fulfill his obligations under the agreement by other means. **********''Gleneagles left it to each government to find and employ its own means of discouragement, and it held out the assurance of success,'' Sir Shridath wrote in an article in The Times of London. ''The question is not one of interpretation, it is one of performance, and it is one on which many Commonwealth countries are less than satisfied.'' **********Mr. Muldoon, the conservative leader of perhaps the most conservative major Commonwealth nation, is loath to be dictated to by New Commonwealth leaders, some of whom he has called ''gangsters.'' He attacked Sir Shridath this week, asserting that the Guyanese leader was so committed to the views of black nations that ''no argument of principle will override that allegiance.'' He accused the Secretary General of ''hypocritical platitudes and downright mis-statements.'' **********His opponents in New Zealand accuse the Prime Minister of acting as he has done for domestic political reasons rather than on principle.  They note, for example, that New Zealand refused entry to a group of Rhodesian golfers in 1976 and a group from Taiwan in 1977."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/27/business/cordis-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CORDIS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "CORDIS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/06/business/executive-changes-071536.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 266, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Canon U.S.A.

And then there are Argentines.  In the last 30 years many countries have risen and fallen in the inflation ranks, but Argentina has remained near the top. The rate of increase in consumer prices peaked at nearly 450 percent in 1976.  Last year, it was under 90 percent, and some Government officials crowed success. But this year many economists expect the rate to shoot back up. **********Inflation has contributed to a cost of living that the State Department ranks second only to Japan's. The daily newspaper costs 60 cents. A cup of coffee in an ordinary coffee shop costs $1. Rents for a two-bedroom apartment in areas equivalent to Manhattan's Upper East and West Sides begin at $2,000 a month. **********The causes are lost in mounds of statistics and competing economic theories. The effects are found in jammed stores and crowded psychiatrists' offices, in a national cynicism and - sometimes - individual sadness that has helped replace the country's reputation for gaiety. Fast Money and Hard Luck **********''For 10 years we have have been told things will get better,'' said Alberto Piro as he arranged the fruits and vegetables in his small shop. ''Now we are just waiting for better times.'' **********In the meantime, Argentines have turned to ingenuity, creating a country of speculators and moonlighters, of fast money and hard luck.  Playing the interest rates has become a national pastime.Thirtyday savings certificates - and no one commits his money for longer - pay interest at an annual rate of about 100 percent. **********People punching pocket calculators stand outside bank windows daily, studying the day's posted rates. In the last year more than 40 small banks and financial houses have collapsed in the wheeling and dealing. While rumors that a place is about to fold lead most people to start a run on the institution, the more daring increase their deposits, hoping to reap higher rates and be saved by Government guarantees on deposits. **********But then consumers pay even more for mortgages, automobile loans and the like. Interest is usually indexed to inflation, so buying on credit is an adventure into the unknown on payments. A Scheme With a Flaw **********Interest rates are so high that American bankers here are courted by Argentines wanting loans of several million dollars, which they convert to pesos and deposit in local banks, often earning enough interest in a month to pay back the loan and make a handsome profit. **********The scheme works so long as the interest rate outstrips devaluations. In the last two months, however, the Government has devalued the peso 40 percent. Some instant millionaires have become instant paupers, although most anticipated the devaluation and created a run on foreign reserves by switching into dollars, marks, yen and gold. **********The speculation has helped create a large class of nouveaux riches who have turned this city's stately old neighborhood of Barrio Norte into canyons of high-rises and choking auto fumes. **********The wealthy, new and old, hedge in the Argentine tradition of sending money to Zurich and buying land - or at least apartments - in Punta del Este, Miami and New York as well as here. 'Horror' Story About Maids **********But there are also losers, even among the rich. One matronly dowager who was approached in a food market complained bitterly.  Before, she had two live-in maids. Now she has only one maid come twice a week. ''A horror,'' she said. **********Picking among the onions and apples at Mr. Piro's shop, Mary Rollinson, an American who lives here, said, ''Many people here are putting on a show of living well even though they are on the verge of bankruptcy and cannot pay the rent.'' **********The Economics Ministry says real income has risen over the last several years. Certainly many Argentines from bankers to plumbers have done well. Many have salaries indexed to the inflation rate, and many people who set their own fees, such as doctors and carpenters, charge almost at will. Having a baby, for example, costs $5,000 in private medical and hospital fees. **********It is this new middle class that hedges in the panoply of imported appliances such as juicers and color televisions that have been flooding stores. The military Government has been dropping import tariffs in the hope that the competition of cheaper and better imported goods would cut prices on domestic goods. **********Factory workers, who have benefitted from erratic past protectionist policies, are thus less fortunate this time around.  Their companies are strapped by the competition and the interest rates on loans. Some have closed, and even the military fears workers' reaction. **********In February, the Institute of Economic Investigation of the University of Buenos Aires surveyed 300 major factories in the capital area and found that it takes workers longer to earn the price of such basic items as bread and milk than it did a year ago. Wine was one of the few items to be cheaper in terms of working time. **********Argentina, nonetheless, is a primarily middle-class country that still enjoys the highest standard of living in Latin America.  Unskilled laborers in the survey earned up to $8,700 a year, while skilled workers earned $4,000 to $15,000 and their plant supervisors earned up to $28,000. The Retired Suffer the Most **********This middle class gambles, too. Some laid-off factory workers have reportedly bought cement and wood, held them, then sold them after the price rose, which is usually within a month. **********The majority, however, appear to do as Mr. Piro does. His Falcon is 11 years old, and he has put off buying the color television and new refrigerator he would like. **********The retired suffer the most. Two weeks ago, the military Government decreed a quarterly increase of 16 percent for all pensioners. Buenos Aires municipal taxes will rise 150 percent this year. The Economics Ministry has ordered an increase of over 15 percent in all utility charges over the next three months. **********But storekeepers cannot so easily multiply their prices. ''You cannot raise your prices too much,'' Jose Maria Llama, a butcher, said. ''People get scared and do not buy.'' **********The pressures have contributed to what many psychiatrists and psychologists say is an explosion in recent years in the number of people who seek their help. **********''You do not learn to live with the inflation,'' the owner of a fabric shop said. ''You learn how to adapt to live with the constant economic anxiety.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/05/business/mobil-starting-first-coal-mine.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mobil Starting First Coal Mine", "print_headline": "Mobil Starting First Coal Mine", "body_text": " **********The Mobil Corporation said yesterday that it had begun construction of a coal mine in the Powder River Basin near Gillette, Wyo., marking the oil company's first venture in the coal mining business. **********The start of construction was cleared on Tuesday by the issuance of the last of more than 24 Federal and state authorizations, it said.

Corporations, she said, direct their philanthropic programs to areas where they have business operations, whereas the Government's focus is national. **********The upward trend in corporate contributions by large and mediumsized companies, as well as individual giving, is also showing up in the response to the 2,100 fund-raising campaigns currently being conducted across the country by United Way, according to William Aramony, president of United Way of America. Last year, $1.5 billion was raised. **********These developments were welcomed by Brian O'Connell, president of the Independent Sector, a Washington-based coalition of foundations, nonprofit organizations and corporations committed to pilanthropy.  But he cautioned against excessive optimism that resources from the private sector could compensate for the huge cutbacks in Government support for the country's 300,000 nonprofit groups. These include universities, community associations helping the poor and disabled, and a broad spectrum of cultural organizations. **********''Even with this growth, we should not give the impression to nonprofit organizations and to the people they serve that the gap will be filled,'' he said. **********He said that the current estimate of direct losses to the nonprofit organizations was $20 billion over the next three years.  Corporations represent a growing but relatively small share of philanthropy. Corporate giving last year totaled $2.7 billion.  Foundations provided $2.4 billion. The major share of philanthropy, as usual, came from individual donors who last year contributed $39.9 billion, most of it for religious organizations. **********Many corporate executives in interviews said they expected to see companies increase their contributions, but underscored that the response of the business sector would depend on the country's economic situation. **********''It is not realistic in these days of lagging productivity, cost inflation and earnings pressure to expect that shareholders generally would accept large increases in corporate contributions,'' said Walter A. Fallon, chairman of the Eastman Kodak Corporation. The company said it expected to make a ''moderate'' increase in giving. **********For the next year or two, nonprofit organizations are likely to have to retrench, merge or go out of business, said Alex J. Plinio, vice president of corporate contributions at the Prudential Insurance Company. Budget Cut a Small Factor **********The planned increases in corporate giving were attributed only in small part to the budget reductions or the President's appeals to business leaders. The Conference Board survey showed that only 15 companies said they were expanding giving in response to the budget situation. **********The rate of increases planned by a number of the larger contributors would barely outpace inflation.  Exxon, the country's top corporate contributor, expects its donations to rise to more than $50 million in 1982, up from $45 million this year, said Richard F. Neblett, contributions coordinator. **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company and its affiliates in the Bell System expect contributions this year to be about $45 million and to approach $50 million in 1982, according to Robert Thill, secretary of contributions. He said the rise reflected increased recognition of the nonprofit groups' substantial needs that ''are coming home to us more forcefully only in the last few years,'' adding that the reduction in Government support had increased significantly the demands for corporate aid. **********William A. Orme, secretary of the General Electric Foundation, agreed, and calculated that requests for grants were arriving at a rate of one every 26 seconds and posing problems for executives who wanted to deal responsibly with them and not ''merely shuffle papers.'' Contributions next year were expected to go up to $19.5 million, a 50 percent rise. **********Atlantic Richfield, another major donor, has raised contributions to more than $34 million, the major share channeled through its company foundation. Among others, United States Steel, Westinghouse Electric, International Business Machines and Standard Oil (Indiana) plan to increase grants substantially. **********The response to the United Way campaigns from business and individuals is running particularly strong in the West, Southwest and Northeast, according to campaign officials. They said that cities with high unemployment rates were watched anxiously but that Detroit was expected to exceed its $42 million goal and that Cleveland was ahead of last year's record. **********The impact of the Federal budget cuts was an underlying theme at the 1981 National Conference on Philanthropy held recently in Minneapolis by the Independent Sector. **********John H. Filer, chairman of the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, counseled nonprofit organizations against believing that the Reagan Administration was ''dumping'' all social problems on the private sector and making it a scapegoat for future social disarray. The Federal Government wants a partnership with the private sector, he maintained. **********But the optimism expressed by some conference participants about the future for nonprofit groups appeared troubling to others.  ''What I sense lacking is a sense of urgency,'' said Eleanor P.  Petersen, president of Chicago's Donor's Forum, adding, ''Sure, organizations are in trouble but it is really people who are in trouble, the disadvantaged, children, women and minorities. The pain out there is terrible and it is not getting through to them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/28/business/portugal-cuts-expenditures.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Portugal Cuts Expenditures", "print_headline": "Portugal Cuts Expenditures", "body_text": " **********Portugal's Government clamped down today on spending in an effort to contain its budget deficit. **********The new budget will limit spending in nonessential areas, streamline the governmental structure and try to improve productivity in all departments by 3 percent.

Palladino, chairman of the commission, to the chairmen of several Congressional committees. The letter, unanimously approved by the panel, also states that the commission is ''reviewing our responsibilities'' under the Atomic Energy Act ''for the licensing of nuclear exports.'' **********While the international agency's monitoring has increasingly come under attack by legislators and other critics, the letter from the five-member, independent regulatory commission is the first official Government assertion that the safeguards system is ineffective for some nuclear installations. U.S. Expresses Concern **********The commission did not specify which types of installations posed monitoring problems, but one commission official said that some members of the panel were particularly concerned about atomic reactors that are continuously loaded as well as facilities that engage in the fabrication, enrichment or reprocessing of uranium and nuclear fuel. **********The continuously loading reactor, which uses natural uranimum as fuel, was developed by Canada and has been sold to nations such as India and Pakistan. The State Department and the International Atomic Energy Agency recently expressed private concern about the ability to monitor such reactors. **********The United States makes reactors that are periodically loaded and, therefore, easier to monitor.  One commission official said that the letter to Congressional committees was prompted by the panel's growing concern about the adequacy of safeguards ''accross the board,'' but particularly in a number of nuclear installations abroad. **********The commission's review of its responsibilities could have serious ramifications for the export of nuclear technology, which at present is licensed by the commission. **********While the commission requires that the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency be applied to recipients of the exports, it has not routinely debated whether the monitoring system is adequate or likely to prevent the diversion of American-supplied nuclear material or technology from civilian to military purposes. **********Should the commission decide that the system is unreliable, it might decide to reject or delay nuclear exports.

Recently it lived up to its reputation. **********One afternoon, a bolt of lightning struck the school at Biego in western Kenya, crackled around the classroom and killed 11 children.  It was, villagers recounted, the sixth time in their memory that lightning had struck the school. That, they said, could be no coincidence. And their response to the disaster said much about that part of Africa that lies beyond the modernity introduced by recent history. **********For an explanation of the inexplicable, the villagers fell back on what seemed most natural to them: the supernatural. Or, rather, the folly of others who had ignored the requisite magic to deal with it. **********''Our ancestors who lived here died of an unknown epidemic,'' said John Nyamara, a teacher at the school. ''But there was no sacrifice made.'' Now, he said, it is too late for the ancestral spirits to accept sacrifice, so the spirits' curse that brought the first, anonymous epidemic lives on, manifest in bolts of lightning and the village's name. Beliefs Deeply Felt **********His explanation raised few eyebrows here, for beliefs that are sometimes ridiculed in Western societies are woven deep in the fabric of life in some parts of Africa. **********Curses are still put on people in Africa, students of these traditions say, and spirit doctors still lift the maledictions. There is said to be a world where spirits are as quick as the living and where the past does not disappear with death, but lives on through the ghosts of ancestors who mold the fortunes of the earthly. **********In Zambia, for instance, there is a man who, for a fee, will prepare potions and make imprecations to these spirits and then blow up the inner tube of a bicycle tire. Simultaneously, he tells the client who has ordered this magic to hurt an adversary that the enemy's stomach will grow and swell. Then, the foe must seek a healer to raise the curse and deflate the stomach, or die. **********In Zimbabwe recently, the police were called to investigate a string of murders of white farmers. Their inquiries led to a woman who said that a spirit had come to live in her and had ordered the killings. A Fabled Spirit **********The inspiration, she said, was that of Nehanda, a fabled spirit on whose orders young men went to kill the white invaders of the colonial 1890's. Nehanda is sometimes credited with starting the black nationalist war of liberation that, nearly a century later, brought an end to white rule in what used to be called Rhodesia. **********In many parts of Africa, Kenya among them, witchcraft is illegal, and nowhere is it officially encouraged in all its forms. The Kenyan authorities have undertaken vigorous campaigns against it.  But laws enacted in distant capitals sometimes hold little sway among those confronted daily with the threat of arbitrary natural disasters in need of explanation -droughts, or floods, or famines, or bolts of lightning. **********The courts of some countries, including Zimbabwe, will on occasion accept a plea that the defendant acted out of a belief in the spirit world. **********In the first few months of this year, 80 Zimbabweans were charged, in separate cases, with murder. All of them said that they were not murderers, but killers of witches who had performed necessary tasks to rid their communities of evil by doing away with the possessed, often brutally. Their sentences were generally from 3 to 13 years. Old and New Coexist **********Witchcraft is as old as man's own sense of horror. But in Africa it has blended with the new so that it coexists with Christianity and the advance of modern politics. **********According to a recent study, ''The Struggle for Zimbabwe,'' by David Martin and Phyllis Johnson, guerrillas fighting white rule in Zimbabwe were given inspiration by a frail old woman in whom Nehanda's spirit was said to reside. **********Zimbabwe's Health Minister, Herbert Ushewokunze, insists that traditional and modern medicine should coexist since they complement each other: where one fails, the other succeeds, as is said to have happened for a man called News Horufu. **********According to accounts of the case, News Horufu lived in a village north of Salisbury, the capital of Zimbabwe, and was prone to fits of extreme violence. His parents chained him to a tree for 10 years.  Occasionally, when calm descended on him, they would unchain him and take him to a hospital, but he could not be cured. Spirit Doctors Take Case **********Then his case came to the attention of Zimbabwe's traditional healers. The spirit doctors took him under their care. After a few weeks, according to the accounts, News Horufu was healed and was not chained to the tree again. **********The case illustrates one of the categories into which those called witch doctors by Westerners can be divided. News Horufu was reportedly cured by a traditional healer whose adeptness was said to lie in treating psychosomatic and other psychiatric maladies through the language and rituals of longstanding tradition. **********Other traditional healers say that they act as conduits of communication between the stricken on earth and the spirits of ancestors who, according to Dr. Ushewokunze and others, channel the inspiration of a life source that animists hold to be the ultimate power. **********These healers are said to communicate with the spirits in trances that, in Zimbabwe, are invoked with closed eyes.  The spirit is then said to speak through the healers. Believers feel that spirits may be appeased in advance by sacrifices, such as rituals to insure that rains come and crops grow. If they are not appeased, as the villagers of Biego believe, there is disaster. Spirits, too, may reside in animals, which then become holy, according to believers. **********Still a third category of African traditional healers are herbalists, whose potions and remedies may be more acceptable to some - and cheaper - than modern medicines. The act of taking the remedies, Western doctors say, may be as much a cure as the remedy itself - a phenomenon not confined to Africa."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/06/business/appliance-park-recall-by-ge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Appliance Park Recall by G.E.", "print_headline": "Appliance Park Recall by G.E.", "body_text": " **********About 10,000 workers at General Electric Company's giant Appliance Park here have been recalled from two-week furloughs, but 900 G.E. employees with the least seniority face indefinite layoffs beginning Nov. 9. **********The 10,000 workers were laid off for two weeks as G.E. sought to reduce its inventory of unsold major appliances such as ranges, refrigerators and washers. **********Another 5,000 workers had been laid off for one week and returned to work Sept. 28. **********In addition to the indefinite layoffs pending Nov. 9 for 900 worke rs, anot her 13,000 employees face temporary layoffs during November and December at Appliance Park, Kentucky's largest private employer. **********About 1,750 range workers will be laid off Nov. 30-Dec. 22, about 5,600 workers in the refrigerator division will be laid off Dec.  7-22, about 4,400 people who make washers, dryers and dishwashers will be laid off Dec. 13-22 and 1,700 people who make air-conditioners will be laid off Dec. 21 and 22. **********G.E. has attributed the layoffs to persistent high interest rates which affect sales of major appliances and the slumping home building industry, Appliance Park's biggest customer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/30/business/oman-japan-oil-price-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oman-Japan Oil Price Pact", "print_headline": "Oman-Japan Oil Price Pact", "body_text": " **********Oman has lowered the price of its crude oil shipped to Japan between October and December by $1.50 a barrel, to $34, Government officials said today. **********The International Trade and Industry Ministry said Oman, not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, was the first Middle East producer to lower its crude price to $34 a barrel apart from Saudi Arabia, which is sticking to $32. **********Japan imports 50,000 barrels a day of crude from Oman. **********A ministry spokesman said three Japanese trading houses and an oil refinery were likely to stop imports of Iranian crude tomorrow when their contracts expired following a pricing dispute with the National Iranian Oil Company. **********The four companies are seeking a cut in the price of Iranian light crude from $37 to about $32 a barrel, he said.

Some company officials criticized the United States Government for the action. **********Most industry officials discounted the possibility that Tripoli would retaliate by nationalizing United States companies or by conducting an embargo on oil sales to this country. However, they said they were concerned about the safety of American personnel and their families. **********Indeed, growing worries over the safety of the approximately 1,500 United States citizens working and living in Libya, mostly for oil companies, seemed to have replaced an initial apparent lack of concern that companies expressed immediately after news that two United States Navy fighters had shot down two Libyan fighters on Wednesday. Evacuation by Exxon **********Exxon became the first company to evacuate dependents of its employees, a step the five other American companies operating in Libya are also considering. Mobil has prepared what it called ''a readiness plan.'' Both companies declined to provide details, as did others that are also considering evacuations. **********A number of companies even declined to give the specific number of employees and dependents they have in Libya, partly on the theory that the information could prove sensitive if the situation should worsen. Typically, most companies have considerably fewer than 100 United States citizens each. However, numerous American oilfield service companies, such as Halliburton, also employ Americans in Libya. **********In general, however, oil industry experts in the United States and Libya suggested that, so far, the Libyan position had been moderate, especially when compared with what some view as aggressiveness on the part of the United States. American Action Criticized **********''This was a blunder, a very foolish big-stick move on the part of the United States,'' declared a high official of an American oil company speaking by telephone from Tripoli. ''But we were given assurances that the chances of retaliation are very, very slim.'' **********The official said the assurances were made in a meeting with top officials of Libya's ministries for heavy industry and oil. He further reported that the Americans living in Libya remained ''calm,'' oilfield operations had not been impaired and Libyan citizens had not conducted any large demonstrations. ''It's business as usual,'' he said. **********''The authorities have handled this in a very low-key way,'' the oil executive continued. ''The community is very calm. There is no cause for concern.'' He even joked that the Libyans had not yet called in the ''rent-a-crowds'' that are often assembled for protests against the United States. **********The American-based oil companies operating in Libya are Conoco, Marathon, Amerada Hess, Occidental Petroleum, Exxon and Mobil. In addition, Italian, French and German companies produce oil there.  The American companies produce crude oil in Libya themselves, in joint ventures with the state-owned oil company, and purchase crude oil from the state company for export. Their investments include oil well equipment, pipelines, export terminals and some refining operations for the 70,000-barrel-a-day Libyan market. Nationalization Discounted **********Most American companies dismissed the possibility of nationalization, but several well-placed European oil executives suggested there was at least an even chance that Tripoli would make such a move. Lending support to this speculation was a threat yesterday in Abu Dhabi by Mohammed al-Qamoudi, head of the Libyan Brotherhood Bureau, to use the ''oil weapon.'' **********Nationalization of oil properties has been a tactic of Tripoli since it seized British Petroleum's Libyan operations in 1971. In 1974, Libya became the first country to nationalize foreign properties for specifically political reasons when it took over the operations of Standard Oil of California, Texaco, Royal Dutch/Shell and Atlantic Richfield to protest a meeting of the Western oilconsuming nations to formulate a common strategy to deal with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. **********Oil analysts said that Libyan nationalizations were considerably more punitive than most nations. Tripoli, in a continuing wave of nationalizations, has ignored the value of oil in the ground and the future revenues of companies as factors in determining compensation.  It has only considered the depreciated value of the actual hardware used to produce oil, an amount that industry analysts say is almost neglibile. Production Figures Guarded **********Most companies are reluctant to disclose how much oil they have been producing in Libya, because they have been drastically reducing both their own production as well as the amount they buy from the Libyan Government. Although these reductions are an acknowledged tool to force Tripoli to cut its price of $40 a barrel, the highest among the 13 nations in OPEC, companies shrink from highlighting the issue because of fears that it would it will embarrass their host country. **********But the companies made it clear that, at least for the present, they could do without Libya's oil. Output has dropped to 600,000 barrels daily, a third of capacity. This clearly reduces the effectiveness of an embargo against the United States, which gets less than 5 percent of its oil from Libya. **********Nevertheless, analysts are convinced that Libya could sustain a long embargo. G. Henry M. Schuler, who has worked as both an American diplomat and a company representative in Libya, said that the Libyans had $10 billion invested in gold and hard currency reserves, large overseas holdings and credit with some of the world's biggest banks.  And they have a much smaller population than such hard-pressed oilproducing nations as Nigeria. **********''We'd cry uncle before they did,'' Mr. Schuler said. The other arguments that the Libyans will probably weigh in deciding how to punish the United States, he said, are the example of the precipitous decline in Iran's petroleum production after that country ejected foreign companies, and the fact the continued presence of American citizens on Libyan soil increases Tripoli's leverage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/09/business/beneficial-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-march-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 30, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BENEFICIAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "print_headline": "BENEFICIAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to March 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/04/business/rohr-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-3.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ROHR INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 3", "print_headline": "ROHR INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 3", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/01/business/soviet-india-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet-India Pact", "print_headline": "Soviet-India Pact", "body_text": " **********India and the Soviet Union signed an initial agreement today for Soviet technical aid to help India nearly double its oil production by 1984-85. **********The Indian Petroleum Minister, Prakash Chand Sethi, said the Soviet assistance would help India increase oil production beyond its target of 600,000 barrels a day by 1985.

Usually it buys a bigger home, but these days, with interest rates at twice their levels of just a couple of years ago, such a move is often impossible. The alternative? A smaller loan to add a room or two to the existing home. **********Home improvement loans could soon become much easier to obtain because the Government is getting into the business. Last month the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation - Freddie Mac - began a oneyear pilot program not unlike its mortgage program. It has set aside $200 million to purchase home-improvement loans from participating lending institutions, thereby freeing the lenders to extend more loans. **********The $200 million is a minuscule amount, but Freddie Mac expects that if the pilot project proves itself this year, it will then initiate a full-scale program involving billions of dollars.  Meanwhile, another Government-sponsored corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association -Fannie Mae - has developed a similar multibillion-dollar program of its own. If approved by the Reagan Administration, it could get under way by late summer. **********Home improvement loans under the Freddie Mac pilot program offer borrowers some important advantages over the usual loan. Terms are exceptionally liberal, with fixed periods of five, 10, 15 or 20 years. The owner of a condominium can receive a maximum loan of $15,000, a single-family structure qualifies for up to $30,000, while a two-to-four family structure is eligible for a loan up to $60,000.  In all cases, the residence must be owner-occupied. **********Without the program, many lending institutions might agree to lend only $5,000, or make the funds available for a maximum of five years. Furthermore, the interest rate is certain to be more favorable than what the borrower would have paid had he been compelled to refinance his first mortgage or take out a second one. Generally, said Donald E. Miller, the Freddie Mac program's director of underwriting, the rate for a home improvement loan might be 1 to 2 percentage points higher than that for a first mortgage. **********The program under study at Fannie Mae differs in some important respects from Freddie Mac's. For one thing, it would accept home improvement loans with adjustable interest rates as well as fixed rates. For a fixed-rate loan, Fannie Mae would grant a minimum term of three years, and a maximum term of only five years. In the case of an adjustable-rate loan, however, it would set a maximum 15-year term for amounts below $15,000, and a maximum 30-year term for loans of $15,000 or more. **********As adjustable-rate loans are still effectively prohibited by about 30 states, however, Freddie Mac's terms would seem to be more attractive to the borrower than Fannie Mae's. On the other hand, the proposed Fannie Mae program does not require that two-to-four unit dwellings be owner-occupied. It should be cautioned, however, that the latter program has yet to win official approval, and could emerge significantly changed. **********The potential size of the demand for the two programs could be immense. According to Freddie Mac, about $42 billion was spent on home repairs and improvements in 1979, and such expenditures are expected to grow to $75 billion by 1984. **********''There are many families who are forced into buying a new home simply because they have outgrown their old one,'' declared John Dalton, a Freddie Mac director. ''With funds more readily available for home improvement, we can expect a certain easing of the pressure for new units.'' **********The program, it is hoped, will also help restore deterioriating inner cities and conserve energy by financing fuel-efficient measures, including solar-energy systems. **********Money for housing-related loans of all kinds has been squeezed by the tight credit conditions of recent years. But where the Government had previously stepped in to ease the situation in the mortgage market through Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, only now is it beginning to take a similarly active role in home improvement financing. **********Basically, both Government-sponsored corporations buy mortgages from banks and other lenders, providing them with the funds to make additional mortgages. This ''secondary market'' for mortgages has helped prevent any real shortage of mortgage money, although it has been available at record rates of interest. Until now, however, no such secondary market has existed for home improvement loans. **********Under the new program, banks and other financial institutions can sell 80 percent of their home-improvement loans to Freddie Mac and re-invest the recouped funds. The lenders thus improve their portfolios' yields and, through continual turnover, avoid being stuck with long-term loans at below-market rates. **********The main difference for the borrower will be the greater availability of home-improvement financing during periods of tight money. In most cases, individual borrowers will be unaware that their loans have been sold, and they will continue making payments to their local bank. **********In the long term, Mr. Miller said, the program may lead to a decline in interest rates as more funds become available and the cost of money to lending institutions is reduced. If the program succeeds, he added, even lending institutions that aren't in it may adopt its terms in order to compete. **********Another possible consequence of the program is that others besides Freddie Mac will follow its initiative in buying home improvement loans, leading to a private-sector secondary market in home-improvement loans similar to that in home mortgages. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have together developed uniform, nationwide documentation, such as notes and deeds of trust. The hope is that the standardization of documents will facilitate more interstate purchases of home improvement loans by financial institutions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/26/business/butler-national-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-apr-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUTLER NATIONAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Apr 30", "print_headline": "BUTLER NATIONAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Apr 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/18/world/the-un-today-feb-18-1981-general-assembly.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Right now, I'd say refiners are handling between 320 and 330 million barrels a month,'' he said. **********Since late January, when prices of domestically produced oil were decontrolled, the gap between foreign and domestically produced crude has narrowed dramatically. **********''In February, the first month after decontrol, there was a spread of almost $3 per barrel between foreign and domestic oil,'' Mr.  Gowland said. ''In September, our preliminary price data show that the difference is $1.33.'' In September, domestic crude cost refiners $33.10, and imported oil, $34.43."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/19/business/growth-and-risks-for-bosch.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1981-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GROWTH, AND RISKS, FOR BOSCH", "print_headline": "GROWTH, AND RISKS, FOR BOSCH", "body_text": " **********Some people like to think of the Robert Bosch company as a West German auto parts manufacturer with hobbies.  Although Bosch diversified into products like home appliances and radio equipment as early as the 1920's, its reputation still rests largely on its sophisticated auto ignitions, fuel injection and lighting systems. **********But now Bosch plans a major investment in telecommunications, using as a channel the operations of the faltering AEG-Telefunken group.  Executives at Bosch headquarters outside this south German city hope the new venture will grow into one of its most profitable. **********''This is the entrance ticket to a market we think has an enormous future,'' said Kurt Losten, the Bosch board member for sales and international activities. ''We already have much of the know-how. We now will have the possibility to develop very interesting comprehensive systems.'' The Symbolism of Bosch **********The new development is being watched closely in Europe. The telecommunications sector is widely expected to see tremendous expansion in the 1980's. In addition, the family-owned Bosch is viewed as something of a pillar of fiscal and managerial stability in a German industrial world where recession, strained finances and spreading pessimism are bringing a record harvest of bankruptcies among weak companies, and shockingly shrunken profits even among the traditionally strong. **********In recent weeks, Bosch has entered into a complex series of deals that will give it, by 1983, a controlling share of Telefonbau und Normalzeit, the telephone systems manufacturer now 41 percent owned by AEG-Telefunken, and strong minority interests in AEG's telecommunications division and Olympia office machine subsidiary. **********It will share these interests with Mannesmann, a steel company that is also branching out into electronics, and with several banks and an insurance company to establish a large new German telecommunications group. 'Saving' a Profitable Company **********The idea is to bring Bosch's capital and expertise in things like radio and television equipment, power antennas and wide-band communications equipment to the AEG division that is among its most profitable, but that could be dragged down by the overall weakness of the parent. AEG has paid no dividends since 1973, and expects a loss this year of $300 million. **********AEG's telecommunications division makes transmission systems and radio equipment, manages all AEG's space activities and is moving into optical fiber cables. **********Bosch executives see a market developing in the 1980's for products like data banks and new forms of communications and telephone systems. Gains in these sectors, they reason, will offset any slowdown in the automobile or housing markets, where Bosch is now most vulnerable. Others Express More Caution **********But despite Bosch's successes elsewhere, some analysts of the new venture judge it cautiously. **********Most agree that the industry is headed for stirring growth. But they also predict fierce competition, citing, in West Germany alone, Siemens, the country's largest electrical company, which has a strong and profitable telecommunications division, and Standard Elektrik Lorenz, the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation's West German subsidiary. **********''In the weight of the financial investment and in the framework of our corporate policy, this decision is comparable to Bosch's development in the 1920's,'' Mr. Losten said. **********Analysts tend to agree, but they add that it may also be Bosch's biggest risk since that time. In the words of one bank's analyst, who asked not be named because of business relations: ''It's certainly one of their biggest opportunities in a long while. But it is also, no doubt, one of their major risks.'' Recession Begins to Bite **********A continuing slump in Europe's auto industry and a serious housing crisis are already taking a toll on Bosch. Net income slipped last year, the most recent period for which figures are available, to $64.7 million from $82.5 million in 1979, although revenues rose to $4.26 billion from $3.92 billion. **********Bosch's ability to invest so much capital - the venture is expected to cost the company at least $225 million - is very much a result of the way the company is run. **********When Robert Bosch, the founder, died in 1942 at the age of 81, he left instructions for a system of ownership that keeps 90 percent of the company's assets, but no voting rights, in the hands of a philanthropic foundation, and leaves policy making to Bosch management. That meant, for example, that only a quarter of last year's earnings were paid out as a dividend, while the rest flowed into Bosch's reserves. Founder's Strong Pesonality **********Mr. Bosch is described as having been an exceptionally dedicated, remarkably independent man with strong personal convictions, who once dared give a job to the former mayor of Leipzig after the official had been cast out of office for opposing Hitler. **********Mr. Bosch has had only two successors. The current chairman, Hans L. Merkle, who will be 69 in January and shows no sign of stepping down, is described as a man who only reluctantly talks to reporters.  Press officials at Bosch distribute instead a policy speech Mr.  Merkle made nearly 10 years ago. In principle, they proudly note, little has changed. **********Bosch is no newcomer to diversification. In the 1920's, Mr. Bosch tried his company's hand at products like power tools, expanding later into home appliances, heating systems and camera and movie equipment. In 1929 he entered a venture called Fernseh, an early experimenter in television. **********There have been slips. Two ventures in the postwar years, one in office machinery and another in housing, fell flat when Bosch misjudged the market. Broad Geographical Spread **********But diversification has not been Bosch's only source of growth; geographical spread has been another. **********Bosch went to Japan to seek customers for automobile magneto starters in 1911. Last year, Bosch sold $22 million worth of products in Japan, including power tools, appliances and packaging machines.  Bosch also supplied the auto industry with fuel injection systems built at a Bosch plant and under license. **********Bosch re-entered North America, which had accounted for 70 percent of sales before expropriations of plants and trade names during the two world wars, in a big way in the 1970's. Among other activities, Bosch began producing fuel injection systems in South Carolina, paid $62.9 million for a 9.3 percent share of the Borg-Warner Corporation and acquired a 25 percent share of American Microsystems Inc., a components maker. **********The company has also expanded its auto parts business and moved into power tools. Last year, sales in the United States totaled $300 million. Bosch expects to invest $40 million in the United States over the next five years, expanding revenues to $500 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/28/business/lease-fee-rises-asked.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lease Fee Rises Asked", "print_headline": "Lease Fee Rises Asked", "body_text": " **********Fees to participate in the Government's popular oil and gas leasing lotteries would triple under a proposal announced today by Interior Secretary James G.

Waters Jr. a vice president of General Motors in charge of its overseas group, joined Toshi Okamo@to, president of Isuzu Motors, and Osamu Suzuki, Suzuki Motors president, in announcing the agreement. **********The companies hope to gain an edge in the increasingly competive market for small, fuel-efficient cars with an engine displacement of 1,000 cubic centimeters and under. The agreement provides for each of the three companies to acquire shares in the other companies and to offer mutual technological and marketing assistance. **********Isuzu Started Talks **********Mr. Okamoto initiated the negotiations with Suzuki, and broached the proposal to G.M. when its chairman, Roger B. Smith, visited Tokyo last month. The final details were decided after Mr. Suzuki and Mr.  Okamoto visited the General Motors corporate offices in Detroit recently, Mr. Okamoto said. **********In a statement released today, Mr. Smith said, ''As a leading producer of vehicles smaller than any G.M. manufactures, Suzuki offers products and production capacity which can be of interest in many parts of G.M.'s worldwide marketing network, and G.M. has technology in many fields which is of interest to Suzuki.'' **********The mini-car is Suzuki's field of expertise. It also produces minitrucks, motorcycles, marine outboard motors and generator sets.  Auto makers expect worldwide demand for mini-cars to grow rapidly as oil prices continue to climb and consumers seek gas-saving vehicles for use in town or for short-distance commuting. Smaller Than Chevette **********In Japan, the mini-car designation is given to cars that are less than 126 inches long and 55.1 inches wide and have an engine displacement under 550 cubic centimeters. By contrast, the Chevette is 161.9 inches long and 61.8 inches wide and has a 1,600-cubic-centimeter engine. **********Analysts here predict that G.M. will use the engineering technology of the two companies to produce engines for its planned ''S''-car models, a tiny car that G.M. plans to build in Spain. Production of the ''S'' cars has been delayed because of cost and engineering difficulties in developing the smaller-size engines, analysts say. **********General Motors will acquire a 5 percent equity of 14 million shares in Suzuki, a major manufacturer of mini-cars and motorcycles for the Japanese domestic market. General Motors already owns a 34.2 percent share in Isuzu Motors, Japan's third-largest truck manufacturer. Stock Agreement **********Isuzu Motors will purchase 10 million shares of stock in Suzuki Motors, acquiring a 4 percent equity in that company. Suzuki Motors will also purchase 10 million shares of stock in Isuzu Motors. **********The agreement also provides an option by which G.M. and Suzuki may make mutual supply and resale arrangements for both vehicles and components, an option that Mr. Waters today termed ''a clear possibility.'' **********Executives of Suzuki and Isuzu also said they looked forward to technological and marketing gains from the agreement to cooperate.  Isuzu, which, like G.M., does not now manufacture mini-cars or trucks, can learn from Suzuki's mini-car manufacturing technology and profit by sharing its extensive domestic marketing network, Mr.  Okamoto said. Sales Gain for Suzuki **********The popularity of Suzuki's highly fuel efficient 1,000-cubiccentimeter Alto mini-car model helped push Suzuki to No.4 in sales among Japan's domestic car makers over the past two years. **********In turn, Suzuki can gain assistance from G.M. and Isuzu in its bid to develop an ''internationally acceptable'' economy car designed for the international - primarily American - market, Mr. Suzuki said. With technological assistance from General Motors in the fields of safety and emission standards, Suzuki can meet the demands of the United States market. In addition, the terms of the agreement provide for G.M. to resell Suzuki's current and future products through its overseas sales network. Isuzu and Suzuki will also cooperate in product development, production and sale. **********G.M. did not say when the vehicle supply and distribution arrangements with Suzuki would take effect, nor did it say where or when a mini-car supplied by Suzuki would be sold. **********Last May, Isuzu reached agreement with Yanase & Company, Japan's leading distributor of imported autos, to market General Motors' ''J'' cars and Isuzu's domestic car models."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/11/business/credit-markets-most-interest-rates-off-slightly-fed-funds-rise-slows-buying.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1981-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 856, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Most Interest Rates Off Slightly; Fed Funds Rise Slows Buying", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Most Interest Rates Off Slightly; Fed Funds Rise Slows Buying", "body_text": " **********Interest rates declined in early trading yesterday, but uncertainty about their future direction was so great that much of the decline was erased before trading ended. **********''The idea that interest rates will trend lower is entrenched enough so that there is a small undercurrent of buyers,'' one government securities dealer said. He quickly added, however, that the temporary gains early yesterday were the result of speculative purchases and not broad-based institutional buying. **********Traders and speculators said they were more willing to buy yesterday because financing costs - measured by overnight repurchase agreements with Treasury securities as collateral -dropped to 16 1/4 percent from over 18 percent earlier this week and over 20 percent last Friday. **********Their enthusiasm waned, however, when the rate on overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market climbed to an unexpected 22 percent during the afternoon. After opening at 17 3/4 percent, the funds rate had earlier dropped to 16 percent, a move that some traders took as a sign that the long-awaited decline in the funds rate was under way. The rates for Federal funds and repurchase agreements are not identical, but usually a change in the funds rate leads traders to expect similar adjustments in other short-term instruments, including repurchase agreements. Erratic on Wednesday **********Other analysts noted that daily fluctuations in the funds rate are a poor indicator of future rates, especially on a Wednesday, when the funds rate is erratic because it is the last day of the bank statement week. **********The future course of the Federal funds rate, which lately has been guiding all segments of the credit markets, will be determined by money supply growth, analysts explain. If money supply growth is slow and within the Fed's target, as it has been during May, then the Fed will be able to supply reserves more liberally to the banking system and the funds rate will fall. If money supply growth is rapid, then the Fed will make reserves scarcer, and the funds rate could rise, or stay at the current level. **********Forecasts of future money supply growth vary widely. Willaim N.  Griggs, an economist at J. Henry Schroder Bank and Trust Company, says that ''the risks are clearly on the side of actual M-1B and M-2 growth being near the high end rather than the low end of the Fed's annual range by December 1981.'' **********Robert Ried, an economist at McCarthy, Ried, Crisanti & Maffei Inc., has a similar forecast and concludes that ''Federal Reserve officials are in trouble. Consequently, so are the fixed income markets.'' He said that money market rates might drop to the midteens in the third quarter before rising to the high teens or low twenties by year-end. **********One of those expecting slower money supply growth and lower interest rates is Allen Sinai, an economist with Data Resources Inc., who estimates that the Federal funds rate could be 13 1/2-14 percent by August, with long-term bond yields declining two percentage points or more by then. To support his projections, he cites ''the reversed momentum for the economy, decelerating inflation, the emerging slow pace of monetary growth, a strong dollar, and diminishing credit demands.'' **********Despite the disappointment due to the afternoon increase in the funds rate, short-term interst rates remain well below the levels of late last week, and many traders continue to expect declines in the near future. Large negotiable bank certificates of deposit due in one and three months, for example, were bid early yesterday at about 17 1/2 percent and 16 1/2 percent, down a percentage point from last Friday. Treasury Announces Note Sale **********The Treasury announced plans yesterday to sell $4.25 billion of new two-year notes on June 18 and $3.25 billion of four-year notes on June 23. The financings will raise about $2.34 billion of new cash for the Treasury. **********In advance of those auctions, the outstanding 15 5/8 percent notes due in two years were offered at 102 6/32 to yield 14.3 percent and the 13 3/8 percent notes due in March 1985 were offered at 98 11/32 to yield 13.93 percent. **********In the long-term bond market, prices closed slightly higher, with the bellwether 13 7/8 percent Treasury issue due 2011 offered at 107 7/8 to yield 12.82 percent. The new Aaa-rated Shell Oil 14 1/4 percent debentures due 2011 were offered at 100 1/4, up from 100 originally. **********Elsewhere in the corporate market, underwriters led by Morgan Stanley said General Motors Acceptance Corporation's AAA-rated, 14 5/8 percent notes due 1989 will go on sale today at 99.65 to yield 14.7 percent. **********In the tax-exempt market, underwriters led by Merrill Lynch reoffered Maryland's Aaa-rated notes with yields ranging from 8 percent in 1984 to 9.2 percent in 1993, with no public reoffering of bonds due 1994-96. As expected, the issue carried higher yields than like-rated North Carolina bonds offered earlier in the week to yield from 7.5 percent in 1982 to 8.7 percent in 1991 and 9.6 percent in 1999."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/23/business/pillsbury-net-off.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 46, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pillsbury Net Off", "print_headline": "Pillsbury Net Off", "body_text": " **********The Pillsbury Company, a major producer of convenience foods and food mixes, reported yesterday that net income in the first fiscal quarter fell 12.9 percent, to $25 million, or $1.16 a share, from $28.7 million, or $1.43 a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/04/business/advertising-ad-revenues-increased-in-us-daily-newspapers.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Ad Revenues Increased In U.S. Daily Newspapers", "print_headline": "Advertising; Ad Revenues Increased In U.S. Daily Newspapers", "body_text": " **********The country's daily newspapers were up an estimated 15.6 percent in ad revenues during the first four months of this year, to $5.36 billion, compared with the same period last year, while magazines belonging to the Publishers Information Bureau were up 6 percent, to $966.1 million. **********The Newspaper Advertising Bureau, releasing the data collected by Media Records, showed that April revenues were up 23.7 percent, with the national category showing the best gains, 26.9 percent.

They include supporters of the late Shah, opponents of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and members of many religious and ethnic minority groups. **********Grand Jury Investigation **********The officials said that a grand jury, to be convened here this summer, would focus on two tactics tried by many Iranians: the use of counterfeit documents to show a close family relationship to citizens or permanent residents of the United States, and the incorporation of American businesses purporting to be subsidiaries of Iranian companies. **********Both tactics enabled Iranians to get green cards, which give foreigners many of the rights of citizens. After living in this country for five years, permanent resident aliens are eligible to become naturalized citizens. **********Federal agents have been scrutinizing the activities of Shams Javid, a 47-year-old Iranian-American whom they described as a target of the investigation. In a two-hour interview at a restaurant near his home in Falls Church, Va., Mr. Javid said that Federal agents ''were constantly there at my house'' and had interrogated many Iranians whom he had advised on immigration matters. **********Mr. Javid is not a lawyer, but said he had helped Iranians fill out immigration forms.

Indirect Payments Suspected **********Sources close to the investigation said the investigators believed that some Iranians had paid immigration service employees indirectly, through intermediaries who ''laundered'' the money. **********The investigation to date has concentrated on the Washington district office of the immigration service, which serves the District of Columbia and Virginia, but it may be extended to other offices. **********Investigators said that to obtain green cards, some Iranians had submitted counterfeit birth certificates and marriage certificates to establish that they were related to citizens or permanent resident aliens. In some cases, the officials said, the documents were not birth or marriage records, but copies of pages from law books written in Persian. **********Immigration examiners are supposed to obtain translations of documents written in a foreign language, but even so, Government lawyers said, it might be difficult to prove criminal intent rather than negligence by immigration service employees in such cases. Fraud Said to Continue **********Law-enforcement officials said that the fraud was apparently continuing, but that the immigration service had put into effect controls to prevent the issuance of green cards to ineligible applicants. So far, no employees have been dismissed or reassigned. **********The investigation of Iranian immigration cases overlaps, but is separate from, the work of a Federal grand jury that has been investigating charges of immigration fraud for the last 18 months.

''This is the most significant consumer electronics product since color television,'' declared Herbert S. Schlosser, executive vice president. At least RCA, which brought out color television in 1954, is hoping it will be. **********RCA's videodisk system will be the second to reach the market.

Some industry analysts think consumers will be too confused by the three incompatible systems - none of them will be able to play disks made for the other two - or will prefer the video cassette recorder, which, while more expensive than the disk player, can tape programs off the air as well as play prerecorded material. **********''RCA seems to think of this thing as a toaster,'' said Anthony M.

Most consumers still do not know what a videodisk is. RCA's advertising barrage should change that. And the marketing battle will begin in earnest. **********RCA's advertising campaign is expected to easily sell out its immediately available players and result in the sales of competing systems. Indeed, some analysts suggest that RCA may educate the public about videodisks only to have its competitors win the market. **********But RCA is confident. ''I don't think there will be a dogfight at all,'' said Roy H. Pollack, executive vice president. Development Cost $150 Million **********For RCA, which has spent more than 15 years and $150 million developing the videodisk system, the project is of crucial importance. **********The company has been beset by management shake-ups - the most recent being the sudden announcement a month ago that its chairman, Edgar H. Griffiths, would resign in July - and the company is now attempting to consolidate its diversified operations into a few lines of business. The videodisk is a morale booster and a return to the company's traditional stronghold of consumer electronics. **********RCA's product has fewer features than the two competing systems. It is designed to have a low price - $500 -and attract the average consumer, not the gadget-minded. **********''Our program is aimed, with a rifle, at the consumer,'' Mr.  Pollack said.  The Magnavox-U.S. Pioneer product, which was developed by MCA Inc.  and the Dutch company N.V. Philips, boasts several features, such as the ability to find and display any single frame and to go forward and backward in slow motion. But the players sell for $750 to $800, while most of the disks sell for about $25. **********The third product, expected to be introduced later this year, will seek the low price of the RCA system with many of the special features offered by the other system. Japanese Competition **********It was developed by the Victor Company of Japan (JVC) and will be marketed by JVC; its parent company, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, which sells under the names Panasonic and Quasar, and by the General Electric Company. **********In principle, the videodisk system works like a phonograph in that signals are picked off a rotating disk. But since many more signals must be picked up to convey a picture in addition to sound, the traditional phonograph needle wiggling in a groove cannot work. The videodisks spin at 450 to 1,800 revolutions a minute compared with only 33.3 for a phonograph. **********RCA's system uses a stylus that moves in grooves so narrow that 38 of them can fit into a single groove on an audio record.  The JVC system uses a stylus that glides along the disk without grooves. The Philips-MCA system uses a laser to read the information on the spinning disk without touching the disk at all. **********So far, it is estimated that perhaps 25,000 of the laser players have been sold in two years, as many as RCA plans to have on its dealers' shelves next month. Product Introduced Gradually **********Magnavox introduced the product in a few cities at a time starting in late 1978 and did not achieve national distribution until last November. **********Disks were in short supply and many proved defective. The disks contained a half hour of programming per side, meaning a feature film required two disks. **********''The effort has been pathetic,'' said James Magid, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin.  RCA says it is determined to do better. It will start the product nationwide and has lined up allies that, with RCA, account for nearly 60 percent of color television sales in the United States. They include the Zenith Radio Corporation; three Japanese companies, Toshiba, Hitachi and Sanyo, as well as Sears, Montgomery Ward, J.C.  Penney and Radio Shack. The Columbia Broadcasting System will eventually make its own disks. If the RCA system becomes the industry standard, these allies, in effect, will wind up competing with RCA. **********RCA also has developed a disk catalogue of 100 titles and says it will introduce 50 more by August. The catalogue is heavily tilted toward feature movies - from ''The Absent-Minded Professor'' to ''The Godfather'' - with some sports, television shows, music, culture and educational material. **********Finally, RCA will advertise far more heavily. Its commercials will tempt consumers with the prospect of John Travolta dancing in their living rooms and the Godfather coming to dinner. RCA Ads Will Help Others **********The laser forces, meanwhile, which advertise their product as ''gourmet video,'' have taken steps to improve marketing and disk production. They now have disks that can play an hour on each side, but at the expense of some features. RCA's advertising is expected to help this product also. **********John C. Messerschmitt, vice president of North American Philips, said that the RCA promotion is ''the greatest thing that can happen to LaserVision. As soon as people understand what the videodisk is, then we get them.'' **********With a combination of advanced features and a low price, the JVC system could be a powerful contender, especially since Matsushita is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. But with the product's introduction less than a year away, the group has not signed up any programs to put on its disks and some analysts wonder how serious the consortium is. Video Cassette Sales Rise **********Meanwhile, video cassette recorders, which have been sold since 1975, seemed suddenly to catch on last year, when sales rose 69 percent, to 800,000 units, from sales in 1979. **********The tape players range from $600 to more than $1,000 and prerecorded tapes cost $45 to $80, more than twice as much as disks.  But consumers can rent tapes and can tape their own programs to cut costs. **********Ultimately, the fate of the various competitors and of the budding industry in general, is likely to depend on whether the videodisk can offer a service not provided by movies, cable television and other entertainment media. That depends on the development of programs specifically for the disk. **********''Feature films will be the locomotive that gets the industry started and pulls it along,'' said Mr. Schlosser of RCA. ''But Hollywood comes out with only 15 to 20 hits a year. That's not enough to sustain a disk industry.'' **********One big area will be musical disks in which the performer can be seen as well as heard. By 1982, all systems on the market will be able to play stereo. The disks could also provide programming for a small audience spread across the country, much as magazines now do. A Giant Storage System **********Perhaps the biggest potential lies, however, in taking advantage of two features that the optical, or laser, system has - the ability to find and display a single frame. **********With 54,000 individual frames on one side, the disk becomes a giant file for storing photographs and text as well as moving pictures.  Soon disks will also be used to store computer data. **********Moreover, the disk players can be programmed by a computer to play the frames in any order desired. For example, a computerized disk program used for teaching can quiz the viewer and keep score, and automatically repeat certain segments if a question is answered incorrectly. The General Motors Corporation uses the disks to train mechanics and salesmen and for customer presentations in its showroom."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/26/world/hijackers-of-turkish-jet-overpowered-in-bulgaria-and-91-hostages-freed.html": {"writer_name": "Marvine Howe", "pub_date": "1981-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 717, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HIJACKERS OF TURKISH JET OVERPOWERED IN BULGARIA AND 91 HOSTAGES FREED", "print_headline": "HIJACKERS OF TURKISH JET OVERPOWERED IN BULGARIA AND 91 HOSTAGES FREED", "body_text": " **********Turkey, saying that it had shown that terrorism must be ''confronted decisively,'' announced today that four terrorists who yesterday hijacked a Turkish airliner to Bulgaria had been captured and all of the hostages freed. **********It was reported that a total of 91 passengers and crew members were aboard the plane when it was recaptured. Five of the passengers were American executives of Citibank. **********The Turkish state radio said tonight that the hijackers, who have been identified as ''leftist extremists,'' were seized after a struggle during which five of the passengers were wounded and one terrorist seriously hurt. Later it was reported that two of the five injured passengers were in serious condition with wounds suffered during the recapture of the aircraft. **********There were varying accounts of the capture of the hijackers, but there seemed to be general agreement that some of the terrorists were overpowered by passengers and crew members who attacked them aboard the plane, while others were detained by Bulgarian security forces on the ground. **********Turkish authorities identified two of the four terrorists as members of the Dev Sol, or Revolutionary Left. Black Sea Resort **********The rescue operation occurred in the Bulgarian Black Sea resort of Burgas. The hijackers had said that if their demands were not met, they would kill the five Citibank officials, then blow up the plane with the rest of the passengers. They were asking for the release of 47 prisoners in Turkey and $500,000. **********''Our Government has given an example by showing that terror must be confronted decisively,'' the Turkish Prime Minister, Adm. Bulend Ulusu, said tonight, expressing satisfaction over ''the happy conclusion of the hijacking.'' **********The Prime Minister's office expressed appreciation for ''the close and efficient cooperation'' shown by the Bulgarian authorities during the hijacking incident. The Turkish head of state, Gen. Kenan Evren, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister sent telegrams of thanks to their Bulgarian counterparts. **********It was the fourth Turkish airliner hijacked to Bulgaria since 1969. All of the incidents ended without fatalities. Once the Bulgarians returned a hijacker to Turkey because he was found to be insane and on the two other occasions, the hostages were freed and the hijackers were given political asylum in Bulgaria. Hijackers Lured Off Plane **********According to Bulgarian news agency reports received here, Bulgarian security officials lured two of the hijackers off the aircraft with the promise to let them hold a news conference and detained them immediately. **********The agency said that at the same time inside the plane, the passengers overpowered one of the hijackers and seized his gun. He tried to escape by jumping out of the rear door but was captured by the Bulgarian security services. The other hijacker reportedly began firing indiscriminately, wounding several passengers. He was seriously injured himself in the struggle. **********The entire operation took 45 minutes, the Bulgarian news agency said.  Another version was given tonight by Turkish state radio correspondents who were also present. Plan to Capture Terrorists **********According to this version, the Turkish crew of the hijacked DC-9 worked out a secret plan with the passengers for the capture of the terrorists. As part of this plan, the pilot moved the plane up from its isolated position and parked near the air terminal at 2:20 P.M.  Later the pilot moved the plane again and came to an abrupt halt, throwing the hijackers off balance. The passengers then attacked their captors. Two tried to escape but were seized when they got out of the plane. In the scuffle that ensued, one of the hijackers was seriously wounded and five passengers - two Turks, two Japanese and an Iranian - were injured. The wounded passengers were taken at once to a Bulgarian hospital for treatment. **********A special Turkish aircraft was sent to Burgas late this afternoon and they were flown back to Istanbul tonight.  The Turkish airliner took off from Istanbul's Yesilkoy Airport at 7 A.M. yesterday on a domestic flight to Ankara. Shortly afterward, gunmen forced the pilot to change his course and fly to Burgas. There were 110 passengers, mostly Turkish citizens, and 8 crew members aboard the aircraft."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/07/business/british-money-growth-slows.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Money Growth Slows", "print_headline": "British Money Growth Slows", "body_text": " **********The growth in the British money supply slowed in December, the Bank of England announced today. **********The bank said money supply grew about five-tenths of 1 percent, compared with rises of 2 percent in each of the previous two months.

The impetus for this trend has come from the students themselves rather than from college administrations. **********''It might not loom large yet, but the taking of double majors has been increasing,'' J. Paul Hunter, dean of the College of Arts and Science at the University of Rochester, said last week. It is a trend he hopes to encourage, he added. **********''I think it is a good trend - a trend of the future,'' said Angel G. Jordan, dean of the Carnegie Institute of Technology at Carnegie Mellon University. **********Engineering students, he added, have more difficulty with double majors than liberal arts students because of crowded schedules that allow few electives. But they are combining such majors as chemical engineering with English, economics or other subjects that can help an engineer. **********Career problems await a typical liberal arts major who focuses on history, classics, English or languages. Looking ahead, he or she realizes that upon graduation the best job opportunities will go to students with majors in such areas as engineering, physics, chemistry, geology and computer science. **********A study by Fox-Morris Associates, personnel consultants, finds that a typical liberal arts graduate earns $14,530 a year in the first job, compared with $19,400 for a computer science major and more than $21,000 for an engineer. **********What to do? A graduate degree in law or business administration is a possibility. But many liberal arts graduates cannot afford to go on to a professional school immediately or they want a breather, so they work a while before studying for an advanced degree. **********Taking a double major in two disparate subjects enables the student to knock at more than one door to the job market. **********Some music majors, knowing the difficulty of finding good jobs in their field, are also majoring in mathematics and computer science because computer jobs abound. **********Economics majors might add a language major, making them extra useful to a multinational company.  Some majors reinforce each other. English students, for instance, can also take majors in geology, physics or biology. Such double majors could lead to a job as a technical writer or editor. **********At the University of Rochester, Dean Hunter estimated that 21 to 23 percent of the students in the College of Arts and Science chose double majors in the last four years, compared with 13 percent in 1972 and 7 percent in 1970. He said 142 of the 654 students who received degrees last spring had double majors, compared with 137 of 664 in the class of 1978 and only 48 of 651 in 1970. Among the double-major combinations were microbiology and philosophy, physics and religion and nursing and art. **********At Pennsylvania State University, John J. Romano, associate dean of the College of Liberal Arts, said double majors had held fairly steady during the last five years at about 8 percent of the graduating class. **********''They really took off about five years ago,'' he said yesterday.  ''When I talk to the freshman class, I try to push the taking of multiple majors.'' One unusual double major, he said, was East Asian studies and mineral economics. **********On some campuses, especially at major liberal arts colleges, taking a double major is almost impossible because so wide a spectrum of basic courses is required. **********Why do some colleges discourage double majors? They take more faculty advising time, and perhaps academic conservatism is a factor. Instead, many liberal arts colleges stress an interdisciplinary approach or use of a strong minor. **********Sometimes a student working for a double major has to take extra courses, especially if one of the fields is a science. The requirements for a major in biology, for example, may include both general and organic chemistry, physics and mathematics, as well as biology courses. **********Two majors with less demanding requirements - English and economics, say - would probably be less rigorous.  Nevin Murtha, a 20-year-old junior in the Newark College of Arts and Sciences at Rutgers University, is working on a double major in geology and history. He approached this program from an unusual perspective. **********After taking a high school course in geology, Mr. Murtha decided to study that subject in college and eventually earn a master's degree in geology. In his freshman year he happened to take American history and liked that, too. ''I did well in it,'' Mr. Murtha said last week. ''I had a knack, and I even thought of switching my major.'' But he remembered that geology offers better job opportunities. **********''Jobs for teachers in the history field are very tight, so I stuck with geology,'' he said. ''I don't know about the trend, but I do know a fair number of people who are doing double majors.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/18/business/economic-scene-what-reagan-will-propose.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1981-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 796, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; What Reagan Will Propose", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; What Reagan Will Propose", "body_text": " **********PRESIDENT REAGAN will lay out his economic plan for stopping inflation and revitalizing the American economy tonight. The American people, according to the White House press secretary, James S. Brady, will be told they have ''no choice'' but to support ''our plan.'' **********The White House has mounted the biggest public relations campaign in memory to sell an economic program - replete with briefing sessions for influential legislators, businessmen and news media representatives, television appearances by Cabinet officers and economic aides and masses of data to augment the President's own message. **********Indeed, so huge is the publicity blitz that Mr. Brady has begun to worry about overkill. ''We don't want to turn this into a MEGO - My Eyes Glaze Over,'' he said. **********But boredom would appear to be the last thing the Administration has to worry about. Virtually everyone is opposed to some specific aspects of the President's program - including the leaders of organized labor; dairy farmers; the medical profession; urban mayors; blacks; people on welfare; champions of the arts, the humanities, the sciences and social sciences; environmentalists; the Pentagon; the poor and the near-poor who are afraid of losing their food stamps or jobs or unemployment compensation, and the rich and near-rich who have been hoping for bigger and prompter tax cuts on their earned or unearned income. **********The plan has four major elements, much of which has already leaked: **********- Reductions in Federal spending. President Reagan will propose budget cuts of $13.5 billion in the current fiscal year, chops as high as $53 billion in the fiscal year 1982, about $80 billion in the fiscal 1983 and an average of $130 billion in the fiscal years 1984 through 1986. These cuts are even larger than Mr. Reagan proposed during the election campaign. Some observers attribute the depth of the proposed cuts to the zealotry of David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget. Others believe that the President wanted to confront the nation with the biggest possible shopping list of budget cuts, which could be used for bargaining with Congress. The huge proposed spending cuts will also enable the President to look more fiscally responsible as he moves slowly toward a balanced budget. **********- Cuts in business and personal income taxes. The President has been trimming his tax-cut proposals to avoid worsening future budget deficits. He will delay the start of the first year's installment of three annual 10 percent tax cuts until July 1 and shave proposed tax cuts for upper-income taxpayers. But he has apparently decided to make depreciation write-offs for business investment more generous, substituting a modified version of the 10-5-3 plan for the Senate Finance Committee plan that would have shortened the ''useful lives'' of plant and equipment by about 40 percent. Under the new Reagan plan, in which write-offs would be phased in over five years retroactive to Jan. 1, 1981, plants, warehouses and other nonresidential buildings could be written off in 10 years and residential properties in 15 to 18 years; new machinery could be written off in five years and vehicles in three years. The President seems to have bought the arguments of those who wanted the tax-cut package weighted more heavily toward productivity-increasing investments. **********- Deregulation and regulatory reform. The President has already started down this path with the decontrol of oil and gasoline prices ahead of former President Jimmy Carter's schedule. The jump in gasoline prices, despite reports of gluts in supply, has exceeded the Administration's expectations and may, paradoxically, help build support for his anti-inflation budget cuts. Some of the effort to cut regulation will take the form of chopping funds and personnel of the regulatory agencies. **********- Stabilization of the country's monetary system. The cutting edge of the Administration's anti-inflation program still appears to be the monetary restraints administered by the Federal Reserve. High interest rates seem likely to persist despite widespread howls of anguish. **********Reaganomics is emerging as a blend of supply-side radicalism and demand-side conservatism; the danger is that the economy will garner neither the dynamic expansion promised by the supply-siders nor the anti-inflationary impact promised by the old-line conservatives, budget balancers and monetarists. **********Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, says that ''the standard Keynesian model will not get the results on economic growth or bringing down the rate of inflation that we are showing'' by using ''a supply-side model.'' **********Whether the public, business, the stock market or the economics fraternity will accept the new supply-side model or reject it remains to be seen. Certainly, the big battles over the ultimate shape of President Reagan's anti-inflation and revitalization program lie ahead, in Congress and in the nation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/27/business/earnings-firestone-posts-net-of-27-million.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1981-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 314, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FIRESTONE POSTS NET OF $27 MILLION", "print_headline": "EARNINGS; FIRESTONE POSTS NET OF $27 MILLION", "body_text": " **********The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, buoyed by strong gains from its tire operations in North America, reported yesterday that it had net income of $27 million in the second quarter of the fiscal year 1981, in contrast to a loss of $52 million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier.

The two departments had recommended an abstention, officials said, to narrow the gap between the United States and the 156 other nations at the United Nations' World Health Assembly. **********The leading American makers of powdered milk, Abbott Laboratories, the American Home Products Corporation and the Bristol-Myers Company, have waged a campaign for the ''no'' vote. Administration aides agreed with the manufacturers that there was no persuasive evidence of a connection between the promotion of powdered milk and a drop in breast-feeding and that the code infringes on free speech and restrains trade. In addition, Administration officials oppose any precedent for economic regulation by United Nations agencies. **********Order Said to Came From Meese **********According to one aide, the telegram instructing the United States delegation to vote ''no'' was signed by Edwin Meese 3d, counselor to President Reagan. **********The World Health Assembly includes all members of the World Health Organization, which opened its annual meeting in Geneva on May 4 and is scheduled to vote on May 21. The importance of the issue was underlined by the presence of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India, who addressed the gathering on its third day. **********The triumph of the formula industry could prove to be selfdefeating. The United States position may so outrage third-world nations that they will translate the code's recommendations into legislation. This, however, would have only a limited effect on the American companies. They sell about $500 million in powdered milk at home and $150 million abroad. But the Nestle Company of Switzerland alone accounts for about $500 million of the $1 billion in thirdworld sales. **********Aggressive promotion of powdered milk in the third world has come under fire from church and social activist groups for several years.  Their campaign has been joined and enlarged by the World Health Organization and by the United Nations Children's Fund. Acute Problem in Third World **********These groups contend that marketing of the synthetic discourages breast-feeding, which many doctors believe is both phsyiologically and psychologically far more healthy. The problem is said to be acute in Africa, Asia and Latin America, where the powder is often mixed with polluted water or left standing without refrigeration until it sours. **********Although there are no recent large-scale studies linking formulafeeding in the third world to infant disease and mortality, several samplings do indicate that breast-fed babies from the same background do have a higher rate of survival. **********Feelings have risen so high that activist groups have organized a world boycott of Nestle, the biggest formula producer in a $2 billion world market. **********The Geneva code recommends protective practices and does not have the force of a law or a treaty. But the companies contend that nations voting for it will be morally obligated to pass legislation that carries out the proposals. An All-Embracing Code **********The code, moreover, is all-embracing and would apply to wealthy industrial nations with literate populations and uncontaminated water supplies as well as to poor countries. This aspect, defended by W.H.O. and by Unicef as a reflection of the need to promote breastfeeding everywhere, makes the document more vulnerable to the industry's attack. **********The code would outlaw ''advertising or other form of promotion to the general public''; prohibit the distribution of free samples to pregnant women and health-care workers, except for testing; prohibit premiums to promote sales; bar salesmen from getting in touch with mothers; outlaw commissions on sales, and prohibit product labels that idealize infant formula. **********Most of the major producers, under the pressure of the critics, have drawn up their own codes and say they subscribe to them. These documents, however, are limited to marketing practices in the third world and do not extend to developed nations. They vary considerably. The American codes are the broadest, generally prohibiting promotion through the mass media. **********A spokesman for Bristol-Myers, Harry Levine, said that his company would continue to adhere to its own code, regardless of the vote in Geneva. ''Nothing we are doing is stopping breast-feeding,'' he said. **********In Washington, Douglas A. Johnson, chairman of the Infant Formula Action Committee, a leading crusader against powdered milk, said that an American vote against the code ''would isolate the U.S. from its allies to protect an industry that has been highly criticized for the past decade and a half.''

Individuals do not pay taxes on any of these funds until they are withdrawn, generally after retirement, at which time the withdrawals are subject to income taxes but presumably at a lower rate. **********This tax-deferred buildup to help pay for retirement is in sharp contrast to the Social Security program, which individuals support with after-tax dollars. Some observers who welcome the new greater incentive for personal savings say that it could become a basis for shrinking the Social Security program sometime in the future. **********''The Government's basic thrust is to say that people are going to have to save for themselves, to provide for their own retirement,'' Howard Stein, chairman of the Dreyfus Corporation, a money management company, said in a discussion of the new law. **********Even if a person expects to have to pay a tax rate after retirement as high as the rate paid now, tax specialists say it probably still makes sense to establish an Individual Retirement Account. That is because money in an I.R.A., as such accounts are commonly called, will compound faster than it would if taxes took a bite out of each dollar invested and each dollar earned on the investment. According to calculations by Touche Ross, an individual who put $2,000 a year into an I.R.A. each year for 20 years, earning 12 percent on the funds invested, would accumulate $160,000. Over 40 years, the sum would jump to $1.7 million. After assuming 40 years of inflation, of course, this would be worth somewhat less than it is today. **********''Even if you are only putting in small amounts now, over time, because of compounding, the sums become astronomical,'' Mr. Paul commented. At 12 percent, the sum doubles every six years. **********Despite its general appeal, an Individual Retirement Account may create something of a dilemma for workers who save in a company plan where the employer matches their contributions, perhaps putting up $1 for every $2 put up by the employee. Funds saved by employees that are matched by a company are taxable and may not count as I.R.A.  contributions, warned Deborah Marx Fishman, a partner at Kwasha Lipton, an employee-benefits consulting firm. An Individual's Decision **********''For the average employee, who does not have enough money both to establish an I.R.A. and to continue in the company savings plan, the choice of which is better is not clear-cut,'' she said. ''The tax deduction for an I.R.A. is only a temporary thing, while the company match is an outright gift, and the funds can be withdrawn sooner and without penalty.'' **********The new rules governing retirement accounts are simple. Anyone with income from wages or salaries may take up to $2,000 of that income each year and put it into a specially designated retirement account. An individual with earnings from investments - but no compensation income - would not qualify for the special tax provisions for Individual Retirement Accounts. **********The new law allows people to put as much as 100 percent of their earned income into an I.R.A., with a limit of $2,000. This means that, beginning next year, someone who earns only $2,000 and does not need that money for living expenses could put all of the $2,000 into an I.R.A. (The new tax-exempt savings certificates, which will permit individuals to exclude up to $1,000 a person in interest from the certificates beginning Oct. 1, have no connection with the I.R.A.  program and generally would not be a wise investment vehicle for an I.R.A.) Liberalization of Rules **********Previous rules governing retirement accounts kept people covered by qualified company pension plans from establishing I.R.A.'s, unless they also had sources of earned income outside their company wages.  Those who did set up an I.R.A. could put no more than 15 percent of their earned income into it, up to a limit of $1,500 a person. Now even a self-employed person with a retirement program known as a Keogh Plan can put $2,000 into an I.R.A. on top of the $15,000 he can put into the Keogh Plan. And he can deduct all $17,000 from taxable income. **********The new tax law, like the old, permits an individual with a spouse who does not hold a job to set up an additional account for the nonworking spouse, and it raises the amounts. Under the new law, the two accounts together may total as much as $2,250, and the money may be divided almost any way between the two accounts. The only restrictions are that at least $250 must be put into the account of the nonworking spouse and that neither account may receive more than $2,000 in one year. **********While these accounts - and the tax exemption - look attractive, the individual should think hard about whether he is prepared to lock away the money until at least age 59 1/2, for there is a penalty for withdrawing money before then. Not only would the saver have to pay income taxes on any money withdrawn but he also would have to pay a penalty equal to 10 percent of the sums taken out early. Leeway on Withdrawals **********''If you're making only $10,000 a year, you may have better things to do with your money than put it aside,'' John W. Hamm, a tax partner at Arthur Young & Company, suggested. **********A person with enough funds may choose not to withdraw money at 59 1/2, allowing it to continue to compound tax-free. However, withdrawals must begin by the time the individual turns 70 1/2. Money withdrawn after that point may be withdrawn all at once or gradually. If it is taken out gradually, it must be withdrawn at least as fast as a schedule that would reduce the account to zero by the time the person is expected to die. Most banks and other institutions that are custodians for such retirement accounts have actuarial tables that can be used to determine a person's life expectancy. **********Deciding where to place I.R.A. dollars can be a challenge - something like choosing from a long Chinese restaurant menu. There are relatively few constraints on how the money may be invested, but the usual tax considerations go by the wayside. An individual may set up an I.R.A. for a year's income any time until he files his income tax return for that year, meaning it can be established as late as April 15 for the previous year. Buying Insurance Barred **********The only legal prohibition is that the funds may not be used to buy life insurance. (Because money already accumulates in insurance accounts tax-free and may also escape taxation when a person dies, Congress did not want to permit yet another layer of tax deferral through an I.R.A.) The new I.R.A. rules also penalize investments in collectibles - such as diamonds, rare stamps or antiques - in such a way that collectibles are effectively prohibited. **********''A good rule of thumb is to look for the safest investment with the highest return,'' Mr. Paul recommended. ''Going for the highest yield is really the name of the game.'' **********The bulk of the money in I.R.A.'s now is in various kinds of bank deposits. But with the anticipated expansion of I.R.A.'s, brokers and mutual funds are expected to make a greater pitch for the money.  Most of these institutions have programs with simple registration forms to fill out, for creating an I.R.A. **********''We'll have a system for people to take money already in our mutual funds and move it into an I.R.A.,'' Mr. Stein of Dreyfus said. ''Why shouldn't people move money to gain the tax exemption?'' A Company Savings Plan **********Another option under the new tax law may be to place the money in a company-sponsored retirement or savings program. Then the company, rather than the individual, is responsible for investing the money.  The funds must be designated as ''qualified voluntary employee contributions'' -the equivalent of an I.R.A. account -so that the employee may deduct them from his income for tax purposes. And they may not be dollars that the employer matches as part of a company savings plan. **********The individual who decides he has made a wrong investment for his I.R.A. has some flexibility in moving the funds around. Active changes, where the individual takes his money back and places it elsewhere (known as a rollover) may be made once each year. But if an employee retains the same bank or broker or fund manager who is serving as a trustee and simply shifts the I.R.A. money from one investment to another - say from stocks to bonds - then the move does not count as a rollover. **********Investment advisers expect this to be a strong selling point for mutual funds and brokerage firms, since an individual could transfer money from a money market fund to stocks to bonds and back, all without officially touching the money. **********The individual who does move his funds from one trustee to another has up to 60 days from the time he receives the money to establish a new I.R.A. account without its being deemed a withdrawal. And there is no legal bar against splitting the I.R.A. money among several types of accounts.

But after numerous trips to Haifa, Mr. Bickford came back late last year with what is believed to be the first major longterm export contract for steam coal landed by an American coal company. **********The agreement, under which Westmoreland expects to deliver a minimum of 15.7 million metric tons of steam coal, used mostly to produce electricity, over 30 years, is viewed as a key part of the company's strategy to cope with a slowdown in its traditional markets. **********Others Looking for Exports **********Westmoreland's hopes for the export market are shared by many domestic coal companies. In fact, the Pittston Company, the Island Creek Coal Company and Armco were all battling for the contract with Israeli Electric, which is switching from oil to coal. **********''We need the security to be able to pay for our investment, as opposed to wondering every year that we might not have a market,'' said Pemberton Hutchinson, Westmoreland's president, in an interview. **********A decline in demand from overseas steel mills for metallurgical coal and reduced shipments of steam coal to domestic utilities sharply reduced Westmoreland's earnings last year. And in this year's first quarter, the company was in the red for the first time since 1961. **********''Westmoreland is struggling,'' Jack Kawa, a coal analyst for Wheat First Securities, a brokerage firm in Richmond, said. He estimated that Westmoreland would lose about $8 million to $10 million in the present quarter even if the coal strike is settled this month. **********Thus long-term contracts such as the one concluded with Israeli Electric, he added, become particularly important. The provisions to recover rapidly rising costs increase the company's ability to keep up with inflation and lessen its vulnerability to losses from lower prices on short-term contracts when the coal market is soft. Development Costs Increase **********In the past, Mr. Hutchinson noted, the company has had short-term export contracts that had to be renegotiated every year. The risk of developing new coal mines in the 1970's, when the cost was about $20 per ton a year, was not as great as now, with the price at $50 to $70 per ton a year. **********''If you have a one-year contract,'' Mr. Hutchinson observed, ''the banks are not going to lend you $100 million. If you have a long-term contract it will certainly help.'' **********Now some of those risks are haunting Westmoreland. Because the market for coal has not expanded as rapidly as the industry had expected, excess capacity has developed. **********Westmoreland, for example, has put into mothballs its Triangle Mine Complex in Eccles, W. Va., on which it had spent $21 million.  The phase-out of steel-making capacity and the severe drop in demand for steel last year have depressed the demand for metallurgical coal, used by steel companies to make coke. **********In addition, a venture in Montana on which the company has spent $80 million to develop surface mines for steam coal has also been scaled back. Originally planned for a capacity of 10 million tons a year, the mines have been producing at a rate of 5 million tons. Conservation a Factor **********Major utilities in this Western region have decided to put off expansion of power-generating plants because of reduced demand, resulting from consumer conservation. This has left Westmoreland with excess capacity. In addition the company has closed other mines to bring production more into line with demand. **********Lower coal prices and reduced shipments have cut the income of this medium-sized coal company, ranking 13th in production, from a high of $48.2 million, or $7.07 a share, in 1976, to $340,000, or 5 cents a share, last year. It reported a loss of $4.8 million for the first quarter of this year. **********Last year it sold 16 million tons of coal - 66 percent of which was steam coal - for $448 million, but lost money on its coal operations. It was able to turn in a modest profit from the recovery of deferred income taxes and the sale of a subsidiary, Virginia Birmingham Bolt Inc., which makes bolts used in mines. Five Died in Explosion **********Also Last Nov. 7 an explosion at its Ferrell Mine killed five miners, an accident that led the Virginia Department of Mines to fine Westmoreland $255,450 for violations; five of the mine supervisors were fined a total of $63,500. **********Westmoreland cannot sustain many more quarters with such sizable losses, said Mr. Kawa, the analyst.  One of the few bright spots for the company, therefore, was the surge in steam coal exports and the long-term contract with the Israelis. **********Westmoreland was eager to find long-term export business to provide a market for some of its excess capacity and lessen the risk of developing new mines. **********The company's effort focused on countries where it felt it might have an advantage over its competitors. ''You can't shotgun shoot the whole world market,'' Mr. Hutchinson said. A Key Advantage **********Westmoreland offers a major advantage in the battle for export markets: It is an independent coal company, **********This is important to customers concerned about an involvement with coal companies that are subsidiaries of oil companies. Two such companies are the Consolidation Coal Company, a subsidiary of Conoco, and the Island Creek Coal Company, a subsidiary of the Occidental Petroleum Company. **********Some executives involved in talks with delegations from overseas utilties noted that there was concern about a possible conflict of interest, in which a company might hold back on the development of coal if its oil sales started to decline. **********Even with such an advantage, Westmoreland faces a serious hurdle: port congestion. It is an important point, since Westmoreland insisted in its bargaining that it would not be responsible for demurrage costs incurred for loading delays. **********The company stressed, however, that it had joined with Armco, Ashland Coal and Utah International to develop a coal export terminal at Newport News, Va., the nation's largest coal port. **********Mr. Hutchinson said that the company was seeking diversified customers, particularly in export markets, which promise more rapid growth. **********The company is meeting with delegations from South Korea and Japan to discuss long-term agreements for steam coal.  Most European countries, which have been largely responsible for the surge in exports of American steam coal, have adopted a waitand-see attitude. **********They are willing to negotiate short one- to three-year contracts to see whether the port congestion will ease and what the long-range effects of the coal strike will be."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/10/business/chrysler-tank-unit-stirs-buyer-interest.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1981-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 441, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHRYSLER TANK UNIT STIRS BUYER INTEREST", "print_headline": "CHRYSLER TANK UNIT STIRS BUYER INTEREST", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation said today that several companies had ''expressed an interest'' in buying Chrysler Defense Inc., the subsidiary that makes tanks for the Army. **********Chrysler said, in a terse announcement, that it had provided information about the subsidiary to the unnamed companies and that representatives of the potential buyers had toured the tank plants in Lima, Ohio, and Warren, Mich.

Others, including Denmark and Canada, have lagged. Canada, regarded by European members as a country rich in resources, spent only 1.7 percent of its gross national product on defense in 1979. **********Although a Soviet threat to the oil resources of the Persian Gulf has been recognized for more than a year, American officials believe that this was the first defense meeting at which European members had faced the related questions of what they could do to assist American deployment in Southwest Asia and what they would have to do if that deployment cut into the reinforcements earmarked for Europe. **********''There was no disagreement,'' Mr. Weinberger said. ''NATO is very concerned.'' The alliance's first step in the event of a threat to the oilfields would be to consult on the nature of the threat ''in order to deter aggression and to respond to requests from other nations for help in resisting threats to their security or independence,'' the statement said. Statement Falls Short of U.S. Aims **********The defense ministers, it continued, recognized that common objectives identified in their consultations ''may require members of the alliance to facilitate out-of-area deployments in support of the vital interests of all.'' **********This statement falls well short of what the United States seeks, military sources said. Greece, Italy and West Germany are wary about granting port facilities or overflight rights for troops or equipment of the rapid deployment force moving to Southwest Asia. Mr.  Weinberger, who flew to Lisbon this afternoon, is expected to sound the Portuguese Government about its attitude to these issues. **********An important issue for NATO's European members is the impact on defense planning in the case of American intervention in Southwest Asia or elsewhere. This, the statement noted, ''could involve possible changes in the availability of combat and support forces currently committed to NATO'' as reinforcements. The communique said that Europe, in that case, should also maintain and strengthen its ability to deter aggression. **********Whether this is probable is remote. Military sources stress that the thin crust of allied forces in West Germany cannot be appreciably strengthened in current economic conditions. **********However, the defense ministers agreed that military planning should provide for changes in the availability of forces assigned to NATO because of national operations outside the alliance's boundaries in support of the allies' vital interests."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/17/business/umc-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UMC INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "UMC INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/05/business/briefs-029026.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 382, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** The Bacock and Wilcox Tubular Group of McDermott Inc. said it intended to divest itself of its fittings and forging operations in Koppel, Pa. and Elkhart, Ind. *********** Beech Aircraft Corporation, a unit of Raytheon Corporation, received an $8.5 million contract from the Army for the production of six Beechcraft C-12D twin-engine utility aircraft. *********** Brady Energy Corporation announced a joint venture agreement with Denison Mines Ltd. of Toronto, providing for the joint leasing of properties deemed suitable for oil and gas exploration. *********** Echo Bay Mines Ltd., a Canadian subsidiary of IU International Corporation, established a $35 million credit facility with Royal Bank of Canada. *********** Compugraphic Corporation agreed to aquire One Systems, a subsidiary of Howard Publications, for an undisclosed price. *********** Elcor Corporation said its Ortloff Corporation subsidiary was awarded a $9 million contract by Chevron U.S.A. to design and construct the Judge Digby Gas Treating Plant in Point Coupee Parish, La. *********** Harley Corporation agreed to sell its corrugated products plant in Spartanburg, S.C., to Georgia-Pacific Corporation for about $3 million. *********** Helmerich & Payne Inc. has contracted for the construction of four land drilling rigs and an offshore platform rig worth a total of $38 million, to be delivered after October of this year. *********** King's Department Stores Inc. agreed to sell its Franklin Stores division to Petrie Stores Corporation, for an undisclosed price. *********** Mitel Corporation received a $19.5 million order from North Supply Co. of Lenoxa, Kan., for switching systems. *********** Nucorp Energy Inc. intends to purchase Allied Pipe and Supply of Houston in a transaction valued at about $5 million. *********** Texaco Inc. plans to its expand coal gasification research and development unit at Montebello, Calif., at an estimated cost of more than $8 million. *********** Watsco purchased 21,000 shares of Florida Commercial Banks Inc., a Florida Bank holding company, for $530,000 cash and said that it had agreed to purchase an additional 91,300 shares for $25 a share. *********** United Technologies Corporation said its Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Group was awarded a $17.6 million NASA contract to provide the agency with eight rocket controlled engines for Centaur rocket stages."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/05/business/computer-technology-pervades-lif-e-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1981-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1577, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY PERVADES LIF E IN JAPAN", "print_headline": "COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY PERVADES LIF E IN JAPAN", "body_text": " **********At every turn here, one confronts overwhelming evidence that Japan, more than any other nation, has embraced advanced electronic and computer technology as a way to improve industrial productivity, save energy and, in theory, make day-to-day life more convenient, enriching and entertaining. **********The influence of such technology is apparent in hundreds of small ways. In the Asahi Shimbun building, home of the leading Japanese newspaper, venetian blinds rise and fall at the whim of an energyconscious computer. In the Hotel Okura, a visitor does not have to request a wake-up call because a soft beep can be ordered for any time by punching a few buttons on an electronic bedside console. **********''I've lived here for four years, so I should be inured to it, but I'm still struck every time I walk through Akihabara,'' said Eric W.  Hayden, chief economist for the Bank of America's Asia division. He was referring to the bustling district of semiconductor shops that form a veritable electronics flea market. ''This is where these people really excel - in electronics,'' he added. **********To expand its success in electronics, Japan hopes to do what it has not yet done: come up with new basic technology on its own, rather than just embellish the computer technology developed by other nations, the United States in particular. **********The market-oriented Japanese approach to electronic research has led Japan's trading partners to accuse it of being a free rider in the technological area. Japan now seems committed to changing this image. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry announced in recent months that it would spend more than $300 million over the next decade on these major research projects: **********- Development of a supercomputer that would be more than 60 times faster than the best now available. **********- Basic work on a ''fifth-generation'' computer that could follow oral commands as well as solve problems nobody told it to tackle - a capacity known as ''artificial intelligence.'' **********- Development of new, sophisticated semiconductor devices.  The prospect of Japan's forging ahead in computer manufacturing, a sector where the United States still claims supremacy, is worrying American executives and Government officials. They see the possibility of a challenge to the industry's giant, the International Business Machines Corporation. **********''There is a feeling that, in 10 years or so, the best computers in the world may well be made by Fujitsu and Hitachi,'' Franklin J.  Vargo, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce, said during a recent interview in his Washington office. ''If that happens, it will give Japan enormous leverage in the United States in terms of foreign and defense policy because we, as a society, are so dependent on computers, and that dependency will only increase.'' **********Japan's reliance on electronics and computers is easy to see in its factories, where impressive gains in productivity have been achieved, mainly because of the nation's ability to introduce electronic techniques in industries that were once mechanical. This has reduced labor costs and has increased efficiency. 'Robots Making Robots' **********Perhaps the most striking example of this trend is the handful of so-called manless factories that are springing up in Japan. In Nagoya, for instance, the Yamazaki Machinery Works has opened a plant in which computer-controlled machine tools produce more machine tools exactly like themselves. Some people describe the process as ''robots making robots.'' **********The plant, which will begin full operation in October, already runs 24 hours a day, with five workers in each of the first two shifts and no workers in the third shift. The main task of the human laborers is to check for wear on the 18 machines. Company officials told a delegation of Americans -members of Congress, business executives and academic leaders - who visited the plant last week that a conventional factory would need 70 machines and a work force of 200 to match the production of this automated setup. **********The evidence of observation and the success of Japanese electronic products in international markets suggest that Japan is a leader in making the transition toward an electronic-based, fully computerized society - what some people call the ''second industrial revolution.'' Jean-Jacque s Servan-Schreiber, the French writer, asserts in his new book, ''T he World Challenge,'' that ''Japan stands as a model to the world.'' **********An ambitious vision of Japan's future is offered in a report issued in June by an advisory group to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. This stud y, which has not yet b een published in English, predicts that the pace of computeriz ation will continue without letup, changing industrial practices and people's everyday routines more than ever. The report represent s a consensus of views of top business and governmental officials. Felt Virtually Everywhere **********A hint of things to come can also be seen on the office wall of the trade ministry's electronics policy division. Smiling cartoon characters in a black-and-white mural inhabit a community where the computer's presence is felt virtually everywhere - in homes, offices and other places. **********In the mural, physicians in hospitals have only to push a button to flash a patient's entire medical history onto a video screen.  Computer-controlled vehicles have replaced buses and taxis. Seagoing robots roam the ocean, gauging underwater currents and spotting schools of fish. **********Gesturing toward the mural, Kiyoshi Hosomizo, a department chief in the electronics policy division, says that ''these are examples of the future computer-oriented society.'' **********Although such a future is years away, the plan has moved beyond the drawing board. For example, 160 families near Osaka are already linked together by a network of computer terminals, cameras and microphones in a Government-sponsored experiment. The system allows two-way communication and includes a wide variety of entertainment and educational offerings, such as English lessons for individuals. **********''The experiment is going very well,'' said Haruo Katsuyama, the trade ministry official overseeing the project. ''The people like it because of all the information they can get.'' **********According to a booklet describing the experiment, the data in greatest demand are these: men want golfing lessons, women want cooking tips and children want cartoon fairy tales. Poor in Natural Resources **********Japan has moved so rapidly to increase the use of electronics and computers in its economy because it is poor in natural resources. The country has to import nearly all of the oil it consumes, for example. Reacting to the two oil price shocks of the 1970's, Japan began to develop an industrial system that relies on its highly skilled, energetic work force rather than on scarce resources. **********Beyond the pressure of necessity, however, Japan's impressive push into the electronic age also owes much to the business-oriented society that prevails in this nation of 118 million people.  Structural differences in the Japanese system, many observers say, has given it a big edge over other countries. **********In Japan, for example, much of the stock of big corporations is typically owned by banks and other financial institutions, far more so than in the United States. The banks are often major lenders to the same corporations whose stock they own. **********Being beholden to knowledgable owners and creditors, who are less concerned about quarterly profit gains than long-range financial health, makes it easier for Japanese corporate executives to invest in computer-controlled production equipment even if short-term earnings suffer as a result. **********In addition, antitrust laws in Japan are less stringent than in the United States, permitting a measure of consultation between companies and cooperative effort in some areas that would be illegal in America. Lifetime Employment **********Most large Japanese companies maintain a system of lifetime employment for their workers, and unions are delineated not by the workers' trade but by the company that employs them. All this helps explain why Japanese workers have been so receptive to the introduction of computers - they have no fear of losing their jobs. A machinist whose job has become obsolete, for instance, may become a specialist in programming the very robot that displaced him on the shop floor. **********Consequently, there are more robots in Japanese factories than in all other countries combined, it is generally believed. The Japan Industrial Robot Association says about 70,000 robots are operating in Japan. Other estimates vary because there is no clear-cut definition of just what qualifies as a robot. Narrower definitions put the Japanese robot population at roughly 7,500. **********The apparent ease with which Japan has moved toward a more efficient economy based on electronics is in marked contrast to the slowe r progre ss of other nations, including the United States. To some analysts , the Japanese success implies flaws in America's business and economic policies. **********''We have an antiquated financial system, antiquated antitrust laws, an antiquated labor system and an antiquated management approach,'' Prof. William G. Ouchi of the University of California at Los Angeles said the other day during an inte rview in Tokyo. He recently began a three-year study, financed b y several American companies, comparing the electronics industri es of Japan and the United States. **********''You don't find out your weaknesses until you have a competitor,'' Mr. Ouchi added. ''And Japan is that competitor.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/04/business/us-looks-into-charges-soviet-broke-arms-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Looks Into Charges Soviet Broke Arms Pact", "print_headline": "U.S. Looks Into Charges Soviet Broke Arms Pact", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration is examining alleged Soviet violations of the 1972 strategic arms treaty as part of a review of arms control policy toward Moscow, the State Department said today. **********William Dyess, the acting spokesman, said the Administration did not plan to call a special session of the Standing Consultative Commission to take up the issue. **********Aviation Week & Space Technology reported this week that Mr. Reagan was considering asking Moscow for a special February session of the commission to raise the issue of ''at least 30 challengeable Soviet SALT and other arms control violations.'' **********The commission, created under the 1972 treaty limiting antiballistic missile defenses, is supposed to meet at least twice a year to discuss compliance with the agreement. **********''We are reviewing our policy toward SALT and arms control matters in general,'' Mr. Dyess said.

An officer said that the casualties on both sides had been ''very light.'' Villagers in Honduras said that the area had been bombed for several days before the soldiers arrived.

But on the Honduran side of the border, a shirtless village boy, encouraged by his parents, led a reporter along a narrow, rutted path to a cornfield down the mountain from the Honduran village of Valladolid, near where the Salvadoran soldiers said they had landed.  The young villager told how he had watched as the helicopters hovered just above the cornstalks and the soldiers jumped out. He pointed in the directions they ran. Other villagers who said they were Hondurans also reported the landing. **********One Honduran army sergeant in the area said that the Salvadorans landed with permission from his Government.

Its business-cycle chronology dates back to 1854, and since 1961 its business-cycle evaluations have been adopted as official by the Department of Commerce. **********''The depth and breadth of the contraction in early 1980 clearly marked it as a recession in spite of its unusual brevity,'' the bureau said yesterday. Some economists had been reluctant to call the downturn a recession because a recession is normallly defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in the measure of total goods and services produced, known as the gross national product. In 1980, real G.N.P., the statistic that adjusts those overall output figures to eliminate the impact of inflation, declined only in the second quarter. **********The committee fixed last July as the trough of the decline at a meeting in Cambridge, Mass., yesterday at which it reviewed trends in key economic statistics. Some of these indicators, such as the G.N.P., retail sales and total civilian employment, reached their nadir in May or June. But most, including total industrial production, nonfarm employment, personal income and overall unemployment, did not indicate an end to the recession until July. Not 'Mechanical' **********On a quarterly basis, the economy reached a peak in the first quarter of 1980 and hit its trough in the third quarter, the committee said. **********''It is not a mechanical formula,'' said Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor who is president of the National Bureau and a member of the committee. ''We try to decide what is important and what may be explained by an anomaly.'' **********The decision that the trough came in July reflected not only broad statistics, but also figures showing that most industrial groups reached their production trough that month, he said. **********The decision came 13 months after the committee announced that the nation was in a recession that had begun in January 1980. The sevenmonth peak-to-trough movement was one month shorter than the previous record, set by the recession that lasted from August 1918 to March 1919. **********''There is really no trend to be seen from this,'' Mr. Feldstein said. The business-cycle information is primarily of interest to those who want to follow the performance of particular activities or markets, such as housing starts or interest rates, against the background of the business cycles. **********The recession was the nation's seventh since World War II. While it was shorter than the average of just under one year, it was marked by a 9.6 percent G.N.P. decline in the second quarter, the steepest on record. **********The economists who closed the books on the recession at yesterday's meeting were: Mr. Feldstein and Benjamin Freidman, both from Harvard University; Robert Gordon, Northwestern University; Robert Hall, Stanford University; Geoffrey Moore, director of the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Rutgers University, and Victor Zarnowitz, University of Chicago.

This afternoon, after a meeting of her Cabinet, President Sanjiva Reddy signed the proclamation that effectively turned over the administration of Kerala to the ministries of the federal Government. **********Mechanism Used Previously **********Soon after her return to power, Mrs. Gandhi used the same mechanism to turn out state governments in seven states that had been led by loyalists of the Janata coalition that she defeated and destroyed in national parliamentary elections in January 1980. Subsequently elections were ordered in these states and in each case Mrs. Gandhi's supporters won clear majorities. **********However, in the three states where Marxist governments held sway - Kerala, West Bengal and the small state of Tripura - Mrs. Gandhi's party has until now shied away from direct confrontation, even though the Prime Minister has often shown contempt for the factionalized Communists. Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, who is taking on increasing organizational responsibilities for her party, has spoken of the need to impede efforts at unity by the divided Communists and has described at least one of the factions as representing a potentially competitive party with effective grass-roots mobilization. **********There has been no firm evidence to suggest that the defections from the Marxist coalition were engineered by Mrs. Gandhi's followers, who are relatively weak in Kerala, a state that has often been called the political laboratory of India. **********On the other hand, it is clear that Mrs. Gandhi's close advisers moved quickly to take advantage of the political void that developed. In the past her party has used the period of President's rule to build up effective election machines, or entice opposition politicians to defect. Complex Three-Way Relations **********While these maneuverings have great importance for the future of Kerala, a tropical area on the Arabian Sea, the major significance involves the complex relations between Mrs. Gandhi, the Indian Communist parties and Moscow. **********Basically, Mrs. Gandhi has great contempt for the more orthodox and pro-Soviet of the two major Communist parties. This group, the Communist Party of India, had publicly recanted for having been the single opposition group to have supported Mrs. Gandhi's suspension of democratic rule in 1975. Her scorn for the other, larger Communist party, the Communist Party of India-Marxist, which governs in West Bengal and Tripura, is only slightly less apparent. Still, these parties support her Government's foreign policies, and all three have claims on the Soviet Union. **********From time to time, aides close to Mrs. Gandhi tell Western diplomats she is annoyed that Moscow appears to be encouraging unity among the two Communist groups. One Western diplomat says that while Mrs. Gandhi may well be bothered by professions of international solidarity she must be aware that Soviet obligations to her Government far outweigh Soviet duties to the Communist parties. The diplomat suggested that one motive for the leaked reports of her annoyance is a strong desire by Mrs. Gandhi to assert nonalignment. **********It was this interest, for example, that led Mrs. Gandhi to give short shrift to the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the Indian-Soviet friendship treaty. While the occasion was marked in Moscow by special editions of Pravda and long statements by Leonid I. Brezhnev and all major Politburo members, here there was only an eight-paragraph comment from Mrs. Gandhi. The Prime Minister also spurned Soviet invitations to go to Moscow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/14/business/commodity-option-entices-exchanges.html": {"writer_name": "Karen Arenson", "pub_date": "1981-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMMODITY OPTION ENTICES EXCHANGES", "print_headline": "COMMODITY OPTION ENTICES EXCHANGES", "body_text": " **********Just as stock options and financial futures developed into the hot investments of the 1970's, the nation's financial exchanges hope to make a new product, commodity options, the trading star of the 1980's. **********Some exchanges have applied to Federal regulators for permission to trade these options. Others are either developing proposals or studying the possibility. Gold and silver, coffee and sugar, Treasury securities and other financial instruments - the exchanges are interested in all of them. **********''The people we've worked with feel the potential is huge, that options on financial instruments could eventually dwarf options on stocks,'' said Thomas N. Rzepski, senior vice president at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. **********An option simply gives its buyer the right to purchase some amount of an item at a fixed price within a certain period, even if the price of the item itself increases. The commodity options proposals being developed involve options on commodity futures contracts as well as options on physical commodities. A futures contract commits an investor to purchase or sell a fixed amount of a commodity at a set price within a certain period. But the investor may be forced to pay more money to meet margin calls if the price of the commodity contract fluctuates sharply. Options eliminate that risk. **********Futures and options are somewhat exotic types of financial instruments used by major corporations and wealthy individuals, but are not recommended to smaller investors. **********Like futures contracts, options can be used by businesses to insure a constant price for the goods they plan to use in the future, and are favored by speculators for their substantial leverage. But the cost for an option is a single relatively small fee, known as the premium, paid at the front end, rather than the unforseeable margin calls on futures contracts. **********Stock options have boomed in the seven years they have been traded on exchanges, with 96.7 million contracts traded last year. But efforts to create exchange-traded commodity options stalled in 1979 when members of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission failed to agree on rules for trading. There had been efforts to put commodity options on exchanges after scandals in over-the-counter commodity options led the commission to ban their sales by all but a few dealers. **********Now investment industry executives have new hope that commodity options are about to take off. For one thing, the complexion of the commission is expected to change when the Reagan administration fills three slots on the five-member commission, two open now and one opening in April. Industry participants say that could break the logjam at the commission that has blocked approval of options trading. **********In the meantime, however, the Securities and Exchange Commission has asserted its own jurisdiction over what it calls options on financial instruments. The S.E.C. seems to be moving actively toward approving one proposal, by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, to trade options on mortgage securities guaranteed by the Government (Government National Mortgage Association certificates, known as Ginnie Maes). The commission is also moving, though more slowly, on the exchange's second proposal, for options on Treasury bills. **********Among the staunchest advocates of the proposal is the mortgage banking industry, whose spokesmen say options may provide more funds for the housing market. **********A Federal Reserve study on exchange-traded options agreed, noting that the instruments would probably ''to a degree facilitate the process of forming and investing in home mortgage pools.'' **********''Everyone seems to be in general agreement that a product like the Ginnie Mae options is desirable,'' said Douglas Scarff, director of the S.E.C.'s Division of Market Regulation. Jurisdictional Questions **********The apparent readiness of the S.E.C. to approve a new kind of option - stock options are already traded on several exchanges - raises ticklish jurisdictional questions. Some maintain that the Congressional charter of the futures commission specifically gives it responsibility for all options other than stock options. Others say that all options on securities should come under the S.E.C., and that only options on more traditional commodities belong to the commodity agency. But whatever the arguments, they have not stopped the rush by exchanges to develop their own options proposals: **********- The Chicago Board of Trade plans to apply to the futures commission to trade options on futures contracts in Treasury bonds and Ginnie Mae's. In December, the board voted to create a separate division to trade options, with 150 new memberships to be sold at no more than $30,000 each. **********- The American Stock Exchange board voted last Thursday to apply to the S.E.C. for options on 13-week Treasury bills and 30-year Treasury bonds. **********- The New York Stock Exchange board voted last Wednesday to consider developing options on Ginnie Maes, Treasury securities, foreign currencies, gold, silver and a stock index. ''We have been delayed on stock options because some people think we have an unfair advantage because we trade stocks,'' John J. Phelan Jr., president of the exchange, said. **********- The New York Futures Exchange, a subsidiary of the Big Board, plans to apply for options on futures contracts, probably on Treasury bills and bonds. **********- The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which already trades stock options, is planning to apply to the S.E.C. for options on five foreign currencies. It is expected to file shortly. **********- The Commodity Exchange in New York is still hoping for clearance from the futures commission on silver and copper options, for which it applied in 1975, and on gold options, for which it filed in 1976. New York Board Studies Platinum **********The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange all said they were not working on options applications now but would if other applications began to be approved. **********Such a panoply of new options, if all approved, could be somewhat confusing to investors. Potentially more disconcerting, however, is the possible confusion over the difference between the options on commodity futures contracts and the options on the commodities themselves. Someday, for example, there could be an option on Ginnie Maes and a separate option on a futures contract on Ginnie Maes. **********Industry experts say that the direct commodity options might be conceptually easier to follow, but that there would be relatively little economic difference between the two. ''The biggest differences may be in the rules imposed by the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C.,'' one observer said. ''The broker may aim for the less regulated market, which may or may not help the investor depending on the nature of the rules.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/03/business/wieboldt-stores-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 28, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WIEBOLDT STORES INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 2", "print_headline": "WIEBOLDT STORES INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 2", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/27/business/steel-production-down.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Steel Production Down", "print_headline": "Steel Production Down", "body_text": " **********Steel production fell to 2.585 million tons in the week ended last Saturday, a decrease of 1.1 percent from the previous week's 2.613 million tons, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported yesterday. **********The industry's production amounted to 86.4 percent of capacity during the week, compared with 87.3 percent in the previous week.

It prescribes summary trial for anyone inciting or participating in an illegal strike, and imprisonment and fines for those found guilty.  The legislation is intended to replace an ordinance containing similar provisions that was signed by President Sanjiva Reddy on July 27. **********Although the unions have planned joint opposition within Parliament and big rallies outside, they concede that they cannot block the bill because Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's Congress Party has a decisive majority. Further, a major union, the Indian National Trade Union Congress, is affiliated with her party and is supporting the legislation. Move to 'Shatter' Unions Seen **********''The ban on strikes is intended to shatter the trade union movement in India,'' said P. Ramamurti, secretary of the Center of Indian Trade Unions, which is affiliated with the Marxist Communist Party of India. The party controls two state governments, those of West Bengal and Kerala, and both vehemently oppose the bill. **********Leaders of the central Government have justified the bill on the ground that opposition political parties were misusing the unions to obstruct production and distribution in an effort to undermine the Government. **********In the campaign against the bill, the All-India Trade Union Congress, which is affiliated with the pro-Moscow Communist Party, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a union affiliated with the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, and the Hind Mazdoor Sangh, a Socialist grouping, have joined hands along with several smaller union organizations. **********On the opening day of Parliament, Aug. 17, several thousand workers belonging to these unions held a rally outside to denounce the bill. Mr. Ramamurti said that a larger rally was being planned for November to mark the beginning of countrywide agitation against the ''black law.'' **********However, he acknowledged that he felt ''helpless'' in the face of the strong support Mrs. Gandhi has gained from her party and the lukewarm attitude of the general public. Many Workers Called Indifferent **********Subramania Swamy, a leader of the opposition Janata Party and president of the Life Insurance Corporation union, which has over 20,000 members, said that a large number of the workers themselves were indifferent to the call for agitation against the bill. **********''The trade union leaders have abused the strike weapon so often that most workers actually welcome the ban,'' he said.

Downey, a Democrat from a district of suburbs and small businesses on the south shore of Long Island, wants to find another way to cut taxes, perhaps by widening existing income brackets. **********Mr. Downey, Mr. Jenkins and three other Ways and Means Democrats will meet for the first time tomorrow as a task force appointed by the committee chairman, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, to advise the Democrats how best to shape this part of a tax-relief bill. Stresses Among Democrats **********The difference in approach between Mr. Jenkins, a conservative, and Mr. Downey, a liberal, is typical of the stresses that already have sundered House Democrats. Leaders of the conservative wing have pledged to support President Reagan's bill to cut personal tax rates by 25 percent over 33 months, starting with a 5 percent cut Oct.1.  There would also be cuts of 10 percent on July 1, 1982, and July 1, 1983. **********Mr. Rostenkowski and the Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., have drawn a line at a two-stage, 15-percent reduction in rates, plus a grab-bag of other provisions that already have been incorporated in large part into the Reagan bill. For the mainstream Democrats, the challenge is to write a bill that is different from the President's, responsible and politically palatable to most Democrats and perhaps a few Republicans. **********A showdown on the House floor is more than a month away. The Ways and Means Committee will begin drafting business tax-relief provisions on Tuesday. Mr. Rostenkowski has left individual tax relief for last because it is politically the most explosive part of the package. Democrats' Morale Is Low **********Morale among the Democrats is not high. A liberal, asked to appraise the chances of beating the President on the House floor, replied ''dismal.'' When Mr. Jenkins was asked if abandoning uniform, across-the-board rate cuts would make it harder to win, he replied, ''I think it's going to be hard to win anyway.'' **********Another Southern Democrat who is loyal to the leadership said the White House ''has locked it up'' by writing into its bill relief from the so-called windfall profits tax on crude oil and from the estate tax, the bane of farmers, ranchers and small-business owners. Those two lures won a number of Southern Democrats to the Administration's cause, the loyal Southerner said, particularly several Texans. **********Mr. Jenkins says Mr. Reagan is popular in his district but he also asserts that the many low-income workers there would like a Democratic-style tax bill. Administration Says Bill Is Fair **********The Administration contends that its bill is fair because it would allocate tax relief in proportion to current tax burdens. For example, under current law, persons in the $20,000-to-$30,000 annual income range would pay an estimated 20.7 percent of 1984 taxes, according to the Treasury, and would get 21.3 of the President's total tax cut. **********''We are asking how can we distribute this in a more equitable way,'' counters Representative James M. Shannon of Massachusetts, a liberal Democrat on Ways and Means. **********Mr. Shannon and others contend that a tilt to taxpayers below $50,000 would be just because they ''are people who have suffered the greatest increase in burden,'' but the Democrats also acknowledge that they have an eye on political consequences. **********''We Democrats want to make sure that our people, people who make moderate incomes, get the tax relief they need,'' Speaker O'Neill said on June 2. Reduction in Brackets **********In searching for a ''Democratic'' tax-cutting formula, the Democrats are looking at a variety of ideas. Representative Wyche Fowler Jr., a moderate from the suburbs of Atlanta, has asked the staff of the Joint Tax Committee to design tax tables with only five or seven brackets, compared to sixteen now. The lowest bracket would start at a higher tax rate than the 14 percent now in effect, but also would start at a higher level of income. **********Another idea is to offer more generous relief from the ''marriage penalty'' than the maximum $3,000 deduction proposed by the President; the Democrats are considering $4,000. With a $4,000 maximum deduction for couples, based on 10 percent of the lower-earning spouse's income, one Democratic formula being considered would give an average 1982 tax cut of $1,059 to taxpayers with total income of $30,000 to $50,000, compared to $789 in the Reagan measure. **********Put differently, the Democrats would give these taxpayers 32.2 percent of the total tax saving against 30 percent in the Administration bill. These calculations were done for the Democrats by the Joint Committee staff. Wanting to Be Different **********These are not profound differences.  The reasons for the items that the Democrats list add up to one thing - a felt need to be different. Right now, say the Democrats, the similarities between their position and Mr. Reagan's are greater than the differences, largely because each has adopted part of the other's position. The Democrats, for example, now favor dropping the current 70 percent maximum tax rate on investment income to 50 percent, a proposal the Reagan White House liked but avoided as politically risky for Republicans. **********The most readily grasped difference is that Mr. Reagan would mandate now a third cut in rates, in 1983.  Some Democrats say privately that the Republican Senate ultimately will force the Democratic House to accept a 1983 rate cut. Others, like Mr. Fowler of Georgia, speculate that the President will ultimately settle for two years on the grounds of fiscal conservatism."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/20/business/foundation-selling-assets-worth-over-1-billion.html": {"writer_name": "Kathleen Teltsch", "pub_date": "1981-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1007, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOUNDATION SELLING ASSETS WORTH OVER $1 BILLION", "print_headline": "FOUNDATION SELLING ASSETS WORTH OVER $1 BILLION", "body_text": " **********The MacArthur Foundation of Chicago, one of the country's wealthiest foundations, is selling its considerable assets in insurance companies and real estate. Its aim is to comply with Federal laws limiting the tax-free business ownership that is permitted private foundations. **********According to experts in the investment banking community, the sale may realize $1 billion to $2 billion for the MacArthur Foundation and would consolidate its position as a financial leader in the philanthropic field, possibly second only to the Ford Foundation, which lists its assets at $2.7 billion. **********''The divestiture, which is necessitated by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, will enable us to substantially increase our grant programs,'' Gaylord Freeman, chairman of the MacArthur Foundation's finance committee, said yesterday. The act limits a foundation's ownership of a business property to a 20 percent holding. **********The John D.  and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation is the sole owner of the Bankers Life and Casualty Company, which has more than 80 subsidiaries and properties. These properties include the Gulf and Western Building, the Lincoln Towers residential complex and 15 other office buildings in Manhattan, 85,000 acres of prime real estate in Florida and shopping centers or other commercial holdings in Dallas, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Chicago and other cities. **********The Foundation has acquired a reputation for innovative grantmaking that included rescuing Harper's magazine by paying $4.1 million for it when it was on the verge of closing because of its financial problems. The foundation also devoted $6.5 million to discover and support exceptionally talented scientists and artists by providing them with no-strings prizes ranging up to $60,000 a year. Keeping Headquarters Site **********Although the foundation would sell virtually all of its real estate, it would retain its headquarters, the Marquette Building in Chicago. **********''We believe this may be the largest transaction involving a privately owned company,'' said Larry Michel, a managing director of Warburg Paribas Becker Inc. He and Donald A. Petrie, a partner of Lazard Freres & Company, represent the two concerns handling the undertaking. **********They placed advertisements yesterday in newspapers in the United States and abroad, saying they were exclusive agents for the divestiture of Bankers Life. This company was described as one of the largest writers of accident, health and life insurance policies and sole owner of a large portfolio of commercial and residential properties. **********The agents are looking for a single purchaser, and there will be no public sale of the MacArthur holdings. They declined to discuss the undertaking, but offerings of this dimension are usually arranged to attract a relatively small number of potential buyers who already are known to the major banking houses. Only those capable of such a purchase receive a brochure giving details of the properties. **********Life insurance companies are in a regulated industry, adding an element of ethical standing to be satisfied.  The properties offered include the Colonnades Beach Hotel in West Palm Beach, Fla., where the late John D. MacArthur lived until he died three years ago at the age of 80. He occupied a modest threeroom apartment and conducted his business from a table in the hotel's coffee shop because he disliked opulent offices. Getting Started in Chicago **********Mr. MacArthur, a self-made multimillionaire, started his business career in Chicago by selling low-cost insurance policies, making enough money to buy the nearly bankrupt Bankers Life for $2,500 in 1935. Within five years he had built its assets to $1 million. In 1978 the company's assets were estimated at a little over $1 billion. **********Along the way, Mr. MacArthur acquired vast land holdings in Florida's Palm Beach area that included three golf courses, one of them the former P.G.A. National Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens that he designed. He also acquired prime office buildings in New York including the 44-story Gulf and Western tower at Columbus Circle, opened in 1970, and the Lincoln Tower residential property with 3,850 apartment units as well as an office building at 410 Park Avenue and other commercial properties. He also bought but disposed of myriad other holdings that included banks and utilities, paper and pulp plants, a tug and barge fleet, an oil-drilling company and a distillery. Foundation Specified in Will **********When Mr. MacArthur died in 1978, he left the bulk of his estate for establishment of the foundation, leaving its program to be shaped by his widow and son, J. Roderick MacArthur, and a few business associates. They, in turn, expanded its board, bringing in a number of prominent scientists. John E. Corbally, a former president of the University of Illinois, became its president. **********The MacArthur Foundation listed its assets at $840 million in 1979. This put it in third place behind the Ford Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (which had assets just above $1 billion at the end of last year). Directors of the MacArthur Foundation said privately, however, that the full extent of its holdings had not been fixed and that the assets would exceed $1 billion. How the 1969 Law Evolved **********Its sale of properties is the largest divestiture since the 1969 Tax Reform Act was passed, according to John A. Edie, a lawyer for the Council on Foundations in Washington, which represents 950 foundations of all sizes. **********The regulations regarding the business holdings of private foundations evolved after Congressional committees examined the practices of the country's foundations. The committees turned up some instances of financial misconduct, providing fuel for critics demanding tighter control. Some people argued that limiting ownership would help curb conflict-of-interest abuses. It was decided that it would be prudent to make foundations diversify their holdings to assure their grant-making ability. **********The new rules limited ownership to 20 percent of a business enterprise and gave foundations five years to dispose of the excess.  The MacArthur Foundation, because it was established in 1978, has until Dec. 1, 1983, to dispose of its properties or face penalties."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/28/business/replacement-sought-for-jeep.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Replacement Sought for Jeep", "print_headline": "Replacement Sought for Jeep", "body_text": " **********The Army said today that it had asked 61 companies, including the major auto makers and suppliers, to suggest a replacement for its most-famous vehicle, the jeep. **********Michael J.

Motown at Top of List **********Motown Industries, an entertainment company, retained its No.1 spot with $91.7 million in revenues. In addition to Wallace & Wallace, the four other energy-related concerns in the top 10 were the Vanguard Oil and Service Company, with revenues of $50.5 million; Smith Pipe and Supply Inc., with revenues of $48 million; the Grimes Oil Company, with revenues of $40 million, and the Chioke International Corporation, with revenues of $35 million. **********Despite the glut of petroleum products that has slowed the sales of the major oil companies, Richard Carroll, operations manager for Grimes Oil, said he expected Grimes's sales to increase in the next year. The heating oil distributor services a large black population, Mr. Carroll said, but its source of revenue is widely distributed among the general population and includes major commercial contracts. **********The sales of the 13 manufacturing companies, which make up the second-largest group on the list, rose 31.6 percent, to $209 million in aggregate sales. M & M Products of Atlanta, a producer of hair care products for the black consumer, led the manufacturing list in terms of growth with a 184 percent jump, to $27 million. Listing of Banks **********Included in the June issue of Black Enterprise was an overview of banks, savings and loan associations, and insurance companies that are owned and controlled by blacks.

The assets of black-owned commercial banks edged up by 6.6 percent, to $1.26 billion. **********Mr. Graves said the top 100 companies and the black-owned financial institutions employed an estimated 25,000 blacks, or about three-tenths of 1 percent of the total number of working blacks. **********Companies on the list were based in 20 states and the District of Columbia, with 15 in New York, 11 in Illinois, 11 in California, 10 in Michigan, six in Ohio, five in Georgia and five in Maryland."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/09/business/casino-transfer-in-atlantic-city-set.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Casino Transfer In Atlantic City Set", "print_headline": "Casino Transfer In Atlantic City Set", "body_text": " **********In the first transfer of ownership of an Atlantic City casino-hotel, Dallas-based Inns of the Americas Inc. has taken over the controlling interest in the struggling Brighton Hotel and Casino under a previously announced agreement. **********The company and two businessmen from Binghamton, N.Y., paid about $30 million for a 78 percent interest in the Greate Bay Hotel Corporation, which in turn owns 73 percent interest in the casinohotel and a country club and condominium development in nearby Somers Point. **********The 504-room Brighton, which was built for about $70 million, opened last August as the fourth of seven legal casinos here.

Mr. Specter invited Mr.  Baxter to criticize the Reagan Administration's decontrol of oil prices last month on the ground that oil companies had more money coming in than they could reinvest in oil exploration. Mr. Baxter demurred. **********Mr. Baxter said oil companies could not be criticized for failing to reinvest all of their revenues in exploration because makers of drilling rigs and oilfield equipment cannot keep up with orders. On that ground, Mr. Specter asked whether Congress should postpone deregulation of natural gas. **********Mr. Baxter said he was reluctant to discuss policy outside the antitrust sphere, then did so: ''Free market prices are probably the most important conservation devices we can find.'' **********As for acquisitions, the company's belief that it would increase profits ''is sufficient reason for me to leave it alone'' if there is no evidence of anticompetitive results in a single product market, he said. He added, however, that understanding the buying company's motives entered into determining the effect on competition. **********Mr. Baxter said that he saw nothing wrong with long-term agreements between sellers and customers if they promoted efficiency and did not diminish competition. This is a much-disputed, complex area of antitrust law. **********Mr. Baxter said that had he been sitting on the Supreme Court in 1977, he would have held with the majority in the Illinois Brick case that the right to sue suspected price fixers for treble damages should be confined to direct purchasers. **********As for abolishing the antitrust function of the Federal Trade Commission, Mr. Baxter said that was for Congress to decide but he knew of no ''sound reason'' for having two agencies with antitrust responsibility.

''A recession,'' concluded the report, which surveyed purchasing agents at 225 major industrial concerns, ''is definitely upon us.'' **********The survey is regarded as an indication of future economic trends, since today's purchasing orders are a factor in determining the strength of tomorrow's economy. **********In Close Touch With Data **********The purchasing agents must be in close touch with their companies' production and sales figures before they can place orders for supplies. The association has been conducting the monthly survey of its members since the 1930's. **********Judging from the tapestry of gloom woven by purchasing agents questioned in the November poll, the recession will be more than just a mild downturn. **********The report said that ''there are some striking similarities between this period and the dismal performance of the economy in the second quarter of 1980, when real gross national product dropped by almost 10 percent.'' Purchasing agents, it added, found that all key economic indicators - new orders, capital expenditures, production and employment - continued to decline substantially in November. 'Orders Fell Off a Cliff' **********''The chemicals and container salesmen to whom I talk say that their orders fell off a cliff in November and are not showing any improvement in December,'' said Hank Batek, regional purchasing manager for the Nalco Chemical Company, a major producer of specialty chemical products based in Oak Brook, Ill. ''It has not bottomed out yet, not by a long shot.'' **********''Business has dropped like a stone in the last month,'' said Douglas D. Rossman, raw materials purchaser for the Federal-Mogul Corporation, a Southfield, Mich., manufacturer of bearings and other metal products. Its business is highly influenced by the fortunes of the automobile and construction industries. **********''We are cutting back our orders from the steel mills and brokers of nonferrous metals such as copper, tin and aluminum,'' added Mr.  Rossman, whose views were not included in the purchasing managers' survey. The only bright spot, he said, was that requests by suppliers for price increases in 1982 were much less than in the previous two years since no one could take their customers for granted any more. **********Only 25 percent of the purchasing managers in the association's survey said that the prices of the goods they were buying were up in November. That has happened just once before since the 1973-75 recession. Of those who did cite increased costs, many said that the official prices were being offset by considerable discounting. Prices of Rail Products Down **********William C. Meares, assistant vice president for purchasing at the Santa Fe Railroad, said he has not only seen price stabilization in railroad products, but some significant price deterioration. ''It's a buyer's market,'' added Mr. Meares, ''and we are tickled to death.'' **********The association's survey found that its members increased the rate at which they were cutting their inventories in November, an indication that companies were reaching into their warehouses instead of placing new orders. Any inventory accumulation that is taking place is largely a result of companies not being able to move the new products coming off the assembly line. **********''Everyone is very cautious,'' said Ralph P. Baker, vice president for purchasing at the Corning Glass Works. ''They want to see what kind of incoming orders they get for next year before they commit themselves to building up inventories. Right now orders are soft and if they stay that way we are going to hold down on our output so we don't build up excessive stocks.'' **********Donald O. Corvey, vice president for materials at the RCA Corporation, said orders for consumer products such as television sets and other electronic entertainment equipment had been ''sluggish.'' Although the fourth quarter is usually the biggest quarter of the year for RCA's consumer goods, this year's sales were trailing last year's, he added. Interest in Leasing Cited **********The global communications and satellite business has fared better, he said, but there was still a noticeable ''restraint'' in capital expenditures. Customers are much more interested in leasing equipment unless it is absolutely essential that they buy, he explained. **********That assessment was echoed in the association's survey. The number of purchasing managers saying that they were committing themselves to capital equipment orders ''six months in advance or longer'' fell to 64 percent -the lowest level since March 1973, just before the last major recession. Industry is trying to survive by ordering ''hand-to-mouth,'' the report said. **********Probably the most pessimistic aspect of the purchasing managers' report was the outlook on employment. In November, only 3 percent of the respondents said their employment was higher, down from 7 percent in October. This was the smallest number of managers to report higher employment since the end of World War II. **********''We have a hiring freeze on in our department,'' said Gary E.  Owens, purchasing agent for the Travelers Insurance Company in Hartford, ''and the same is true throughout most of the company. We are replacing people who leave, but there are no additions to the staff. We are definitely in a recession and we don't know when this thing is going to bottom out.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/07/business/installment-debt-rose-in-january.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 399, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INSTALLMENT DEBT ROSE IN JANUARY", "print_headline": "INSTALLMENT DEBT ROSE IN JANUARY", "body_text": " **********The nation's consumers increased their installment debt for the sixth consecutive month in January, buying $869 million more on credit than they paid off, the Federal Reserve Board reported today. **********The expansion in short-term debt was about half the $1.6 billion increase recorded in December, in line with many analysts' predictions that credit growth would slow early this year along with a slackening of the nation's economic growth. **********''The rate of expansion weakened for all categories of installment credit, with small declines registered for automobile and mobile home loans,'' the report said.

The retroactive application of a $2-a-barrel crude oil price increase by Saudi Arabia also hurt. **********Exxon's flat quarter came despite foreign exchange gains of $215 million, up sharply from the $2 million posted a year earlier.  For the full year, Mr. Garvin said, ''Earnings in the exploration and production segment of the United States petroleum and natural gas operations rose to $2.13 billion from $1.44 billion in 1979,'' mainly because of higher prices. **********The Exxon chairman also cited year-to-year annual gains in the refining and marketing segments of United States petroleum operations, and for foreign exploration, production, refining and marketing. Worldwide chemical earnings fell to $404 million in 1980 from $456 million in 1979. Marathon **********The Marathon Oil Company announced fourth-quarter earnings of $55.3 million, or 92 cents a share, up from the $54.3 million, or 90 cents a share, in the comparable 1979 period. Revenues increased 9 percent, to $2.42 billion from $2.22 billion. **********For the full year, Marathon reported earnings of $379 million, or $6.27 a share, compared with $323.2 million, or $5.34 a share, in 1979. The 1979 result included an extraordinary credit of $28 million, or 46 cents a share, realized in the first half. Revenues increased to $8.75 billion from $7.2 billion. **********Marathon said its income from United States exploration and production activities showed strong improvement in the quarter, and that this increase offset the worldwide impact of lower demand for refined products and higher exploration costs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/08/world/polish-union-to-open-publicity-office-in-new-york.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1981-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 466, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POLISH UNION TO OPEN PUBLICITY OFFICE IN NEW YORK", "print_headline": "POLISH UNION TO OPEN PUBLICITY OFFICE IN NEW YORK", "body_text": " **********A representative of Solidarity, Poland's in dependent trade union movement, marched in the Labor Day parade in New York yesterday and said that in two weeks he would open in New York the first foreign office of Solidarity. **********Zygmunt Przetakiewicz, 35 years old, said that he would be the managing director of a press and information office that would supply news of the union movement to American news organizations. **********Mr. Przetakiewicz, who speaks good English, arrived in New York two weeks ago and has taken office space at 260 Park Avenue South, the building occupied by the United Federation of Teachers. **********''We will be opening officially at the end of September,'' Mr.  Przetakiewicz said.

But Sir Norman's family, incensed at what they see as the inadequacy of the security along the border, had told him that he was not welcome. **********The Stronge family's symbolic protest against the British Government reflects a growing sense of insecurity and fear among Protestants on this side of the 300-mile border, which is frequently crossed and recrossed by Irish Republican gunmen, who feel safest in the south. **********''You learn to live with the fear because it is part of your daily life,'' said a Protestant woman who was buying eggs and butter in the Tynan grocery store, just down the road from the 18th-century mansion in which Irish Republican Army gunmen killed Sir Norman, a former Speaker of the provincial legislature, and his son, James, last Wednesday night. 'Ruling Classes' Warned **********After the attack, in which the Stronge house was burned by firebombs, the Provisional I.R.A. issued a statement warning other members of what it called the ''Loyalist ruling classes'' that they were also in ''the firing line.'' **********The statement acknowledged that this was a ''departure'' for the terrorist organization, which had been concentrating its attacks on policemen, soldiers and others actively in the service of the Government, and it sent through the province shivers of anxiety that there might be a new wave of killings. **********''If the Government shows that it cannot protect law-abiding citizens, then there will be more and more of these murders,'' said Harold McCusker, who represents this area in the Parliament in London and who has had dozens of constituents killed in recent years. **********The murder of Sir Norman and his son was thought to have been retribution for an attack five days earlier on Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, the activist who gained international renown as a young member of Parliament in the early 1970's. Mrs. McAliskey and her husband, Michael, were shot in their home 15 miles north of here, presumably by members of a Protestant paramilitary group. Both were badly wounded and are still hospitalized in Belfast. Numerous Roads Cross Border **********The ease with which Sir Norman Stronge's killers escaped, despite a huge and immediate manhunt across the hills and meadows of his 900-acre estate and beyond, reflects a perennial problem that concerns the Governments in both Belfast and Dublin - the porousness of the long border. **********The border cuts across farms, villages and even pubs, and it is crossed by as many as 300 roads and lanes and paths that are wide enough to accommodate a carload of terrorists sneaking north or rushing back south. **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Government have lately been praising the police in the Irish Republic for being more and more cooperative in the cross-border fight against terrorism. ''We have no complaints at all on that score,'' said an official involved with the problem in London. **********But in the view of the people here, including Mr. McCusker, that sort of talk is largely designed to placate the Dublin Government, with which London is eagerly striving to have better relations. **********''I'm not saying that no progress has been made with the police in the Republic, but we must do more on our side,'' said Mr. McCusker, who said he ''fully sympathized'' with the Stronge family's desire not to have the British Government represented at the funeral. Protestant Families Nervous **********In most of Northern Ireland, Protestants are heavily in the majority, and in fact the province was created 60 years ago along lines drawn to make it so. But here along the border there are many areas where Roman Catholics predominate, and the surrounded Protestant families are often nervous. **********''Please don't mention my name,'' said a Protestant woman who lives in a small town southeast of here. ''We feel that we are targets enough as it is.'' **********I.R.A. sources in Belfast have traditionally said that Protestants who live in this area are safe from attack so long as they are not affiliated with the police, the militia or the Government. But last week's statement threatening the ''Loyalist ruling classes'' seemed to narrow that immunity. I.R.A. 'Cannot Drive Us Out' **********''They cannot drive us out, though,'' said a Protestant farmer whose brother, a part-time policeman, was shot dead two years ago.  ''It's our home, too, and we are staying.'' **********Many of the 11,200 British troops stationed in Northern Ireland are constantly along the border, especially in the stretch of it here where County Monaghan, in the Republic, meets County Armagh, in the North. It is startling to come suddenly across them on patrol - half a dozen young men in battle fatigues, who seem out of place as they stalk watchfully through what looks like peaceful green countryside, their automatic weapons at the ready. **********''We stop everyone who comes along here,'' said the sergeant commanding a patrol on a narrow and muddy back road half a mile from Sir Norman Stronge's house. ''And we watch everything that moves. But still, we could not prevent them from murdering that old man.

Republicans charge that the Democrats are trying to hang onto Federal revenues in an effort to reverse this year's budget cuts in the future. **********Mr. Reagan has backed away from his original proposal of three consecutive annual tax cuts of 10 percent to the extent that he has accepted the proposal of the Southern Democrats for a 5 percent cut in the first year, starting Oct. 1, and 10 percent in 1982 and again in 1983. No Further Action Planned **********Mr. Stenholm said his group would take no further action on taxes until the shape of a Ways and Means bill was clear. **********Representative Hance, a conservative Democrat, reported that there was informal agreement on the Ways and Means Committee on a 5 percent cut in tax rates, effective Oct. 1, and a 10 percent cut on July 1, 1982. He said that the committee Democrats were also in general agreement that extra tax relief for people with incomes of $20,000 to $50,000 - a tilt that Mr. Rostenkowski has insisted upon - would be delivered by a provision to soften the ''marriage penalty'' paid by some two-income couples, an increase in the standard deduction for taxpayers who do not itemize, and liberalization of tax deductions for retirement savings. **********That framework is similar to a bill drafted by Mr. Hance and adopted by the Conservative Democratic Forum, except that Mr. Hance's bill has an additional 10 percent cut in 1983. The Reagan Administration has indicated that it would go along with such a three-year bill. Committee Compromise Seen **********Some Democrats suggested that the bill-drafting process in the committee might produce a bipartisan compromise that a number of House Republicans, if not the President, would support. **********''I think we'll work out in committee what will be called a compromise,'' said Representative Wyche Fowler Jr., a Georgia Democrat on the committee. Aides to Representative Rostenkowski also hinted at the possibility of Republican support. **********Emerging early this evening from a two-hour meeting with committee Democrats, Mr. Rostenkowski, a Chicago Democrat, said ''progress was made with respect to where we should be going'' and that another such session would start at 2 P.M. tomorrow. Asked if the committee would go into a formal bill-drafting session next week, as has been anticipated, he replied, ''Ask me at 2 P.M. tomorrow,'' He apparently meant after the meeting tomorrow. **********''I hope we can fashion a program that can be enjoyed by all Democrats on the floor of the House,'' Mr. Rostenkowski said. In reply to a question, he added that ''we're talking of the possibility of a multiyear bill.'' Later, he acknowledged that he meant a two-year bill. **********In light of the failure of the Democratic leadership and President Reagan to come to terms on taxes at the White House meeting yesterday, the next move was thought to be Mr. Rostenkowski's. O'Neill Accused by Dole **********''The next move must be theirs,'' said Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, after a meeting of Congressional Republican leaders with Mr. Reagan. Mr. Dole accused the Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts, of being ''so out of touch that he doesn't want the American people to have tax cuts.'' **********Mr. O'Neill in turn called the Administration's three-year tax relief proposal ''a lemon from the beginning.'' He said that ''we Democrats want to make sure that our people, people who make moderate incomes, get the tax relief they need.'' **********An aide to the Speaker, clarifying a report of yesterday's White House meeting, said Mr. O'Neill told the President that ''he hoped'' Congress would pass a tax bill by Aug. 1 and that ''the House would do its part.'' A Republican at the meeting had reported that Mr.  O'Neill assured Mr. Reagan of passage by Aug. 1. **********One of the conservative Democrats who met with Mr. Rostenkowski for breakfast this morning, Representative John B. Breaux of Louisiana, said later that there was ''agreement on recommending a strong Democratic tax package.'' Mr. Breaux, a member of the Conservative Democratic Forum, said of the members, ''Most are hanging loose and are not committed.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/12/business/inventor-trying-again-in-consumer-electronics.html": {"writer_name": "Elizabeth Bailey", "pub_date": "1981-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1208, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRYING AGAIN IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS", "print_headline": "INVENTOR; TRYING AGAIN IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS", "body_text": " **********LONDON The British, it is said, are great at designing a product but awful at exploiting it. In earlier eras, for example, much of the original work on the jet engine, the computer, radar and the early work on semiconductors was done in Britain. But the money on them was made elsewhere. **********Clive Sinclair seems living proof that the axiom holds true today.  In 1972, his Sinclair Radionics came out with the Executive, in a neck-and-neck race with Texas Instruments to market the world's first hand-held calculator. The Government poured millions into the venture. But it was swept away by a tide of cheaper, more sophisticated American and Japanese models. An economic artifact, the calculator now sits in the design gallery of New York's Museum of Modern Art. **********''The message has come through loud and clear that Sinclair is a good designer, but he is no good at running a business,'' said Richard Harwood, a financial analyst with the London-based brokerage firm Scott, Goff, Hancock & Company. **********That may be rather too hasty a judgment. Mr. Sinclair is back, as head of Sinclair Research, maker of a highly successful line of microcomputers -and now he has what he hopes will be truly a first.  It's pocket-sized television, a 6-by-4-by-1-inch black-and-white model that weighs only a few ounces. Again, he has Government support. And this time, Mr. Sinclair vows he is not going to repeat past mistakes. ''We aim to be first in the market - and stay in the market,'' he said. **********To get around production problems that have plagued other projects, Mr. Sinclair has contracted with Timex to produce both the minitelevisions and advanced microcomputers at the big watchmaker's Dundee, Scotland, plant. Marketing is expected to begin by the middle of next year. To avoid getting caught in the price trap again, he plans to sell the mini-televisions for just $100 or so. (An earlier model, announced in 1977, would have cost about $300.) Offices to direct promotion and sales (all mail order) have been opened in Boston, Munich and Paris. **********Mr. Sinclair, the son of a small London businessman who now works for him, quit school at the age of 17 to engage in several entrepreneurial fits and starts - running a small publishing company, making transistor radio kits and writing for a technical magazine. He set up Sinclair Radionics when he was 22, to assemble components for transistor radios and hi-fi's. **********Now 40, he firmly believes he will join the ranks of inventorsturned-entrepreneurs - like Edwin Land, inventor of the Polaroid instant camera -who prove capable of surviving in a world of high technology dominated by multinational companies with million-dollar research budgets. **********First, however, he must put behind him a track record that has won him a lot of critics.  Part of the problem is his own personality. Soon after introducing his hand-held calculator in 1972, for example, (the Executive cost the equivalent of $174 in 1972 and only performed five basic arithmetic functions) Mr. Sinclair began design work on his pet project, the pocket television, while at the same time throwing his small company behind the Black Watch, a digital wrist watch. **********''Clive gets ideas so fast that sometimes he does the last thing he thinks up before he finishes with the first,'' explained one electronics expert who has watched Mr. Sinclair's roller-coaster career. **********''Clive is not particularly prepared to listen to other people's ideas,'' added a former colleague, Christopher Curry, who has gone on his own to start the micro-computer company, Acorn. ''He is, in a word, irascible.'' **********Production of the Black Watch was held up for 18 important months because of problems with the supply of components. It finally began in 1975, but quietly died without a recouping of the initial investment. **********Sinclair Radionics had never become truly large - the company had sales of some $20 million in its best year - and by l976, Mr.  Sinclair was forced to seek outside financing in order to continue work on the pocket television. **********He turned first to the City, London's financial community, but he found no takers. So the National Enterprise Board, a Governmentfinanced organization designed to provide financing for high-risk ventures, bailed out the failing company. **********But Mr. Sinclair's highly individual style did not mix well with state capitalism. In 1979, Mr. Sinclair left, with a $22,000 ''golden handshake,'' his design team, and his ideas. The N.E.B. wrote off the venture as a $17 million loss. The financial community watched, with a note of self-congratulation. **********However, Mr. Sinclair promptly sold his house and his car (a collector's Rolls-Royce), set up Sinclair Research and began production of the ZX8O, an inexpensive, $199.95 microcomputer. He also managed to continue the Government connection with a $1 million grant from the state-controlled National Research and Development Corporation for development of the pocket television, in return for an undisclosed royalty. **********The lesson from the calculator battle did not go unheeded: ''We want to remain cheap enough to discourage Oriental competition,'' said Mr. Sinclair. ''There is, of course, always the problem in consumer electronics of being overtaken by cheaper products -we are making every effort to update our products.'' **********With that in mind, Sinclair recently announced the ZX81 (with four microchips compared with 22 in the earlier model) to go into production at Dundee this spring and be priced at retail for about $120. The newer model can also be hooked into a printer, for an additional $112. **********Mr. Sinclair is now producing 10,000 ZX80's a month, which puts him third in volume of personal computers, behind Apple and Tandy Radio Shack. **********His models, which rely on conventional television sets for their screens and cassette recorders to store the programs, are slower, have less memory, can handle far fewer commands and do less complex calculations than those of Apple and Tandy. That difference is, of course, reflected in price. A basic Apple model runs to more than $1,500. **********Mr. Sinclair is aiming at the novice who wants to learn his way around a computer rather than the small-business executive who wants storage and information processing capacity. **********''The Sinclair model has gadget appeal,'' said Gavin Embry, an electronics consultant. ''I have two, one to play with and one to take apart to see how it works.'' **********More than 50,000 ZX80's were sold in the first nine months of last year, more than half of them abroad, bringing the company $1.8 million in profits on $7 million in revenues. Mr. Sinclair says that he will soon be selling more units than either Apple or Tandy. **********And, typically, he has his eye on bigger things even than pocket television. ''We have already started a detailed design of an electric car,'' said Mr. Sinclair. ''Yes, I realize that General Motors is working on the same thing, but I'm not particularly nervous about that - and I'm sure that they are not very nervous about me, either. It's a case of mutual lack of nervousness.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/12/business/seagram-net-at-record.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seagram Net at Record", "print_headline": "Seagram Net at Record", "body_text": " **********Seagram Company Ltd.'s operating results set records for the threemonth and nine-month periods ended April 30, the company reported yesterday.

His earlier statement had brought criticism from anti-nuclear and pacifist groups in Western Europe. He also expressed confidence in Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and denounced news reports depicting ''chaos and disarray'' in Administration foreign policy as a disservice to the nation. **********The President may have provided new fuel for the controversy by appearing to suggest today that he was ''optimistic'' that such battlefield nuclear weapons could be used in Europe without leading to full-scale nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Reagan, under close questioning about his views on nuclear arms, added that he had not been able to find out if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had an optional battle plan calling for explosion of a nuclear device in a remote area of Europe as a ''warning shot'' to deter Soviet aggression. Reagan Criticizes News Accounts **********Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger have made conflicting statements about such a ''warning shot.'' While he did not clarify that issue, Mr. Reagan again criticized news accounts of disputes among his foreign policy advisers, saying ''the picture that has been given of chaos and disarray is a disservice to the country and to other countries and allies as well.'' **********''There is no animus, personal animus, and there is no bickering or back-stabbing going on,'' Mr. Reagan said when asked about the events of last week. ''We're a happy group.'' These included, in addition to the Haig-Weinberger dispute, a meeting at which the President ordered Mr. Haig and Richard V. Allen, the White House national security adviser, to end their policy disputes and personal feuding. **********''Well, I called them in, actually, to find out and to urge that they, with their staffs, just as I have with my own, insure that we're a little more careful,'' Mr. Reagan said, condemning ''loose talk'' of conflict that has ''been exaggerated out of all reality.'' He added, ''We are not in disarray with regard to foreign policy.'' 'Our Goal Is Peace' **********In his remarks on El Salvador, however, Mr. Reagan backed away from a reported effort by Mr. Haig to get the Pentagon to develop contingency plans for military action there. ''We have no plans for putting Americans in combat any place in the world and our goal is peace,'' Mr. Reagan said. **********Mr. Reagan sided with Mr. Haig in asserting that ''there may be something of a stalemate'' in El Salvador. That country's president, Jose Napoleon Duarte, yesterday protested this characterization of his Government's conflict with leftist guerrillas. He said Washington still hopes for a settlement based on free elections with all parties participating. **********On the issue of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe, Mr. Reagan first asserted that his initial comments on that issue on Oct. 6 had been misrepresented in ''second-hand'' accounts. He sought to avoid discussion of the issue by saying reporters should check the transcript of the Oct. 6 remarks. A few minutes later, a CBS News reporter produced a transcript of those remarks. At this point, Mr.  Reagan acknowledged that he had said it was possible that there could be a limited nuclear exchange in Europe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/25/world/in-moscow-summit-plan-is-viewed-as-hopeful-news-analysis.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1025, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Analysis", "print_headline": "IN MOSCOW SUMMIT PLAN IS VIEWED AS HOPEFUL...; News Analysis", "body_text": " **********One of the Soviet leadership's biggest complaints about Jimmy Carter was that he did not understand the uses of secrecy. Diplomatic initiatives, the men in the Kremlin used to say, cannot begin in public; they must be carefully explored in private beforehand. **********Now, to the consternation and confusion of Kremlin-watchers here, Leonid I. Brezhnev has done just what he accused Mr. Carter of doing. Apparently without warning to Washington or other Western capitals, he appealed yesterday for ''an active dialogue, at all levels,'' with the United States, including a meeting with President Reagan. **********He did it, moreover, on a great state occasion, in the keynote report that a Soviet leader presents only once every five years to the congress of the Communist Party. The setting gave his words added weight. He coupled his appeal with a series of proposals - some new, some old, some refurbished - that he said would help to relax EastWest tensions. Treaty Renegotiation Offered **********The most important of these, couched in murky terms but apparently intended as a distinct concession, is renegotiation of the second treaty on limitation of strategic nuclear arms. **********Mr. Brezhnev gave his speech a conciliatory tone, with few echoes of the polemics that have issued from Washington and Moscow alike in the last few weeks. He chose, for example, to make no riposte to Mr.  Reagan's rather sharp attack on the morality of the Soviet leadership. **********Instead, he seemed to be trying to picture himself and his colleagues in the ruling Politburo as seasoned politicians -which they no doubt are, with an average age of 68 - who understand the need for patience, restraint and, ultimately, communication rather than confrontation with the other superpower. **********It is easy enough to dismiss Mr. Brezhnev's effort as propaganda, and some Western diplomats immediately did so, arguing that nothing meant anything until the Soviet Union showed that it was ready to pull out of Afghanistan. One of them said, ''Russians don't float serious ideas at the United Nations or at Communist Party congresses.'' An Exception to the Rule Seen **********But there is persuasive evidence that yesterday's speech was the exception to the rule, that Mr. Brezhnev was in earnest about dialogue, and that he had good political reasons for being so. **********In little more than a year, the ailing leader has seen the Afghanistan move and Western worries about possible Soviet military intervention in Poland bring his policy of detente - the centerpiece of his career, by which he has said he wants to be remembered - to the very edge of extinction. **********Even Western Europeans, who clung to detente long after it fell from favor in the United States, have been expressing doubts. One more misstep, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany is said to have told Mr. Brezhnev, and that would be it for detente. **********What the 74-year-old Soviet leader told the party congress was designed, in part, to repair his relations with Bonn and Paris.  Slight but potentially significant changes in policy on Afghanistan and on the deployment of nuclear weapons in Europe seemed tailor-made to catch the eye of politicians like Mr. Schmidt. Statement Welcomed by European **********As one Western European diplomat said, ''I suppose they think they can reopen a gap between us and the Americans, but it is still a very welcome statement from our viewpoint.'' **********The speech was also a response to domestic imperatives. This is the year, in the prediction of Nikita S. Khrushchev, when the standard of living in the Soviet Union would surpass that in the West. Nothing of the sort has happened; food supplies are worse than they were three years ago, and the range and quality of consumer goods have improved little. Public grumbling is discreet but audible. **********Rectifying the situation will be difficult at best, given the rigidity of the bureaucracy. But it would seem impossible if the Kremlin felt compelled to undertake yet another armaments program. It is in this context that the bellicosity of some statements in Washington has caused distress here and has made the achievement of a new nuclear arms limitation treaty seem even more important. **********''They won't go broke without a new SALT treaty,'' a Communist from the third world said today, ''but they won't be able to deliver what they feel they must deliver to the average Soviet citizen.'' **********Mr. Brezhnev himself, in commenting on the economic problems of the Soviet Union and its allies, said yesterday: ''Our countries are having to deal with their constructive tasks in more complicated conditions. The deterioration of the world economy and spiraling prices are making themselves felt. The slowing of the detente process and the arms race imposed by the imperialist powers are no small burden for us as well.'' A Moment of Unusual Candor **********It was a moment of candor. Mr. Brezhnev must also have been aware that many party members, including lower-level officials, have been anxious about the acrimony between Washington and Moscow since Mr.  Reagan took office. Even to Western friends, such people have begun to express worry that perhaps the two countries are drifting toward war. Things seem to them to be getting out of control. **********In a sense then, Mr. Brezhnev appears to have spoken from a position of strategic weakness and vulnerability. But he also spoke from a position of formidable military strength; he could have chosen the occasion for a display of bluster. **********It was the emphasis on dialogue that caught the attention of diplomats here and politicians in the West and prompted them to take the speech more seriously than they took, for example, Mr. Brezhnev's proposals on the Persian Gulf in a speech in New Delhi last year. **********The summit proposal may have been primarily a device to dramatize the broader idea.

Kampelman, the head of the American delegation. **********''Our regret at recent developments is, therefore, a profound one,'' Mr. Kampelman said. ''Arbitrary detentions; interference with the free flow of information, ideas and people; the wholesale repression of civil liberties; the imposition of military control at the workplace; the use of violence against Polish workers, and the attempt to stifle and possibly destroy Solidarity, the legitimate expression of the yearning of Polish working men and women for dignity - all these represent gross violations of the Final Act.'' Talks Are Deadlocked **********The American delegate warned that any reversal of the Polish people's progress ''toward a more open and just society'' would ''inevitably damage'' the one-year-old negotiations in Madrid to broaden the Helsinki agreements. **********Deadlocked in the talks, the 33 European nations, Canada and the United States agreed today to reconvene in Madrid on Feb. 9 for one more month of work. **********Other Western nations joined in the criticism of the military crackdown in Poland. ''France now issues an appeal that the Polish trade unionists be freed and that civil liberties be restored,'' said Guy de Commines, the French delegate, who expressed the hope that ''the democratic conquests of the last months'' would be preserved. **********Talking to reporters, John Wilberforce, the British delegate who had spoken in the negotiating session on behalf of the 10 nations of the European Common Market, suggested that if the Soviet Union intervened in Poland, it would threaten the structure of the Helsinki accords, which Moscow has regarded as ratifying the post-World War II balance of power in Europe. **********''I think that one can conceive of some circumstances in which this conference would not continue at all,'' Mr. Wilberforce said. More Sorrow Than Anger **********There was an more-in-sorrow-than-anger quality to Western criticisms of the actions taken in Poland by Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski, who is widely regarded as being under heavy Soviet pressure. **********Wlodzimierz Konarski, the Polish delegate, attempted to turn this sympathy to his country's advantage by appealing for economic aid from nations that today criticized Warsaw. **********''There is no need to say that what is going on in Poland now is first of all a painful experience for all of us - that means all Poles,'' he said. ''What Poland needs most at this very moment is neither good advice nor an international debate on its problems, but understanding and economic assistance.'' **********In the closed-door session, Leonid F. Ilyichev, a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, repeated the Polish argument that the crackdown was an internal matter that should not be discussed at the Madrid talks.

The union had called the strikes with the unusual aim of getting the two companies to put pressure on a third, Firestone, to take back some dismissed employees. **********The solidarity strike began when two black workers at Ford's factory here were suspended for refusing to fit Firestone tires on a new car. It ended after Ford and General Motors rejected a demand from the union, the Motor Assemblies and Components Workers Union, that they hire some of the 160 men who lost their jobs four months ago after a wildcat walkout at Firestone. **********Late this afternoon, at a mass meeting attended by about 2,500 strikers, it was decided to accept Firestone's latest offer and return to work at all three companies on Monday, even though the offer fell far short of the union's demands. **********Although the effectiveness of the sympathy strike tactic had obviously been slight, it demonstrated the characteristics of this union that make it different from most of the longer-established black unions. These are its refusal to play by the intricate rules of the South African system of labor relations and its insistence on its right to act on behalf of the entire black community. **********When the pensions issue arose, it caught both the union, which had no standing at all at Firestone when the dispute began, and the management off guard. What triggered it was a proposed change in the pension law, which would have made it impossible for workers to draw out any of their pension funds before retirement. **********Mistrusting the Government and not wanting to lose access to the money they had put into the funds, the black workers demanded that it be paid out to them immediately. Firestone obtained a promise from the Government to exempt its workers from the proposed law, but this also was not trusted. **********Finally, after agreeing to pay back the workers' pension contributions the company demanded that they return to work. The workers said they would wait until the cash was in their hands, so Firestone tried a tactic that has been commonplace in South Africa in the year and a half since full trade union rights were extended to blacks - mass dismissals. **********Firestone set a date on which it said it would start hiring. By the time the workers had their pension money and were ready to return in early February, 160 places had been filled. It was then that the Motor Assemblies and Components Workers Union came on the scene on behalf, it said, not of its members but of the community of which they were a part. **********The union asked Ford and General Motors to stop using Firestone tires. They refused, so black workers struck at all three plants.  Under the offer the union accepted today, Firestone will take back 21 older workers who, the union charged, were dismissed because of their age. Others will be taken back as vacancies occur, while those who the company says have bad work records will become a subject for negotiation with the union. **********The most far-reaching effect of the strike is to harden the division of organized labor here into separate black, mixed-race and white unions at just the time when non-racial unionism is becoming legal in South Africa. Fred Sauls, leader of a multiracial union that was spurned by the blacks at Firestone, deplored the division of the work force on what he called a ''racialistic basis.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/16/world/turkish-journalist-convicted.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turkish Journalist Convicted", "print_headline": "Turkish Journalist Convicted", "body_text": " **********Nazli Ilicak, a top editorial writer for the right-wing Turkish daily newspaper Tercuman, was convicted of criticizing a court's rulings and was sentenced to nine months in prison, the newspaper reported today.

Other savings institutions and commercial banks said they were revising their pro- **********Chase Manhattan and First National of Chicago cut their prime rates half a point, to 20 percent. Page D1. grams in an attempt to meet what they believed were the IRS objections. **********The I.R.S. warning was that the tax-free status of the new ''All Savers'' certificates might be withdrawn for those sold in advance through the special high-interest programs. The agency said that the programs might distort the tax relief intended by Congress. Money Certificates Freed **********In another development, Federal regulators announced in Washington that holders of the popular six-month money market certificates, in denominations of $10,000 or more, could convert these funds into ''All Savers'' certificates after Oct. 1 without penalties for early withdrawals. (Page D19.) **********Most of the high interest rate packages, which the industry began to offer two weeks ago, promise customers interest rates now as as high as 40 percent on an annual basis until Oct. 1 on the condition that the money then be transferred to the one-year certificates. **********Some savings and loan associations had not required an automatic transfer into the new savings certificate. They said yesterday that they had dropped their advertising but would continue to sell the packages. **********Banks and savings and loans devised the ''All Savers'' repurchase programs to get a head start in the competition for the $250 billion that the new savings certificates are expected to attract when they become available Oct. 1. **********The higher the interest rate in the repurchase agreement for the weeks preceding Oct. 1, the higher the overall return would be on the final yield of the savings certificate if the two are treated as one package. **********The Chase Manhattan Bank, which was the first to suspend its tiein package on Sunday, said that on Wednesday it would begin to offer a similiar package that it believed would protect the consumer and get the approval of the I.R.S. **********Fred Hammer, executive vice president of Chase, said that the bank would offer its customers a repurchase agreement at a 15 percent interest rate, which is the market rate, instead of the 40 percent interest rate it had offered last week. The repurchase agreement, essentially a customer loan to the bank, will mature at the end of September and the customer can then decide to either withdraw the funds or deposit them in an ''All Savers'' certificate. **********''If the I.R.S. rules that we can offer the higher interest rate then we will rewrite the agreements,'' Mr. Hammer added. Sold at Varying Rates **********Repurchase agreements are regularly sold by banks at varying interest rates to raise money. These rates usually are in line with prevailing market rates, but never as high as the interest rates that have been offered in recent weeks in the competition to attract funds for the ''All Savers'' certificates. The repurchase agreements are generally sold in large denominations and have a longer maturity period. **********Ellen Murphy of the I.R.S. said that each package would have to be considered individually, but that the agency seemed to have the most problems with tie-in packages that required the customer to buy a savings certificate. She would not say for certain, however, that packages that did not require an automatic tie-in, such as the Chase plan, would be allowed. **********There was uncertainty yesterday as to what might happen to customers who had already signed up for one of the tie-in packages that have been offered nationwide. Most banks, however, expressed confidence that the repurchase accounts already signed up for would be permitted. The total invested so far nationwide is not known. **********The I.R.S. questions on the tie-in accounts seemed to be focused on whether they violate the intent of the new tax law. The statute stipulates that the savings certificates be issued after Sept. 30 and that the interest rate paid on the savings certificates be equal to 70 percent of the average investment yield on one-year Treasury bills. Increase Yield and Time **********Since the tie-in packages begin before Oct. 1 and for a short period of time offer higher annnual interest rates, they would increase both the yield and the effective time period of the savings certificate. **********The savings certificate program, which is part of the Reagan Administrations tax relief program, will permit individuals to earn up to $1,000 interest tax-free and married couples up to $2,000. Most tax experts believe that the certificates make the most sense for a person above the 30 percent tax bracket. **********'At this point you can't get a straight answer from anyone,'' said Raymond O'Brien, chairman of the Emigrant Savings Bank in New York .  ''The I.R.S. should have had the regulations out long before this.'' **********He added that although Emigrant would drop its advertising drive, it would continue to sell the repurchase agreements. ''We don't think the I.R.S. will have a problem with the packages that don't have a forced tie-in,'' he said. Dime to Discontinue Ads **********The Dime Savings Bank, which does not have an automatic tie-in, will also continue to sell the agreements but will discontinue its ads until the I.R.S. issues a ruling. **********''We pulled the ads and won't sell the packages again until after the I.R.S. makes its rulings,'' W. Barton Cummings, senior vice president of the Dry Dock Savings Bank, said. ''I seriously don't think that the I.R.S. can take the tax-exempt status away from the accounts that have already been opened.'' **********The Dollar Federal Savings and Loan Association and the Lincoln Savings Bank have also suspended their programs.  The American Savings and Loan Association in California plans to continue to offer its tie-in packges, which promise the depositor a 20 percent interest rate between now and Oct. l. If the account is not transferred to a savings certifcate the customer would only receive a 17 percent interest rate. **********''Until they come out with a ruling we are going to assume that the packages will be allowed,'' said Charles Dorsey of American Savings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/02/business/market-place-niagara-share-s-foreign-focus.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1981-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 777, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Niagara Share's Foreign Focus", "print_headline": "Market Place; Niagara Share's Foreign Focus", "body_text": " **********THE Wing Lung Bank Ltd. and Sime Darby Holdings Ltd. are not exactly household names even to institutional investors, but these stocks are among the holdings of the Niagara Share Corporation.

We de-emphasized investment in European companies in 1977.'' **********Niagara Share, which began picking up foreign stocks in 1958, usually maintains a fully invested position in the market.

''These good results were in large part due to the natural resource and electronics portions of the portfolio.'' **********Value Line offered these additional comments: ''Niagara Share uses interesting investment strategies. Though its holdings are scattered among about 20 industry classifications, the fund tends to bunch up much of its assets in certain areas. Right now, for example, resource stocks outweigh technology and general industry categories, and there are no holdings in retailing issues.'' **********In 1980, the net asset value per share at Niagara Share rose 42.5 percent. This compared with a gain of 31.6 percent for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********Several other closed-end funds, including the Madison Fund and General American Investors, have performed well relative to the broad market and to the rate of inflation. Typically, a fund with a good record tends to sell closer to its net asset value per share, while laggards in the group often sell at a discount on the Big Board. **********However, in periods of sharply depressed stock prices, some investors purchase shares of closed-end companies trading at substantial discounts, hoping that these diversified portfolios will benefit by a market rebound. **********Meanwhile, it must be emphasized that favorable past performance offers no guarantee of future results for a closed-end investment company. **********Nevertheless, Value Line stated that the ''internationalization of Niagara Share's portfolio will help its performance over the long pull, while the portfolio also will benefit from the heavy flow of Mideast oil money into foreign stock markets.'' **********For the next 12 months, the investment advisory service has rated Niagara Share as an average performer in terms of the overall market. **********Some of the fund's other foreign holdings at the end of the year included Genting Bhd.

He had spent the intervening years in rigorous and remote mountain camps, ostensibly to be reeducated for service to the new Laos, and five months in Vientiane realizing that his services were not wanted. **********Still not angry, still uncomplaining, the French-educated official, now 51 years old, consented to have his story told only if his name was withheld. He explained that he did not want his escape to be depicted and politically exploited as an act of opposition. **********Recalling the earlier conversation, the soft-spoken Laotian said he had stayed when many of his friends fled because he believed that Laos, under whatever government, would need the services of those who had been trained in the skills needed to develop a country without industry or roads that are passable throughout the year. He Expected to Be Mistrusted **********He said then that he knew he would have to pay a price for his decision. As a member of the ''wrong'' social class, married to a Frenchwoman, he expected to be mistrusted and to have to prove his good faith before being allowed to contribute fully to the development of Laos. **********But he said that as leader of a small movement of intellectuals who had fought against the corruption of the old regime and the excessive power of certain generals, he would betray his previous stand if he left with the onset of the Communist regime. **********A few weeks after the 1975 conversation, the official was summoned to attend a ''seminar,'' the Laotian euphemism for detention without charges or trial, and with no limit to the term of confinement, of people distrusted by the Communist Government.

They wanted to make Communists of us.'' **********''I tried to do what I could to understand their politics,'' he continued. ''I knew that if I wanted to be allowed to work in their society, I would have to understand this.'' 'A New Patriotism' **********The former official described the Communist supervisors and instructors in sympathetic terms, as people who believed in what they were saying and in the justice of what they were doing. He said they shared the hardships and deprivations of their prisoners' lives and committed no brutalities. **********Political instruction was rudimentary, with barely educated peasants teaching men of advanced education what the former official described as ''a new patriotism, in which the Communist Party demanded that all Laotians voluntarily accept its authority over all aspects of their lives.'' He said the party was depicted as infallible, and those who doubted it as swimming against the flow of history. **********Prisoners had to form cells of 10 men to discuss the political lessons, engage in criticism of themselves and each other, and write again and again the story of their lives in the light of the new teaching. ''My hope was that eventually this Marxism-Leninism would take on a specific Laotian form and in this adaptation would make it possible for all of us to construct our country,'' the official explained. **********His wife, a pediatrician, remained in Vientiane, awaiting his return and hoping, by working at a hospital and teaching at the medical faculty, to speed his liberation. In 1978, when France broke relations with Laos, the Laotian authorities made it evident that they wanted her to leave. She rejoined their sons at school in France. Long Stretches Without News **********Her letters and packages reached him only occasionally, and there were long stretches when the couple were without news of each other.  Last January, the former official was told that he was being ''reassigned to Vientiane.'' At a farewell lunch, the political commissar told him he would be put to work in the capital, at a lesser job and with lower pay than in the past. He arrived, eager to go to work and assuming that he was now considered ''reeducated'' and acceptable to the authorities. **********His wife was allowed to visit him for two weeks.  ''I think I disappointed her badly,'' he said. ''She thought that she would find me like a victim of Hitler's concentration camps, bitter and above all eager to leave my country. Instead, I told her I was waiting to be put to work and asked her to apply for a job that would bring her back to Laos.'' **********The former official's most bitter disappointment came in his last months in Laos, when he was free in Vientiane, with nothing to do but occasionally translate for friends in ministries and bring his tennis game up to its old form. 'We Had Been Forgotten' **********He learned that the five and a half years of imprisonment that he believed had been a preparation for being useful to Laos had been mere imprisonment. No one in Vientiane knew what his capacities were, and no one intended to employ his skills. **********''For five and a half years, I saw an image of a Laos that was poor, lacking everything, but led by people who would finally lead the Laotian people to a prosperous and honorable future,'' he said sadly but without bitterness. **********''I was wrong. We had been forgotten, and in Vientiane I found no creative enthusiasm, nor any of the new solidarity we had heard about in the camp. Then I thought of the sadness of my wife and children.'' **********Last month, six years to the month after his decision not to join the exodus, the former official slid down the bank to the riverside and swam to Thailand."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/01/business/advertising-creamer-dickson-offers-women-s-clubs-report.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Creamer Dickson Offers Women's Clubs Report", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Creamer Dickson Offers Women's Clubs Report", "body_text": " **********Since 1945 Creamer Dickson Basford, or its predecesor public relations firms, has found the women's clubs of the nation an ideal outlet for ''business-sponsored materials.'' **********The clubs, the agency feels, are a ''microcosm of the maturity market.'' **********So C.D.B. did a survey of 1,000 of the members and on the basis of their responses has compiled a Report on Members of Women's Clubs that is available at the Creamer Inc. subsidiary at 1633 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10019. **********''The typical respondent,'' C.D.B. said, ''is a mature upscale consumer who is financially comfortable and often employed.''

A good example is the agreement between the United States and Japan, signed in the waning days of 1980, permitting sales of American telecommunications equipment to the mammoth Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********Although the new agreement may pave the way for joint AmericanJapanese research ventures that could help the participants move into the forefront of telecommunications development, it came only after three years of difficult, tense negotiation - an indication of the importance Japan places on protecting its advanced-technology industries. **********Government-owned Nippon Telephone, bestowed with the monopoly for providing telecommunications services to the Japanese, purchases $3.5 billion of equipment annually - ranging from utility poles to sophisticated switching apparatus. But in line with longstanding Japanese policy, the company gave all of its business only to Japanese suppliers. **********The situation was not unique. Post office and telephone monopolies exist in most countries of Western Europe and also operate under buynational purchasing policies. **********Thus, as in Japan, the governments of industrialized Europe both guarantee domestic companies demand for advanced technology products and provide much of the money for research and development through foreign exchange, fiscal and monetary policies and direct grants. **********In information processing, semiconductors, and microelectronics the story is much the same in most of the industrial coutries - active government intervention supports the expansion of domestic hightechology companies. **********The common theme behind these efforts is to develop advanced industries that will provide the jobs being lost in traditional manufacturing sectors that are facing stiff competition from developing nations. But the policy also stymies the efforts of American technology companies, which do not enjoy similar government support, to break into foreign markets. **********In addition to that disadvantage, spending by United States companies on research and development, a crucial sector for hightechnology industries, has lagged behind the principal competition. Although the United States research effort is still larger in absolute terms than in most other countries, spending has declined as a percentage of total output since 1961. **********In the same period, similar spending by West Germany increased by 80 percent. In Japan, the growth was 40 percent, while France's remained roughly constant and Britain's declined. **********According to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States accounted for 60 percent of the total expenditures on research and development in 1970 by all 24 members of the institution. By 1978, the percentage had fallen to 50 percent. **********''U.S. firms have fallen badly behind in the rate of productive investment and technological improvement, and are now falling behind in absolute levels as well,'' William V. Rapp, vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said. **********This trend, coupled with the efforts of foreign governments to protect their technology industries, has meant that, over the last decade, the United States role as an exporter of manufactured goods had steadily shrunk. **********While the three leading competitors of the United States - West Germany, Japan and France - all increased their shares of manufactured exports during the decade, the United States share fell from 21.3 percent in 1970 to 17.4 percent in 1979. **********This has raised calls from United States manufacturers for broader Government emphasis on trade policy.  ''Domestically, it is essential to develop policies and programs which will enhance the competitive capabilities of export-oriented industries,'' Lawrence A. Fox, vice president for international affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers, said. **********In terms of trade policy, the United States' arguments are more with Japan than with Europe. The basic reason is that the United States still enjoys a healthy trade surplus with Europe, while it runs ever-mounting deficits with Japan. **********What has taken place in one high-technology sector, the manufacture of semiconductors, illustrates the problems between the two countries. **********Like telecommunications, semiconductors are favored by Japanese industrial policy, which means the Government helps fund research and development. **********Furthermore, the Japanese companies can carry a much higher debtto-capital ratio than United States banks consider sound, which means the actual cost of capital is reduced. Under the Japanese system of Government subsidies and low interest rates, it is cheaper to borrow from a bank than to raise capital from stockholders who expect to be rewarded with a stream of dividends. **********In the case of semiconductors, competition from the subsidised Japanese companies in the United States forced many small- and medium-size United States companies to cut prices, thus reducing profitability. The reduced profits shrank the capital available for development, making it harder for the American companies to compete. **********As a result, the Semiconductor Industry Association, which is made up of independent companies (such as Motorola, Intel, Fairchild and Advanced Micro Devices, but not the bigger companies like International Business Machines and Texas Instruments) sought advice about filing a petition with the Federal Government for import protection. **********The group approached Alan W. Wolff, a former deputy American trade negotiator and now with a Washington law firm that represents the association. He dissuaded the trade association on two counts: **********First, there seem to be reasonably good chances of getting tax credits for research as well as other investment incentives from the new Congress. **********Second, and perhaps more important, the Government is making progress on convincing the Japanese to open their market to American high-technology exports, including semiconductors, as the agreement on telecommunications exports shows."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/06/business/back-to-work.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 768, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Back To Work", "print_headline": "Back To Work", "body_text": " **********As the financial markets keep sliding in the aftermath of the Reagan tax and budget-cutting victories, Congress and the Administration return to work this week with much to do, and little time to get it done. **********Wall Street and Washington analysts say that in order to prevent what could be just a temporary downturn from getting much worse, the executive and legislative branches need to come up with a coordinated stategy. The problem, these analysts say, is that while both branches seem aware that quick action is necessary, there is little agreement on what needs to be done. **********After a month off, Congress is likely to renew its push for a relaxation of the Fed's tough money policies which it thinks would ease burgeoning Federal deficits and stimulate economic growth. The Administration, on the other hand, currently seems to feel that additional budget cuts will convince the financial markets it means business. According to Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist at Chase Econometrics, both efforts are necessary - and even that may not be enough. **********Slower Credit Growth **********Detriot's rebate programs have lured consumers into auto showrooms this quarter, a development which should be reflected in higher consumer debt figures this week. Even so, analysts say high interest rates are causing people to postpone purchases, and save. Elizabeth Allison, an economist at Data Resources, says high interest rates are not the only deterrent to rising indebtedness. Recent declines in the stock market have led to a reduction in net worth, dampening the inclination to take on new debt. Outside of autos, that's bad news for durable goods manufacturers. Mrs. Allison currently expects sales of durable goods to grow at less than 1 percent in real terms in the third quarter, with a slight uptick in the fourth. As long as interest rates remain high, private credit demand should not be expected to pick up, Mrs. Allison says. After this quarter, when new installment debt is forecast to rise 12 percent, to $356 billion at an annual rate, the quarterly annualized rates of increase remain well below that figure. After inflation is accounted for, the rate of increase is likely to be only 1 or 2 percent through the end of 1982.  Clear Track for Railroads **********In most businesses, a slack economy and a protracted strike in an important client's industry often mean red ink. Such is not the case for the nation's major railroads. Nearly a year after deregulation, business is brisk. **********Richard Fischer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, says two elements of last year's deregulation legislation have been particularly helpful.  Greater rate-setting flexibility and a cost recovery provision allow companies to recoup costs attributable to inflation on a quarterly basis. And the ability to set contract rates gives railroads the opportunity to woo types of traffic they had lost in the past for long-term hauling. With coal traffic fully recovered from the strike and a bumper crop forecast, the outlook for the rest of 1981 seems even brighter. **********Although forecasts of further weakness in the economy next year could harm profitability, Andras R. Petery of Morgan Stanley notes that accelerated depreciation schedules will prove beneficial. At the moment, Mr. Petery projects earnings for the 10 major railroads will reach $1.6 billion this year, up 19 percent from 1980 levels. Japanese Trade Revives **********A year ago, rising oil bills pushed Japan's current account into an $11 billion deficit. And, with opposition rising against further penetration in auto markets, additional deterioration seemed likely. **********That is not happening. During the past year, Japanese export strategy has shifted markedly, and led to an export boom that some analysts think might trigger a new wave of protectionist sentiment in foreign markets. High rates of interest in the U.S. have helped weaken the value of the yen again st the dollar, and Japan's central bank has done little to restore th e balance. With major industrial country markets reluctant to accept more of the country's products, its steel and auto producer s, among others, have redoubled efforts in d e veloping countries. In Western markets, the Japanese are now concen trating on selling sophisticated and expensive products that currentl y arouse less protectionist alarm. **********Roger Bird, director of the Wharton Econometrics forecasting model, says these shifts should translate into a current account swing of at least $12 billion this year, and projects a surplus of $2 billion to $3 billion in 1982. **********Kenneth N.

The goal is to raise domestic ownership of Canada's petroleum industry to 50 percent by 1990 from 28 percent today. **********Government planners hope that many huge foreign energy companies, such as Exxon, Gulf, Texaco, Acquitaine, Chevron and British Petroleum, will sell all or part of their Canadian subsidiaries to Canadian companies, including Petro-Canada, the state oil company.  The federal Government is using Petro-Canada to gain its own substantial share of the oil business. **********''Despite all their denials,'' said one Canadian investment banker, ''we now regard all foreign oil companies as fair game.'' Hudson's Bay Control Shifts **********Just this week Dome Petroleum, an aggressive, acquisition-minded Canadian concern that began in 1950 as a resource investment arm for the endowment funds of Harvard, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, won a wrestling match with the United States' Conoco Inc. for control of the Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Company, Canada's No.2 natural gas producer. **********In February, Petro-Canada spent $1.4 billion to buy the Canadian subsidiary of Belgium's Petrofina S.A. In April, the St. Joe Minerals Corporation sold its Canadian oil and gas subsidiary, Candel Oil Ltd., to a Canadian company, Sulpetro Ltd., as part of its defense against a takeover by Canada's giant cash-rich distiller, Seagram's.  Union Oil of California has announced that it is selling its oil and gas holdings in Canada. **********In a possible repeat of the Dome-Conoco struggle, the Nu-West Group Ltd., of Calgary, Alberta, has purchased more than 6 percent of the stock of the Cities Service Company. Many analysts expect the Canadian company to increase its holdings in the parent American company and then offer to trade those shares for control of Cities Service's Canadian subsidiary. **********Cities Service, in a lawsuit filed against Nu-West in Tulsa, Okla., charges that the Canadian Government's energy policies have created an economic and political environment in which some Canadian companies can put pressure on American companies to sell their Canadian operations at less than market value. Lower earnings projections as a result of the new energy taxes have also depressed share prices here, making them even more attractive bargains. Hiram Walker Purchase **********In January, Hiram Walker-Consumers Home Ltd., a giant liquor, energy and utility company here, bought $600 million worth of United States oil and gas properties from the Davis Oil Company of Denver. **********There have been signs of growing Congressional concern over the mounting aggressiveness of Canadian energy companies. Both the Carter and Reagan Administrations warned Canadian officials that Canada's energy program, yet to be fully legislated, threatens to increase economic frictions between the two countries, both each other's largest trading partner. Under American law and the principle of reciprocity, restrictions can be imposed on foreign companies operating on Federal lands whose homeland restricts American companies operating there. **********Mr. Trudeau's energy policy, Canada's latest preoccupation with economic nationalism, is not without domestic opponents, many of whom are critical of increased energy taxes used to finance billion-dollar buyouts that change ownership papers but produce no more oil. **********''The notion that foreign ownership is bad ownership,'' said Rowland Frazee, chairman of the Royal Bank, Canada's largest, ''and that we can penalize it retroactively, as contained in the National Energy Program, is living dangerously, damaging Canada's reputation abroad and fomenting wasteful bickering at home. It must be changed.'' Financing Affected **********The energy plan, combined with other incidents of economic resource nationalism such as Saskatchewan's potash takeover and Quebec's threatened expropriation of General Dynamics' Asbestos Corporation, has hurt Canada's ability to raise foreign funds for investments, including billions needed for frontier oil exploration. **********According to Brian Gilmer, a corporate finance officer for A.E Ames & Company Ltd., a major investment house here, ''A lot of General Dynamics board members take these experiences back to their own companies. The bad reputation spreads - 'I got stomped in Canada, why bother?' -and you can bet it'll be a while before they come piling back into Canada.'' **********Overall American investment here is at a steady level or declining slightly. The Amoco Minerals Company, a unit of Standard Oil (Indiana), is offering its 63 percent slice of the Cyprus Anvil Mining Corporation for sale to Canadians while Amoco Canada Petroleum cut its exploration budget 56 percent. **********While recent takeover activity has aroused much attention, it has actually been under way for years, lowering foreign ownership of Canada's petroleum industry to 72 percent from a high of 80 percent.  In 1976, Petro-Canada bought Atlantic Richfield Canada for $320 million. In 1979, it bought Phillips Petroleum's Canadian operations, Pacific Petroleums Ltd. And in 1978-79, the Nova Corporation, formerly Alberta Gas Trunk Line, took over Husky Oil. Moving Into American Markets **********Most analysts see the energy takeovers as part of a larger swing of the North American economic pendulum toward the United States, a tempting market 10 times the size of Canada's. It is proving a powerful lure to Canadian investors, manufacturers, real estate operators, insurance companies, brewers, banks, cable television companies and energy corporations. **********The energy companies were especially spurred by the start of oil deregulation in the United States in 1979. Some Canadian companies like Bow Valley Industries Ltd. may not even use all their government incentives because American deals look better. **********''Businessmen are not all that ideological,'' Mr. Gilmer said. ''A $30 barrel of oil found in the United States just looks a lot better than an $11 barrel in Canada.'' **********Continuous federal-provincial bickering over energy prices has created considerable economic uncertainty in Canada while export restrictions and high export prices help create a natural gas surplus keeping many new gas finds shut in the ground for years. **********''In Texas,'' Mr. Gilmer said, ''a long shut-in is two weeks. I know one utility laid pipes right to the drill site. I couldn't even guess at the Canadian money that's flowed into Texas, the Rockies and Michigan.'' **********In fact, Mr. Gilmer's Canadian firm recently held an investment seminar on oil prospects in the United States for its institutional investor clients.

Buckley declared today that sales of American weapons abroad ''complement and supplement our own defense efforts and serve as a vital and constructive instrument of American foreign policy.'' **********Speaking before the Aerospace Industries Association in Williamsburg, Va., Mr. Buckley presented a general framework for President Reagan's new policy on arms sales. Specific guidelines will be made public early next week, according to Administration officials. **********Mr. Buckley said today that while the Carter Administration considered arms sales ''inherently evil or morally reprehensible,'' the Reagan Administration would use weapons transfers as one way of ''facing up to the realities of Soviet aggrandizement.'' **********''Arms transfers can thus serve as an important adjunct to our own security,'' Mr. Buckley said, ''by helping deter acts of aggression, by enhancing the self-d@efense capabilities of nations with which we share close ties, and by facilitating access by American forces to military facilities abroad.'' Buckley Outlines Policy Goals **********According to Mr. Buckley, the goals of the policy include enhancing the ''state of preparedness of our friends and allies,'' revitalizing American alliances, fashioning ''more coherent'' policies and strategies that affect East-West relations and ''buttressing our own defense production capabilities.'' **********He denied that the new policy would herald a period of unrestrained arms sales abroad. But he added that the Administration would give the ''highest priority'' to requests for arms from ''members of our major alliances and from those nations with whom we have developed cooperative relations.'' **********In assessing other requests, the Administration will consider the military threat facing the recipient, how the weapons would serve to maintain stability in regions where there are tensions, and whether the arms could be absorbed by the recipient, Mr. Buckley said. **********''For this reason, we are prepared to encourage the efforts of American manufacturers to produce equipment which, in terms of cost, complexity and sophistication, is more appropriate to the needs of nonindustrial nations,'' he said. Carter Policy Is Rescinded **********This morning, in one of his first actions to put the new policy into effect, Mr. Buckley rescinded the Carter Administration's instructions to United States officials abroad not to assist American arms merchants. Mr. Buckley said American Government representatives abroad would instead be ''expected to provide the same courtesies and support'' to companies selling arms as to those marketing any other product. **********Mr. Buckley also disavowed the concept of one-sided restraint in arms sales. But he said that the Administration would ''continue to examine ways to secure multilateral restraint.'' **********The policy outlined by Mr. Buckley has been under review for more than two months and was recently approved by an interagency group led by the State Department. **********The new position essentially reverses the Carter Administration's six-point policy on arms sales issued May 19, 1977. In that policy statement, President Carter introduced broad measures to restrict overseas weapons sales, calling them an ''exceptional'' instrument of foreign policy to be used only when it could be ''clearly demonstrated that the arms transfer contributes to our national security.'' **********Despite the proclamation of the new policy, however, the Carter Administration did not completely restrain conventional arms exports. American sales abroad totaled $10.6 billion in 1976 and $10.3 billion in 1979, but arms deliveries rose from $4.8 billion to $5.7 billion in the same years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/11/business/us-speeds-oil-leasing-offshore.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 604, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. SPEEDS OIL LEASING OFFSHORE", "print_headline": "U.S. SPEEDS OIL LEASING OFFSHORE", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration today outlined a plan to step up substantially the pace at which the Government leases offshore oil and gas properties. **********Six additional sales would be made over the next five years, and procedures would be streamlined so that the time required to prepare a lease for bids would be cut to about 18 months from two or three years currently. **********''This action hastens the day when America's offshore oil reserves are better known and evaluated,'' Energy Secretary James B. Edwards told a news conference at which he appeared with Interior Secretary James G. Watt. ''We cannot know what domestic energy sources are available to us until we inventory the resources - and that means exploratory drilling in offshore areas.'' **********Only One California Basin **********At the same time, however, the Administration withdrew its February proposal to include in a lease sale late next month four basins off California that have been the object of concern by environmentalists. Only the Santa Maria Basin, which has an estimated oil-equivalent potential four times that of the other basins combined, would be put up for bids. **********A decision on whether leasing all or part of the lesser basins - Eel River, Point Arena, Bodega and Santa Cruz -is in the national interest is scheduled for late May or June, the Administration said. **********''It sounds like a temporary reprieve, but I'd rather have a pardon,'' said Representative Leon Panetta, a California Democrat whose district includes many miles of coastline. 42 Sales Now Planned **********The 42 proposed sales during 1982-86 compares with the current schedule of 36 for the five-year period ending in June 1985. **********The bulk of the increased activity will be off the shore of Alaska, where the sales are about doubled, to 16.

A few caveats are in order. Make sure you answer all questions on the application. Be careful about estimates of how much gas you expect to use. Take pains to see that your previous credit performance is up to par. And be accurate - a tough computer is watching and scoring you. **********Don't be disappointed if you are rejected. Oil companies generally turn down as many as 50 percent of all applications. Recently, rising fraud, theft of cards and delinquency have made the companies more careful about credit authorization. **********Most companies, such as Amoco, a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company (Indiana), and the Shell Oil Company, use scoring systems to evaluate applicants' answers and may say no if the total falls below an acceptable level. **********Recently, Mary Derrington, head of the mathematics department at Mineola High School, in Mineola, L.I., was rejected by Amoco because she failed to clear the point-scoring minimum. Reason: Amoco, through a spokesman in Chicago, said it was because she had estimated that her 1971 Camero (having already traveled about 85,000 miles) used about $150 worth of gasoline a month. Amoco said that would amount to at least 100 gallons a month. ''Our computer said that $150 worth of gas a month was too much for a car of that age to consume,'' Amoco's spokesman said. **********Miss Derrington explained in an interview that she had included the cost of repairs and the buying of equipment such as tires in her estimate because she also uses credit cards to pay for such costs. **********She estimated that she generally drove about 20 miles a day from her home to her school and back. She argued that her estimate of her gas costs should not be the basis for rejection, but that the decision should be made on her credit rating and her history of paying her debts. **********Amoco said it had also turned down a Congressman who listed his bank account but not his salary.''The lady missed passing the scoring test by just one point,'' the company added. ''If she had estimated a lower figure, she might well have gotten her application approved.'' **********In a letter explaining why she was rejected, Amoco listed other reasons besides the estimate of gas purchases. It mentioned the age of her vehicle, her state of residence and the type of housing in relation to the number of dependents. (She's single, has no dependents and lives in an apartment.) On state of residence, Amoco said in the letter, ''Marketing considerations and/or the delinquency rate we have experienced prompt us to require a higher total score for approval in your state.'' **********Miss Derrington, however, is angry. ''Why should the age of my vehicle be considered a mark against me?'' she demands. ''If I promised to purchase a brand-new car, American-made, of course, would this remove the first blot from my family escutcheon? Why am I penalized for living in New York State? I care not for the delinquency of others. I concern myself with my personal record. And of what importance is my type of housing and the question regarding the number of dependents? Is it improper or second-rate if I rent an apartment as opposed to owning a home?'' **********She concludes: ''It would seem that my past record of so many years with my landlord and other credit card companies plus 19 years in the teaching profession should lend some credence to my status of acceptability.'' **********Oil companies in general tend to withhold information about their credit card business, saying that such information is competitive.  But it is clear that rising fraud in credit card use is making them all more cautious. Delinquencies are up as well. Shell, for example, says: ''We feel that there are 4,000 fraud attempts made every day at Shell stations. Each month, about 7,000 Shell credit cards or stolen or lost. All that makes the oil companies very sensitive about credit card use.'' **********Shell has 5.5 million to six million credit accounts, and, since many families have several cards in use on one account, it estimates it has about 10 million credit cards outstanding. **********Amoco says: ''We certainly find that bad debts are a substantial cost of doing business. As a result, our credit people are continually attempting to have the computer predict more accurately.'' **********Are the oil companies getting tougher on credit authorization? Both Amoco and Shell deny it. They tightened terms a year ago when credit controls were put into effect but have not toughened them since. **********In most cases, oil companies demand payment in 30 days and charge annual interest rates from 12 percent up, depending on state laws, on the unpaid balance. Revolving credit is allowed on purchases up to $300, with a minimum monthly payment of $25 if the account is more than $200. On purchases of more than $300, the difference must be paid in full at the time of billing. **********Exxon USA, which reports that it approves slightly more than 50 percent of its applications, says insufficient credit references are the biggest reason for rejections.

So I decided to take the job of Pan Am chairman.'' **********With that quip Charles Edward Acker, chairman of Air Florida, explained why he had accepted an offer from the board of the foundering Pan American World Airways to assume its chairmanship Sept. 1, replacing William T. Seawell. **********Considered by his colleagues as a feisty airline marketer who has never been afraid to take a run at his larger competitors, the 52-year-old Mr. Acker brings to the job long experience in finance and a devotee's knowledge of every aspect of the airline trade. His friends say that his favorite reading is his dog-eared Official Airline Guide of route schedules, which he constantly thumbs through in search of new cities to connect. 'Calls on All Your Skills' **********''Once you get hooked on the airline business it's worse than dope,'' Mr. Acker said in an interview. ''It's awful hard to get out. It's got everything you would want for excitement: a capitalintensive, labor-intensive, around-the-clock service business. It calls on all your skills as an executive.'' **********Mr. Acker has spent the last four years satisfying his airline addiction as chairman of Air Florida, which he converted from an obscure intrastate carrier into what many consider to be the most innovative and fastest-growing fleet in the nation. His techniques became the talk of the industry. But his aggressive, expansionary management style has brought him into conflict at times with more than a few competing airlines, not to mention the Federal Government. **********Mr. Acker stepped down as president of Braniff Airways in 1975 on the heels of a Federal investigation of Braniff officials for illegally distributing airline tickets worth about $1 million to travel agents in Latin America. Some of the proceeds were said to have been contributed to President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 election campaign. Mr. Acker and the company's chairman, Harding L. Lawrence, were among the Braniff officials who were named in a settlement with the Civil Aeronautics Board. The airline paid a $300,000 penalty. **********Born in Dallas on April 7, 1929, Mr. Acker received his B.A. in economics and psychology from Southern Methodist University in 1950.  He has been using his twin degree ever since. **********''The key to success in the airline business,'' said Mr. Acker, outling his operating philosophy, ''is determining what customers want in each different market and how best to give it to them. That's what we did at Air Florida. For the customers looking for value we offered a single, unrestricted fare that was the lowest on the market. For the businessman we offered frequency of flights to key cities. And we did it all in an uncomplicated fashion that everyone could understand - no 'Super-Savers,' no 45 days in advance, just one fare all the time.'' Joined Air Florida in 1977 **********Mr. Acker joined the foundering Air Florida in 1977 as chairman, bringing with him cash from a group of Dallas investors who were prepared to bet he could turn the airline around. He had worked in investment counseling and finance for a variety of Dallas companies between 1952 and 1965, before joining Braniff Airways where he eventually rose to president in 1970. After his departure, he worked as an executive of a financial holding company until joining Air Florida. **********For the small regional airline, Edward Acker proved to be the right man at the right time. In 1978, the airline industry was deregulated and Mr. Acker became known among his colleagues as the ''darling of deregulation.'' The unshackling of the airline business allowed Air Florida to break out of its Miami-Tampa pattern into lucrative routes to the Northeast United States and Europe, and it allowed Mr. Acker to let his entrepreneurial instincts run riot. He scrapped the carrier's gas-guzzling Boeing 707's for the more efficient 737's, cut every other cost corner he could find and began flying, with a Miami hub, routes that stretched from Texas to Amsterdam. **********''But his reach never exceeded his grasp,'' said Simeon R.  Trotter, an airlines analyst with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, a Dallas brokerage firm. ''He was always able to combine ambitious growth with the financial controls to pull it off.'' 'Free Rides for a Kiss' **********His tenure at Air Florida will surely be remembered for such marketing innovations as ''Free Rides for a Kiss'' - a promotion that gave customers a free trip if they kissed an airline employee - that was introduced in the highly competitive Florida-Texas market.  Another lure was the orange juice and champagne elixer, called the ''Sunshine Sparkler'' that the airline served to morning passengers out of Miami. **********But most of all it was Mr. Acker's ''Sweet and Simple'' low-cost, unrestricted fares that made Air Florida competitive on some routes with Eastern and Pan Am. Planes were run profitably not only by keeping them nearly 100 percent full, but by scheduling aircraft that normally remained idle on weekends and holidays to run charters to Europe and the Caribbean. **********''We are all going to miss Ed Acker,'' said Robin Cohn, director of communications for Air Florida, which grew twentyfold under Mr.  Acker's direction. ''But to tell you the truth we are so busy around here no one has even had much time to talk about it.'' **********Mr. Acker took his colleagues and the airline industry by surprise, as much for signing on with Pan Am as by the way he announced it. He announced his acceptance of the post on Wednesday while addressing a group of Wall Street airline analysts gathered to hear about the future of Air Florida. He had been approached by an executive recruiter to replace William T. Seawell in the Pan Am top position. **********The shock having been absorbed, one of his first moves after signing on with Pan Am was to change his first-class reservation for the flight back to Miami from Eastern to Pan Am, ''in order to start meeting the people and sampling the service.'' He always flies first class because ''it's free'' and he because he cannott fit his 6-foot 4-inch frame comfortably into the seat-packed tourist cabin of his own airline. **********His second move was to order up a list of every nonproductive asset owned by Pan Am, a list of all the fees it has paid to its consultants and lawyers, and a description of all major jobs in the company. That, he said, is only ''5 percent'' of what he wants to know about Pan Am. **********Separated from his wife, Mr. Acker said he will use his Westport, Conn., vacation home as base for himself, two grown sons and a daughter, while he looks for something closer to Pan Am's Manhattan offices. He is also looking for a local court to exercise his passion for frontennis - an unusual game resembling racquetball that is played by four people in a three-walled court. **********''I picked it up down in Mexico,'' he said.

I love the competition.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/28/business/gte-offers-medical-system.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.T.E.

Mr. Average American, it seems, is hard-pressed to know what it is that Transamerica does. In the investment community, as one Wall Street analyst put it, ''There are only a handful of people who can even spell Transamerica.'' Ask someone what Transamerica is - all $4.4 billion of it - and you draw long hard stares. **********So one of the conglomerate's chief ambitions is to mold Transamerica into an instantly recognizable name, like General Motors or General Electric. And the man charged with tackling that task is James Harvey, who took over in January as Transamerica's chief executive officer, replacing John Beckett, the company's long-time guiding father who has retired from the post, while continuing as chairman for another two years. **********''Our goal is to build one of the great consumer names in the country, like General Electric,'' Mr. Harvey said. ''In the past the company simply hasn't been that well recognized.'' **********Out of an office high up in a striking 853-foot, pyramid-shaped building that ranks as the tallest structure in San Francisco, the 46-year-old Transamerica chief executive oversees an empire that embraces a group of insurance companies led by Occidental Insurance, a trailer and container transportation concern called Transamerica Interway, a machinery manufacturer, Budget Rent a Car, Transamerica Airlines (a charter airline that boasts that it flies to more airports than any other carrier), and United Artists, the film company that brought unenvied renown to itself (and to Transamerica) for its ''Heaven's Gate'' debacle and the resignation two weeks ago of Andy Albeck, its chief executive officer. **********Transamerica has endured a somewhat schizophrenic history. The company was started in 1928 by A.P. Giannini, the founder of the Bank of America, whose core philosophy was to serve the ''little fellows.'' Originally, Transamerica's purpose was to hold stock in Mr. Giannini's banking and nonbanking activities. **********In 1956, however, Congress essentially barred any company from owning controlling interests in both banking and nonbanking endeavors. As a result, the banking entities were spun off and Transamerica was left primarily with Occidental and a few other insurance companies. Starting in the 1960's, Transamerica began to diversify until it assumed its current huge form, and came slap up against its lack of image. **********''Part of the problem is that the name Transamerica doesn't carry over to all the companies,'' Mr. Harvey said. Hence, the appellations of four of them were modified over the last two years to include the parent's name - Transamerica Financial, for example, and Transamerica Interway. Others, most notably the big Occidental Insurance Company, which chips in more than a third of the conglomerate's revenues, are to be tinkered with in the near future. Omitted from the strategy is Budget, since Transamerica feels that the rental agency's name is well fixed in the public mind. In pursuit of implanting the Transamerica name on the tips of the public's tongue, Mr. Harvey reckons that the company has expended some $5 million in the last few years on paperwork and new signs and stationery. For instance, 500 offices of the Transamerica Financial subsidiary required new signs.  Transamerica has also standardized the colors for all of its subsidiaries to red, blue and beige. **********T HE conglomerate hopes to reap considerable recognition mileage out of the change of the Interway Company to Transamerica Interway. All new Interway containers are being painted with the revised name and old ones are repainted when hauled in for repair. About half the containers have been modified, and it's expected that in a few more years the entire fleet will bear the new name. **********''We expect a big impact from all those containers shooting up and down the highways with Transamerica painted on them,'' a Transamerica official says. **********Besides trumpeting its name far and wide, Transamerica is also scouting for ways to spend an enormous accumulation of cash over the next five years. It expects to generate excess cash on the order of $500 million to $1 billion in that five-year stretch, and it doesn't plan to just stuff it in the corporate mattress. **********''The existing companies are all well-positioned in their industries and are all profitable,'' said Frank Herringer, the senior vice president for corporate development and strategic planning, a new position at Transamerica. **********''The problem is, as I see it, that the companies are generally mature,'' he added. ''They're growing, but not extraordinarily rapidly, except for Interway. As a result, they are throwing off cash and not using it. That's okay if you have a couple of companies like that and a few cash-users. But we don't have the cash-users. So, over the next few years we'll be developing a lot of cash and the challenge that faces us is how to use that cash.'' **********Further acquisition is the most likely answer. At the moment, Transamerica is leery of straying into unrelated areas. It would like to buy another property and casualty insurance company. It would like to expand in the manufacturing of precision-engineered products. And it would like to build on United Artists, which has remained essentially a motion picture company while its competitors have been branching out. **********The kind of things United's rivals have been getting into include cable television and the sundry other new video technologies. But price is a problem there. ''We've been shown a number of cable companies and come to what should be a proper price for us to pay, or to even stretch to pay,'' Mr. Herringer said, ''and someone else comes along and pays 75 percent more.'' **********United Artists has been one of the Transamerica's more nettlesome offspring. Rumors abounded last year that the corporate parent had put it on the block. ''All a bunch of baloney,'' Mr. Harvey said.  Many Wall Street observers think that, regardless of its sentiments last year, Transamerica ought to unload the film company now. **********But Mr. Harvey professes to be firm about sticking with it. In December, he shuffled the management about, moving Andy Albeck, the president and chief executive, to chairman and chief executive, and naming Norman Auerbach as the president and chief operating officer.  Mr. Auerbach assumed Mr. Albeck's post after the latter's recent departure. Other executive shuffling has transpired, and still more is rumored to be in the works. Mr. Harvey has also insisted on tighter control of film costs. **********Recent troubles at United Artists date back to January 1978, when the five principal officers stomped out as a result of disgruntlement with Transamerica management. They founded a new company called Orion Pictures, which has steadily lured away much of United Artists' top talent. The most recent defection of note was Woody Allen. **********Mr. Harvey, however, plays down the impact of these developments, and even is sanguine about the prospects for ''Heaven's Gate'' when it is reincarnated as a two-hour film in April. ''Heaven's Gate,'' of course, is Michael Cimino's epic $36 million Western that was yanked from theaters last November after receiving caustic reviews. **********What does Mr. Harvey think about the reams of publicity generated by the movie? ''I hope it will be helpful for 'Heaven's Gate' when the edited version comes out,'' he said. **********Transamerica also believes it would make sense for it to explore buying a hotel chain, which would fit in with its Budget and Transamerica Airlines busi nesses. ''The question there is what is the long-term trend for the travel industry,'' says Mr. Herringer.  ''The big unknown is communications. What is the electronic communications industry going to do to the travel business in 1995?'' **********Budget and Transamerica Airlines executives may offer a glimpse of what that impact would be. They confer on a quarterly basis for planning purposes, at either the airline's headquarters in Oakland or at Budget quarters in Chicago. For the latest meeting, however, the companies opted to hold a teleconference meeting over the phone lines. And they loved it. **********Transamerica is not barren of additional short-term woes. ''What you've got is a lot of nicely-run subsidiaries but if you're going to be in the wrong businesses for 1981 they're in it,'' said Joseph Dowling, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert. ''This is a company that has really been hit by the interest-rate problem, and I think they've done well not to be hurt further. They are a financial services company that is probably more exposed than any other financial services company. There's almost no good news for them until the economy improves.'' **********Last year, Transamerica reported a mild increase in earnings, to $245 million from $240.2 million. Revenues grew to $4.4 billion from $4 billion. United Artists suffered a decline, much of it due to a write-off of ''Heaven's Gate'' costs. Interway also suffered mightily from the recession, though it is viewed as a highly promising growth area for the future. For 1981, analysts are anticipating fairly flat results again for Transamerica. Mr. Harvey forecasts a moderate earnings gain. **********LONG-TERM prospects, however, appear quite advantageous.  Transamerica thinks that general population trends bode very much in the favor of a service company. During the 1980's, it points out, the postwar baby boom generation will fall within the 25-to-40-year-old age bracket, which represents big earning and big spending years for most individuals. At the same time, people are living longer and retiring earlier. They, too, will require a heavy supply of entertainment and financial services. **********As for the changing of Transamerica's guard, Mr. Beckett seems happy. ''I've felt very strongly for many years that 20 years in the saddle is long enough for anyone, and maybe too long,'' he said.  ''The new broom sweeps clean.'' He expects to spend less time in the office, and to ''write music, paint a little, play tennis and spend more time with my wife.'' He also will teach an effective management course at the graduate school of business at San Francisco State starting in September. **********Not all company watchers, however, are convinced that Mr. Beckett will switch from a brooding presence to an interested observer who will leave Mr. Harvey alone. ''That's not the way Jack is,'' says Mr. Dowling of Drexel Burnham. ''He's an activist. He built this company from scratch. It's like a mother-in-law: 'You may have married my son, but I don't like the way you treated him.' It's like other top management changes. You get the title now and three years later you get the job.'' **********Mr. Dowling, among others, foresees some differences between the two executives: ''In style, Harvey will probably be more of a private person than Beckett. In content, Beckett tried to stay in financial services, and I think Harvey might stray afield.'' **********One disappointment is that the company has still roused no more than a lackluster response from the Wall Street investment community. ''They're convinced that they run a better show than most of the other financial services companies, but Wall Street has not been reflecting it,'' said John E. O'Neil, an analyst at A.G. Becker. **********''I've worked my heart out for this company,'' Mr. Beckett said.''From a financial record, we have one of the great records. We increased earnings per share in 20 years by 1,400 percent. We've increased the dividend for 19 straight years. Of course, what I feel badly about is that while we've increased earnings per share by 1,400 percent in 20 years our price per share has gone up a little over two times. I only wish I could still be in the saddle while the sales ratio improves. I hope Jim will be able to do a better job of getting to the investors.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/22/world/42-political-figures-held-in-coup-are-reportedly-freed-by-liberia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "42 Political Figures Held in Coup Are Reportedly Freed by Liberia", "print_headline": "42 Political Figures Held in Coup Are Reportedly Freed by Liberia", "body_text": " **********Liberia's military Government has released 42 prominent political prisoners seized in a coup led by the army last April, the Nigerian news agency reported yesterday. **********But the fate of Benedict Tolbert, the son of the slain President, William R.

''You can't be out there with the highest fare against a major carrier,'' Mr. Effman said in an interview in his 42d-floor ofice in a New York skyscraper. T.W.A. immediately decided to match Eastern's price. **********Mr. Effman observed that deregulation, which lets airlines cut fares and shift routes quickly, has changed his job radically and has increased the uncertainties.

Revolutionaries smashed windows at the Teheran Intercontinental while the Shah's regime was being overthrown. Sheiks have been sauntering through the Riyadh Intercontinental since well before the 1970's oil boom. **********History and revenues have been flowing copiously through the farflung portals of the Intercontinental Hotels Corporation, which is the most profitable subsidiary of ailing Pan American World Airways.  It logged pretax earnings of $23.8 million on operating revenues of $136.7 million for this year's first half. **********A Pan Am spokesman, James A. Arey, said yesterday that negotiations were continuing between Pan Am and an unnamed suitor that has made an offer for Intercontinental, which runs 83 hotels in 48 countries and has more than tripled earnings between 1976 and 1980. He said Pan Am's board would soon meet to discuss the deal. **********At both Pan Am and Intercontinental, executives declined to comment on Wall Street analysts' estimates of the subsidiary's worth - ranging from $250 million to $500 million - and on reports that the offer for Intercontinental was from an expansion-prone British company, Grand Metropolitan Ltd., and that previous bidders included a corporation in Abu Dhabi. **********Intercontinental's performance in recent years and its position in the industry have drawn praise from analysts. ''In the past 10 or 12 years, competition has increased, but Intercontinental has done well in the face of it,'' said Daniel R. Lee, leisure industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert, who was formerly with Hilton International. ''They run good hotels, though their hotels are are probably a little older than the Hilton Internationals, in general.'' **********Louis A. Marckesano, senior analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, said Intercontinental ''has been a nice source of earnings, but up until the last few years, it wasn't as profitable as some of the international chains, such as Hilton International,'' mainly ''because many Intercontinentals were in isolated regions.'' He said, however, that in recent years, Intercontinental's expansion ''has been not so much in underdeveloped areas,'' a strategy he considers positive. **********Nonetheless, Intercontinental produced less income last year and had a lower overall room-occupancy rate than its rival Hilton International, which is owned by the Trans World Corporation, parent company also of Trans World Airlines. Operates 30,400 Rooms **********Service World International, a hotel industry publication, calculated late last year that Intercontinental's total number of hotel rooms operated - the current figure is 30,400 - put it in 15th place among hotel companies with operations in more than one country. First place was held by Holiday Inns, with 303,578 rooms, and one of Intercontinental's chief rivals, Hilton International, was in 16th place with 29,485. **********A network was what Juan Trippe, then Pan Am's president, had in mind when Intercontinental Hotels was formed as a wholly owned Pan Am subsidiary in 1946. Mr. Trippe had been urged by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, according Intercontinental, to help promote tourism and trade to Latin America. Began in Brazil **********The organization began with a hostelry in Belem, Brazil, and grew to 14 hotels within a decade. In 1961, long before the Middle East oil boom of the 1970's, Intercontinental opened its first Middle East hotel - in Beirut - and it now operates nine in that region, with four more being built. **********In the 1960's, Intercontinental moved into Eastern Europe, beginning with a franchise hotel operation in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and starting new operations in the Far East, Australia, Africa and elsewhere in Europe. **********During the 1970's, while Pan Am's fortunes fluctuated, Intercontinental expanded, including the 1972 founding of its Forum Hotels division to provide relatively inexpensive lodgings. Forum has five hostelries in operation and plans others. **********In addition, Intercontinental has been mapping expansion in the United States, where it already operates four hotels: New York's Barclay, San Francisco's Mark Hopkins and others in San Antonio and Hawaii. Others are others being built in Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Houston and New Orleans, and future growth is planned for Dallas, Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago and Washington, D.C. **********Intercontinental's $41.6 million in pretax income on 1980 operating revenues of $273.5 million were 23.6 percent better than 1979's pretax earnings of $33.7 million on operating revenues of $259.8 million. **********By contrast, Hilton International in 1980 had pretax income of $65.8 million on total revenues of $628.3 million, up 18.7 percent from $55.5 million on 1979 revenues of $556.3 million. **********Hilton had an overall occupancy rate of 73 percent in 1980 in the 79 hostelries it operated with 28,800 rooms, while Intercontinental's occupancy rate was 69.1 percent for the year. One analyst said that the disparity in performances was partly because Intercontinental still has relatively more of its operations in third world countries that are relatively prone to instability. **********Most of Intercontinental's rooms are in the 76 of its hotels that it operates under lease, management or franchise agreements, rather than owns. It is the owner of only six - the hotels in New York, San Antonio, Vienna and Paris, and in Hanover and Wiesbaden, West Germany - and has a half interest in the London Intercontinental. **********Given that structure, the eventual buyer of Intercontinental ''will be getting mostly an earnings stream,'' one Wall Street analyst said this week. **********As Pan Am's red ink proliferated -it had a net loss of $218 million, the highest in its history, on revenues of $1.968 billion during this year's first six months - there was recurrent speculation that it would sell off all or part of its hotel subsidiary. **********MidEast Report, a New York-based newsletter, reported Aug. 1 that a $450 million offer for Intercontinental Hotels had been made by the Abu Dhabi Hotel Corporation, a subsidiary of the Government-owned Abu Dhabi Investment Authority."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/21/world/beirut-threatens-to-ask-for-sanctions-on-israel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 554, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BEIRUT THREATENS TO ASK FOR SANCTIONS ON ISRAEL", "print_headline": "BEIRUT THREATENS TO ASK FOR SANCTIONS ON ISRAEL", "body_text": " **********Lebanon said today that it would seek sanctions against Israel unless the Israelis agree to halt their attacks. **********Ghassan Tueni, Beirut's chief delegate here, said at a news conference that he would ask the Security Council to ''condemn Israeli aggression'' and ''resort to sanctions'' if Israel continues its attacks by air, sea and land. **********Mr. Tueni did not specify the precise nature of the sanctions he might seek. The United Nations Charter provides for imposing embargoes on the shipment of commercial and military products to nations threatening peace. **********In private, Arab diplomats said they expected Lebanon to wait until noon tomorrow before pressing the Council to act. A key factor is believed to be the mission of Philip C. Habib, President Reagan's special envoy to the Middle East. He is attempting to gain Prime Minister Menachem Begin's assent to a cease-fire. Diplomats in all camps here believe that reports of Mr. Begin flatly turning down Mr.  Habib are too categorical. Arafat Meets U.N.

Mr.  Arafat met in Beirut today with Lieut. Gen. William Callaghan, the Irish commander of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon. The P.L.O. chief is understood to have said, in effect, that his forces will stop firing if Israel will. **********If Mr. Habib fails to arrange a cease-fire, the United States will confront a difficult set of political choices in the Council. It could veto a cease-fire resolution linked to sanctions, but that would upset America's key friends in the Arab world - Egypt and Saudi Arabia. **********If Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the American delegate, votes in favor of the resolution, she will anger Mr. Begin's Government and its supporters in the United States. Until recently, American support for sanctions against Israel was considered inconceivable. But a resolution carefully drafted to rebuke violence by all sides and to suggest the possibility of punishment for failure to abide by a cease-fire at a future date might gain American assent. American support would be even more likely if it appeared that Britain and France might back such a document, isolating the United States. **********American diplomats made no secret of their uneasiness over this problem, placing an even greater premium on Mr. Habib's mission.

Asked if he believed that the Reagan Administration had secretly encouraged Israel to bomb Beirut and other points in Lebanon, the Lebanese delegate said, ''I have heard that accusation but I doubt it.'' **********Mr. Tueni said Lebanon had no interest in resolutions or speeches but wanted action from the United Nations. He said he had suggested to the Council President, Ide Oumarou of Niger, that a resolution on the issue should have four elements: an immediate cease-fire with a mechanism to carry it out; condemnation of ''Israeli aggression and its policy of pre-emptive strikes''; a provision for '' sanctions contingent on non-compliance,'' and a report by Secretary General Kurt Waldheim on implementation of the resolution."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/15/business/hamburger-hamlets-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-29.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HAMBURGER HAMLETS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 29", "print_headline": "HAMBURGER HAMLETS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 29", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/23/business/ltv-to-install-2-strand-caster.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 216, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LTV TO INSTALL 2-STRAND CASTER", "print_headline": "LTV TO INSTALL 2-STRAND CASTER", "body_text": " **********The LTV Corporation said that it would install a $165 million continuous caster at its Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation Indiana Harbor Works in East Chicago, Ind.

It concluded that placing neutron warheads on missiles and artillery shells ''would have only slight impact on the course of ongoing arms control negotiations, efforts to stem nuclear proliferation, deterrence and stability in Europe, or the destructiveness of war should it occur.'' **********Fitting the warheads, known as enhanced-radiation weapons, to missiles and artillery shells might help deter nuclear war, the report said, but at the same time ''could increase Soviet propensities to initiate the use of nuclear weapons if they have decided to go to war.'' Carter Deferred Weapon in 1978 **********In 1978 President Jimmy Carter decided to defer the neutron warhead amid controversy in Western Europe. Recently, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger renewed the neutron debate when he said he favored deploying the warhead to restore ''some kind of balance'' along the North Atlantic Treaty Organization front. **********The report made public today said that the prospects of a United States decision to deploy neutron weapons had been incorrectly perceived by many as representing a change in doctrine that would make use of nuclear weapons more likely in a limited war. But it added that modernization of nuclear weapons deployed for a war in Europe and improvements in conventional weapons could diminish the risk of nuclear war by providing a more credible deterrent. **********The report said that the use of neutron warheads, instead of regular nuclear weapons, would be no less likely to provoke a Soviet retaliation with nuclear battlefield weapons, leading to the very damage that neutron weapons were meant to avoid. Chemical Warfare Problems **********The report said an American program to upgrade military protection against chemical warfare risked possible misunderstanding because such protection was needed for both defense and attack. But it said better protection for United States forces should have a positive, though modest, arms-control effect by lessening an enemy's incentive to use chemical weapons. **********By maintaining its own stockpile of chemical weapons, the report said, the United States contributed to a climate for negotiating a ban on them. But it said that full compliance with a ban on producing, stockpiling, acquiring and retaining chemical warfare agents and munitions, as sought by the United States, could take at least 10 years. **********Soviet efforts in research and development of chemical weapons, training and operational equipment have continued, the report went on. Referring to chemical warfare, it added: ''Soviet forces are the best prepared and equipped in the world to operate in a CW environment produced either by an enemy or themselves.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/19/world/helmut-schmidt-last-year-s-critic-today-s-suitor-news-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "John Vinocur", "pub_date": "1981-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1075, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Analysis", "print_headline": "HELMUT SCHMIDT: LAST YEAR'S CRITIC, TODAY'S SUITOR; News Analysis", "body_text": " **********He has said it himself: Helmut Schmidt, a source of international envy and admiration a year ago, is a politician in trouble, a man urgently in need of friends. His threat on Sunday to resign over his party's problems with the **********NATO nuclear modernization program is not only an acknowledgment of difficulties in governing but a mortgage on his future. His most vital assets - his personality and his presence - are being put up as collateral after only eight months of a four-year term. **********As a result, the West German Chancellor, leader of the United States' most important ally, will be politically hobbled when he goes to Washington on Wednesday for talks with President Reagan. **********Mr. Schmidt has become a supplicant. A year ago, it was the Carter Administration that was unsuccessfully beseeching him to react more vigorously to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Now, with detente in tatters, West Germany's economy in recession and his own Social Democrats rebelling against him, Mr. Schmidt very much needs good relations with the United States. Statement of Good Intentions **********His remarks over the weekend, denouncing anti-American and pro-Soviet trends in his party while tying his fate to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's nuclear modernization program, can be viewed as a statement of good intentions to the Reagan Administration. **********In exchange, Mr. Schmidt would apparently like the trip to seem successful and his treatment by the United States to show he is held in respect. In addition, he would like the Americans to avoid loading him down with demands, particularly about defense, while he fights for the NATO plan to bring a new generation of medium-range nuclear weapons to Western Europe. **********With the Christian Democratic opposition waiting to call in Mr.  Schmidt's mortgage and the Social Democrats in danger of losing the Free Democrats as a coalition partner, the Chancellor will need considerable energy to convince the Reagan Administration that he is still a winner. His strongest argument is that the Social Democrats can best guarantee support for the NATO decision and that he can best fight the growing faction in the party opposed to the missile program. **********Although other factors are involved, Mr. Schmidt's troubles at home are significantly related to his attitude toward the United States. Critic of Carter Policies **********In the last years of the Carter Administration, particularly when it was demanding a more combative West German attitude toward the Soviet Union after the intervention in Afghanistan, Mr. Schmidt made clear that he felt American policies were confused, unpredictable and potentially dangerous. His palpable contempt tended to legitimize anti-American attitudes within the party that he must now combat to survive. **********The effort by some Social Democrats to portray the United States as the greatest threat to detente was accelerated in the first nine months of 1980. Former Chancellor Willy Brandt made a series of speeches in which he lumped the United States and the Soviet Union together as similar mammoths, both disagreable and more or less equally responsible for the tensions in the world. The party's deputy parliamentary leader, Herbert Wehner, described Soviet military power as defensive rather than offensive in character, calling the Soviet presence in Afghanistan a ''preventive'' measure. **********Although he was keeping his distance from Washington at the time, Mr. Schmidt warned at least once about what seemed to be a distorted view of reality. But the warnings were included in the customary party discourse about detente in a way that left the Social Democratic rank and file able to interpret the Chancellor's remarks as obligatory gestures to quiet the Americans. Such an interpretation seemed reasonable because Mr. Schmidt's friends often talked last summer about creating a broad European front that would permit the Chancellor's allies in the West and the East to block Soviet-American confrontations or steer clear of them. Polish Upheaval Alters Situation **********The situation changed radically in August, when the Polish upheaval began to undermine 10 years of calm and stability in central Europe.  The Social Democrats did not do as well as they expected in the West German elections last October. Although Mr. Schmidt was returned to office, he was privately blamed for running a campaign that was too personal and insufficiently ideological. **********Critics in the party accused him of reacting too pragmatically to the new threats in Eastern Europe. Detente, for the left wing of the party, had always been the key to its hopes for making West Germany independent of the United States and NATO. However, Mr. Schmidt was talking about the necessity of matching the Soviet missile arsenal. **********The debate about the missiles during the winter filled a spiritual vacuum in the party. The recession had eliminated new plans for social change and the Polish situation had suspended hopes for progress in relations with East Germany. The emotional issue that remained was disarmament, and the frustrations of the party's left wing were easily mobilized to fight new missiles on West German soil.  Schmidt Aides Lose Party Posts **********Feeding on the psychological conditions that were created during the year of contempt for the Carter Administration, the groups opposing the missiles gained considerable strength at the roots of party and initiated a movement at the Social Democrats' national convention last year to end support for the NATO plan. The movement gained enough strength to force two Cabinet-level officials out of their seats on a party regional council two weeks ago after they supported the Chancellor's position. **********Mr. Schmidt's aim in publicly warning of his own resignation is to cut the trend short while there is enough time for the more moderate members of the party, particularly in the trade unions, to organize a counteroffensive. **********If the threat works, Mr. Schmidt may be free to attack and isolate the party's left wing, and reverse his poor standing in public opinion polls. The surveys indicate that he is held in lower esteem than Mr. Brandt was when he resigned in 1974. **********Unless there is some immediate effect, however, Mr. Schmidt may find that he moved too soon. Without some evidence of his threat working, the issue may immobilize him and lead to a loss of confidence in him by the Free Democrats."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/26/world/new-polish-military-rulers-an-old-boy-network.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Halloran", "pub_date": "1981-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 661, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW POLISH MILITARY RULERS: AN OLD-BOY NETWORK", "print_headline": "NEW POLISH MILITARY RULERS: AN OLD-BOY NETWORK", "body_text": " **********United States military analysts say that the Polish military council ruling under martial law appears to be a cohesive group of accomplished professional officers. **********The analysts, who acknowledged that they were caught unawares when the 21-man council took over, said they found the council divided into two layers. At the top were 14 senior generals, most of them also in the Communist Party leadership; at the bottom were younger proteges and men with technical expertise. **********The analysts also emphasized that the council was made up of strong nationalists. ''All of these people are first of all Poles and second of all Communists,'' one analyst said. **********The ruling officers were said to have close ties with military colleagues in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European nations.  Several have served with the high command of the Warsaw Pact, the alliance led by the Soviet Union. **********The analysts cautioned, however, that there were still many gaps in their information on the council. They suggested that such a shortcoming could hamper United States policy decisions. Colonel Is Unidentified **********The analysts said they were still unable to identify Col. Tadeusz Makarewicz, a council member whose name had not been seen before and whose post was unknown. He was listed in the second layer of the council. **********The cohesion among the top layer, according to the analysts, arises from several factors. The officers are all about the same age, born in the early 1920's, and served in World War II, either as guerrillas or with Polish units that fought alongside the Russians. **********The analysts said the group did not include officers who had served with emigre Polish forces that fought in Western units during that war. Such officers have long since been eased out or purged, they said. **********The analysts said the officers in the council seemed to have known each other for nearly 40 years. With the exception of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the head of the council, the other army officers in the council are lieutenant generals, not major generals as reported earlier. Absence of Military Discord **********Although eight other lieutenant generals were not selected for the council, the analysts said that those named included all the generals who might have expected to be chosen. That suggests, they said, an absence of military dissidents outside the council. **********The analysts said that the council appeared to be made up of welleducated men. Some of their early and intermediate military education was in Polish command and general staff schools, they said, while the highest military education took place in war colleges in the Soviet Union. **********Lieut. Gen. Czeslaw Piotrowski, the former chief of engineers and current Minister of Mining and Power, was reported to have earned a doctor of philosphy degree in military science and a master of science degree in civil engineering. **********Among the younger members, Brig. Gen. Michal Janiszewski, who appears to be head of the council's secretariat, studied at the technical university in Gdansk, the Soviet Academy of Communications and the Polish Academy of General Staff. **********Since most members of the council have studied in the Soviet Union, the analysts said, they are believed to speak Russian. That means they can communicate directly with Russian military officers and leaders - a point that may prove important in the days ahead as the Soviet Union decides whether to send its forces into Poland. **********The military analysts said they believed that the majority of the members of the council were professional soldiers who would prefer to go back to their military duties if they set Poland's economy on its feet and stabilize the political situation. **********But they also speculated that the senior military officers might succumb to the temptation to remain in power, even though that has not been the pattern in Eastern Europe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/12/business/bankruptcy-petition-is-filed-by-opm.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1981-03-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 784, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANKRUPTCY PETITION IS FILED BY O.P.M.", "print_headline": "BANKRUPTCY PETITION IS FILED BY O.P.M.", "body_text": " **********O.P.M. Leasing Services Inc., which is under investigation because of reports that it put together questionable computer leasing arrangements, filed for reorganization yesterday under the Chapter 11 provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. **********The Manhattan-based company, one of the nation's largest computer leasing companies, listed liabilities of $504 million and assets of $446 million in its petition for court protection from creditors while it reorganizes its affairs. **********The bankruptcy petition was filed before Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lefland in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. **********The United States Attorney's office in Manhattan said Tuesday that it was ''investigating allegations related to O.P.M.'' This was prompted by industry reports questioning the concern's ability to honor leases on computer equipment that involve financing from major banks and Wall Street investment houses. **********According to O.P.M.'s petition, the details of which were supplied by its law firm, Anderson, Russell, Kill & Olick, the Securities and Exchange Commission has started an investigation into O.P.M.'s dealings with the Rockwell International Corporation, an O.P.M.  customer. The investigation by the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan is proceeding along similar lines, the petition stated. **********In recent days, several lending institutions have disclosed what appear to be ''discrepancies'' between the lease equipment schedules in their files involving O.P.M. equipment and the schedules found in O.P.M. files, according to the petition. **********In explaining why it was seeking court protection, O.P.M. said that its ''financial embarrassment'' arose from a severe problem of liquidity and changing economic conditions in the industry. It cited the introduction of the International Business Machines Corporation's 303X computer and, later, the 4300 computer, which O.P.M. said created major technological changes and ''greatly reduced costs,'' and caused older equipment to fall in value. **********Because of that, the petition said, ''a large number of the debtor's user lessees exercised early termination options in their leases. As a result, the debtor is now obligated to pay substantial sums of money to the user lessees.'' **********Philip Ryan, formerly an assistant United States Attorney and a former lawyer for the General Electric Credit Corporation, has been appointed executive vice president and director of O.P.M., the petition said. Mr. Ryan was in the process of naming an auditing concern for the company, to fill a void that has existed for several years, the petition said. 'To the Extent It Can' **********O.P.M. said in its brief that its intention was ''to investigate all allegations and to discharge its obligations to all creditors to the extent it can,'' given the Chapter 11 action and its assets. **********Under Chapter 11 provisions, an insolvent company seeks to obtain court protection against suits from creditors while it continues to operate and prepares a plan for reorganization and payment of debts.  The bankruptcy judge and major creditors must approve the proposed plan. **********According to industry sources, O.P.M., which has leased computers to some of the nation's biggest corporations, offered low lease rates to customers through leases that ran as long as eight years, in contrast with industry practice basing payments on leases of three to four years to account for the rapidly changing technology that limits a computer's useful life. **********The long-term leases, signed by major companies with impeccable credit ratings, helped O.P.M. obtain financing for the computers.  However, according to the reports, O.P.M. told customers they could terminate their leases in two to three years in the event their computers became obsolete and could not be re-marketed for the full monthly leasing rate. Allegedly Lacked Insurance **********O.P.M. reportedly told these customers that it would cover any financial loss caused by the remarketing of obsolete equipment, although it allegedly lacked insurance to cover this exposure. **********O.P.M. is controlled by Mordecai Weissman, its president, and Myron Goodman, who resigned as executive vice president last week. Each owns 50 percent of Cali Trading International Ltd., which, in turn, owns O.P.M. Neither Mr. Weissman nor Mr. Goodman nor their lawyers could be reached by telephone late yesterday for comment on the bankruptcy petition. **********It is unclear whether companies that have leased computers from O.P.M. or the investors in the leasing arrangements would be forced to absorb losses that might result from O.P.M.'s inability to honor its agreements. **********The bankruptcy petition must be approved by the court before O.P.M. can gain protection from creditors.  O.P.M. was requested several years ago to end its membership in the former Computer Lessors Association, a trade group since replaced by the Computer Dealers and Lessors Association, when O.P.M. refused to provide financial information."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/22/business/cascade-natural-gas-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CASCADE NATURAL GAS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "CASCADE NATURAL GAS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/20/business/business-people-aristrar-picks-chief-executive.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 220, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARISTRAR PICKS CHIEF EXECUTIVE", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; ARISTRAR PICKS CHIEF EXECUTIVE", "body_text": " **********Robert B.

Telephone Contacts Severed **********With a communications blackout severing telephone and other contacts with friends and relatives in Poland, there was also widespread concern over loved ones and acquaintances. **********But in nearly every gathering, there was a sense that the crackdown in Poland had not been an unexpected development, coming as it had after more than a year of mounting tensions and confrontation between the Warsaw Government and the militant labor movement, whose voice of dissent has grown powerful and strident. **********Indeed, some said they thought Warsaw's action had been virtually inevitable, particularly to avert Soviet intervention, after the union's call on Saturday for a national referendum on setting up a non-Communist government. It was most direct threat yet against the regime of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. **********Chants of ''Long Live Lech Walesa,'' ''Down With Communism'' and ''Freedom for Poland'' echoed off the facades of the Polish Consulate and the Soviet Mission to the United Nations in Manhattan yesterday as hundreds of flag-waving, placard-carrying Polish-Americans staged noisy but orderly demonstrations in the afternoon. Fear Voiced for Union Leaders **********''I'm afraid for the lives of thousands of Solidarity leaders in Poland and for the fate of millions,'' said Irena Lasota, a leader of a 1968 Polish student uprising, who helped organize yesterday's protest. **********As she spoke, more than 300 people -members of the Polish-American Congress, the Confederation for Independent Poland, the Association of Polish Veterans and other groups - marched in circles and shouted angry slogans in East 37th Street, just east of Madison Avenue, outside the baroque, four-story, white-stone Polish Consulate. **********The consulate doors remained locked during the two-hour protest, but now and then heavy draperies in the windows parted and men with cameras could be seen taking pictures of the demonstrators. Later, the crowd moved uptown to the Soviet Mission on 67th Street near Lexington Avenue and continued the demonstration. **********Though the demonstrators had not obtained permits for the protests, the police made no effort to intervene, and there were no arrests or incidents, though at one point the police tore down a bedsheet sign that had been scrawled with ''Solidarnosc'' in red letters and hung over the consulate door, blocking the entryway. In Brooklyn, People Await News **********In the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, a mostly Polish neighborhood, clusters of people gathered in coffee shops and cigarette stands and huddled beside radios, waiting for news from Warsaw. **********''The people in this neighborhood are talking of little else today and they are worried,'' said the Rev. Joseph Spilski of St.  Stanislaus Kostka Roman Catholic Church, most of whose 2,500 parishioners are of Polish descent. He said he could ''see their concern on their faces at mass this morning.'' **********''We prayed for Poland this morning,'' said the Rev. John Harchula, pastor of the Polish National Catholic Church of the Resurrection. ''It was very emotional. Many members of the congregation broke down. I'm very, very sorry that it came to this. I came back from Poland three months ago and could feel that the steam kettle was about to blow.'' **********Polish-Americans in New Jersey expressed shock over the weekend's developments and a sense of frustration at being unable to aid friends and relatives in Poland. ''We're stunned,'' said the Rev.  Adam Ziolkowki of St. John Kanty Roman Catholic Church in Clifton.  ''No one wants to overreact, but there is great concern and a feeling of helplessness.'' Differing Views of Solidarity **********There were also some conflicting views of Solidarity. ''They're trying to change things for the better for the people,'' said Henry Pastuszak, proprietor of Stanley's Restaurant in Passaic, referring to the union movement. **********But Chester Grabowski of Clifton, publisher of The Post-Eagle, a weekly Polish-American newspaper, said: ''The Solidarity boys are moving a little too fast. You can't change ideology overnight. Poland has had so many years of suffering. The people should be more practical and tactful and take a little piece at a time.'' **********John Cardinal Krol, the Archbishop of Philadelphia, who is of Polish descent and has been active in many programs to aid Poland, called the declaration of martial law ''drastic action'' and ''distressing but not surprising.'' **********He said the inference could be drawn that Poland's Communist Party feared it would lose any referendum on the establishment of a new government, and he added: ''It is our fervent prayer that the influence of moderates on both sides will prevail.'' Prayers Offered in Chicago **********In Chicago, home to 600,000 Polish-Americans, a greater concentration of ethnic Poles than in any city outside Warsaw, prayers were offered in churches for an end to strife in Poland.  Community leaders spoke of widespread fears for loved ones and in taverns and cafes on the northwest side, tense conversations in Polish and halting English focused on Poland and its patriots. **********''The Polish people are in trouble,'' said Jozef Jasiak, a gift shop owner. ''They don't like Communism. My son, my wife are in Cracow.'' An organization to which Mr. Jasiak belongs sent 3,000 packages to Poland this year, containing ''90 percent food - ham, bacon, sugar, coffee, everything.'' **********At the nearby Kasztelanka Restaurant, Leopold Holweger, who left Poland in 1965 to become an American citizen, said amid sips of coffee and clouds of cigarette smoke, ''It's a bad situation -how will the people stay organized? **********''There's only one way to fight Communism, and that's revolution,'' said his friend, Zbigniew Uchanski, a jeweler from Cracow. 'For Freedom, You Have to Fight' **********Mr. Holweger reluctantly agreed. ''There has to be blood on the street,'' he said. ''For freedom, you have to fight.'' ''We don't think the Polish Army will shoot Polish workers,'' said Mr. Uchanski, ''but Russian soldiers in Polish uniforms might do it.  Every Western country must help Poland.'' **********Many Polish-Americans said the Government's martial law declaration and its moves against Solidarity had been expected. ''I'm shocked and a little horrified,'' said Aloysius Mazewski, president of both the Polish National Alliance and the Polish-American Congress. ''I am very appalled, but I was expecting that something was bound to happen.'' **********Many people wanted to call their families and friends in Poland.  But with communictions cut off, ''we can only pray,'' said one Chicago Polish-American leader, Alderman Roman Pucinski, who is also president of the Illinois Division of the Polish-American Congress. **********Roman Koperskin, an editor of the Pomost Social Political Quarterly, said the turmoil in Poland had frightened Polish-Americans. ''Many were expecting relatives from Poland to visit them for Christmas,'' he said, ''but now the communications and transportation have been cut off. They don't know what will happen.'' Pomost is the Polish-American youth organization. Intellectuals' Attitudes Vary **********There were differing views from Polish intellectuals on possible reactions to the crackdown by the Polish Government.  Stanislas Baranczak, a visiting professor at Harvard and a founder of KOR, a dissident group that predated Solidarity, called the action a tactical blunder and said: ''The Polish people can't be suppressed in this way. This will only strengthen reaction against the Government.'' **********But Czeslaw Miros, Poland's 1980 Nobel Prize winner for literature who is also at Harvard as a visiting lecturer, said: ''People have shown a lot of restraint, wisdom and maturity until now.

Large and fast-growing markets command the highest ad fees, and owners of television stations in those areas tend to see their licenses appreciate sharply in value. **********The latest report showed no change in the ranking of the top 10 markets. The New York and the Los Angeles/ Palm Springs areas both registered declines in the number of homes with television. But they nevertheless remain far and away the nation's largest television markets. Of the top 10, Dallas-Fort Worth showed the largest rise; more than 9 percent. **********There was some shifting in the second tier of leading markets.  Houston, Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Indianapolis-Lafayette, Ind., and Tampa-St. Petersburg all recorded gains. Of those, the Tampa market showed the fastest growth, as households increased more than 17 percent, pushing the area up to 13th from 18th on the national list. **********In the booming Sun Belt, two Florida metropolitan areas, West Palm Beach-Fort Pierce and Fort Myers-Naples, where the numbers swelled 35 percent and 25 percent, respectively, expanded the most rapidly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/14/business/texas-eastern-signs-pipeline-agreement.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Texas Eastern Signs Pipeline Agreement", "print_headline": "Texas Eastern Signs Pipeline Agreement", "body_text": " **********The Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation of Houston has signed a letter of intent with the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation of Houston and the Algonquin Gas Transmission Company of Boston to become a partner with them in the New England states pipeline project. **********Each company plans to become a one-third partner in construction of the proposed $600 million natural gas pipeline, which would run about 350 miles from the Canadian border near St. Stephen, New Brunswick, to Algonquin's existing facilities near Burrillville, R.I. **********The companies will share equally in agreements with Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd. for 300 million cubic feet of Canadian natural gas a day.

Mr. McCardell made his prediction as the company was announcing the completion of a $4.2 billion financial restructuring plan, which Harvester officials said was the largest in American corporate history. **********The remarks on losses underscored the company's assertion that completion of the financing agreement -after months of negotiation - was only an inital step in pulling the company back from the brink of bankruptcy. 'Volatile Environment' **********''The environment is going to be much more volatile than in the past,'' Mr. McCardell asserted, explaining that demand for the company's heavy trucks, farm machinery and construction equipment could in the coming years be as much as 30 percent below the levels that existed in the late 1970's. Harvester said that its business plan for 1982 assumes that its markets will shrink 10 percent to 15 percent from this year's depressed levels. **********In the past, the company has been severely criticized for its rosy projections and for not trimming operations in anticipation of the worst. Harvester said today that it can adjust its operations to the worst economic assumptions. **********The company has announced plans to reopen its contract with the United Automobile Workers early next year. It is asking the union for concessions of $100 million a year in the form of more liberal work rules and fewer fringe benefits. **********Mr. McCardell said that Harvester would continue to divest itself of underperforming assets, estimating that the company still had ''several hundred millions of underutilized assets.'' He denied, however, that there were plans to sell the beleaguered construction equipment business, but he implied that certain products in that division might be phased out. **********Inventories are to be cut further and the holiday shutdown of some plants may be extended into February. Harvester estimated that its plants will operate at only 33 percent of capacity in the first quarter of the fiscal year 1982, which ends on Jan. 31. **********More components will be purchased from outside the company as old high-cost production facilities are phased out. Salaries of management and clerical employees will remain frozen, a move that saved the company $45 million in the fiscal year 1981. Capital expenditures will be reduced to ''the absolute minimum,'' according to Mr. McCardell. **********Mr. McCardell dismissed suggestions that he and Warren Hayford, the president, would find it easier to win concessions from the auto workers if they gave back bonuses of $1.8 million for Mr. McCardell and $900,000 for Mr. Hayford, given them last year by the board of directors. **********''We've spent a lot of time trying to undo this - trying to figure out a way that would make it as if it never happened,'' he said.  ''But we haven't found a way that we could do it without helping me.'' **********Mr. McCardell said that his bonus -actually a loan that was given in stages - all went to buy Harvester stock. He says that because of interest payments, taxes and paper losses on the stock's decline in the market, he had suffered losses of $500,000 in the value of the bonus. To undo the agreement would wipe out his losses, he maintained. **********Harvester said several covenants had been attached to the new financial agreement, which transforms the company's $3.5 billion in short-term debt into a term loan maturing in December 1983. The plan also calls for the sale of $750 million in receivables of Harvester's financing subsidiary. **********In addition, cash interest payments will be only at the rate of 11 percent for the credit subsidiary and not more than 16 percent for the parent company. Paper, convertible to equity, will be issued for the difference between the cash interest payments and prevailing markets rates during the two-year agreement. **********Included among covenants are restrictions on the payment of dividends on common and preferred stock.

Jay Hammond, who said in a recent interview that he believed ''the gas line will be built -some day.'' **********A major financial problem is that there has not yet been any reaction to a borrowing presentation last month seeking $22.5 billion from a group of banks and insurance companies. **********Another hitch involves the three oil companies that own 95 percent of the natural gas in Prudhoe Bay: They are concerned about a Federal law that prohibits them from owning part of the gas pipeline that they are expected to help to finance. **********'Significant Amount of Gas' **********While there is growing pessimism about when the pipeline will be started, Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Alaska Republican, told members of the Fartherest North Press Club recently, ''the economics of Alaska gas are based on a very significant amount of gas for a long period of time.'' The Prudhoe gas reserves have been estimated at 26 trillion cubic feet. Total annual production in the United States is 20 trillion cubic feet. **********The Alaskan portion of the line, to be built by a consortium called the Northwest Alaskan Pipeline Company, is to follow the existing oil line south from Prudhoe Bay, then parallel the Alcan Highway southeast. Other groups are to bring the line south from the Canadian border to Edmonton, Alberta, where it will branch to a western leg ending near San Francisco and an eastern one to Chicago. **********The southern legs are to be built first, moving Canadian gas to the United States. Alaska gas would ultimately replace the Canadian supplies. **********There is not yet a firm estimate of what the gas will cost American consumers. Estimates have ranged from $10 to $15 for a thousand cubic feet. Gas currently exported by Canada costs less than $5 a thousand cubic feet. Deliveries Now Set for 1986-87 **********Planners in the companies that own the gas now talk of deliveries in 1986-87. A year ago, plans called for service to begin in 1985.  Two weeks ago Harold Moles, vice president of Northwest Alaskan Pipeline, said, ''We have not quite given up on November 1985, but 1986 looks more realistic.'' **********None of the delays that have pushed the start of construction back a year stem from the engineering concerns that afflicted the Trans Alaska Pipeline System in its planning stages a decade ago. Nothing like the TAPS line, which brings oil from Prudhoe Bay to the Alaskan port of Valdez, had ever been done. **********''Midyear will see the preliminary designs engineered and the costs well established,'' said Lieut. Gov. Terry Miller, who has been a nonvoting member of the project's design and engineering board. The state owns 12.5 percent of the gas as its royalty share. **********Engineers and survey crews working out of the gas pipeline's offices have the oil line's successful experiments to depend on as they reach crucial decision points, and can avoid TAPS' mistakes.  They are currently making extensive tests in permafrost on the line's behavior when buried in constantly frozen soil. The oil line was elevated on individually engineered supports in those areas, an immense expense. Political and Financial Problems **********The financing is one major unresolved issue.  A group of four banks and two insurance companies was asked on May 21 to set up $22.5 billion in financing, with 30 percent of the equity being provided by the oil companies that own the gas and 70 percent coming from the construction consortium. **********The banks involved were Chase Manhattan, Citicorp, Bank of America and Morgan Guaranty; the insurance companies were Prudential and Metropolitan Life. They have not yet responded to the proposal. **********Changes in Federal law that govern the pipeline are the other area of concern. Two of these are crucial, according to sources within the group that proposes to build the line. **********First, the Exxon Corporation, the Atlantic Richfield Company and the Standard Oil Company (Ohio), which own the gas at Prudhoe Bay, have balked over the prohibition against their owning part of the line they are expected to help pay to build. When the Carter Administration wrote the law authorizing the pipeline, the Department of Justice antitrust division wanted the oil companies barred from ownership. **********The consortium of 11 gas distribution firms that owns Northwest Alaskan Pipeline as a partnership has agreed to have the oil companies own 30 percent of the project. Paying for Conditioning Plant **********The oil companies are also concerned about the provision that requires them to pay for the conditioning plant that cleans up the gas before it enters the pipeline system. **********As things stand now, this plant would be considered a part of the oilfield development. The companies are insisting that the plant be considered part of the pipeline, which would allow it to be paid for in part from gas transport fees. **********This costing arrangement is crucial to the oil companies. They will not participate under the current conditions, one source said.  The banks and insurance companies were told that the cost of the line would be $21 billion, that the conditioning plant would cost $6 billion and that a precommitted sum described as a completion assurance pool of $3 billion would be set up to meet cost overruns.  The oil companies have agreed to provide equity and debt of $9 billion to cover their share. **********With a debt-equity ratio of 75/25 percent, the oil companies must provide $2.25 billion equity and $6.75 billion in debt, while the consortium provides $5.25 billion in equity and $15.75 billion of debt. **********Lieutenant Governor Miller said that ''the state is fairly pleased'' with the financial proposals. He noted that the plan did not involve state participation in construction costs and that it sought to protect wellhead value, which is where the state's royalty is calculated, by insisting on having the conditioning plant treated as part of the line, not a field development cost. **********''We hope the Federal Government will grant the law changes that are needed,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/04/business/arco-moves-to-sell-montana-property.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arco Moves to Sell Montana Property", "print_headline": "Arco Moves to Sell Montana Property", "body_text": " **********The Federal Trade Commission said that the Atlantic Richfield Company was seeking permission to divest its Heddleston, Mont., copper properties, with Asarco Inc. getting them. **********Arco would receive Asarco's noncopper mineral interests at Summitville, Colo., in exchange. **********F.T.C. approval is required under a 1979 consent order.

The new policy, he said, ''has substantially diminished,'' rather than wiped out, any influence Washington retains. **********President Carter's former Secretary of State spoke at the midtown Park Avenue offices of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett, the law firm where he is a senior partner. Mr. Vance was in Moscow 10 days ago for a conference on disarmament. He saw several Soviet leaders, including Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko. **********He said he had discussed with Mr. Gromyko the consequences of a pact to sell China weapons and the Foreign Minister had ''expressed his concern.''

Haig Jr. announced in Peking last week that the United States would for the first time offer to sell ''lethal weapons'' to China. **********Mr. Vance said this decision ''was neither sound nor well-timed.'' ''It was a very bad mistake,'' he said. ''It was needlessly provocative and smacked of bear-baiting rather than well-thought-outpolicy. It runs counter to the objective of diplomacy - influencing others in dealing with a subject you are concerned with.'' **********The former Secretary said he did not know how Moscow would respond, but he said that it would respond and in a manner the United States would not welcome. Mr. Vance was reluctant to say what effect the arrangement might have on potential Soviet moves in Poland. ''But what we say as a restraint is lessened,'' he said. **********In office, Mr. Vance said, he had used the same arguments against arming China to those urging weapons for Peking. He would not name the proponents. He Favors Aid for Pakistan **********The Administration's decision to sell arms to Pakistan also drew mixed reviews from Mr. Vance. The Carter Administration tried to arrange a similar pact after the Soviet Union intervened militarily in Afghanistan, but Pakistan's ruler, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, dismissed the offer as ''peanuts.'' **********''I was glad an agreement has been reached,'' Mr. Vance said. ''It is important that Pakistan be assisted.'' But he said the ratio of military aid, about $400 million a year, to economic assistance, about $100 million a year, was too heavily weighted on the side of arms. Mr. Vance also quarreled with the proposal to sell Pakistan sophisticated F-16 fighter-bombers that he said would be far more useful against India than against any attack by the Soviet Union. **********However, he said, ''India clearly brought this about by their decision to buy high-performance aircraft.''

He won the fight and clung to his vision that the way to beat the Communists was to strangle them with love: to maintain the notion of a united left, that is, win over the Communist voters and eventually force the Communist leaders to break with him out of sheer selfpreservation. **********It is what happened, more or less. Mr. Mitterrand is President thanks, in part, to voters who abandoned their normal tendency to vote Communist and voted for him instead. At the same time, without ever quite announcing it, Mr. Mitterrand has given more and more support to his party's center; and today, an hour after his inauguration, he named Mr. Mauroy as his Prime Minister. 'Illusion of Revolution' **********It was a move intended to signal the intention to reform France, not to revolutionize it. ''To change society it is necessary to turn our back on the illusion of revolution,'' Mr. Mauroy told the dogmatists in Metz. **********Pierre Mauroy - the name is pronounced Mawr-WAH - is a big, generous-mannered man who radiates an air of bonhomie and tolerance that is not the normal demeanor of a French politician, whether of the left or right. Some have called him ''our German Socialist,'' and in many ways he has more in common with the pragmatic ways of a Helmut Schmidt than with the fitful Jacobin conscience of the French party. **********Mr. Mauroy is more professional politician than ideologue; his enthusiasms for the accommodation and gritty practice of politics, if they made him an antagonist to the left wing of his party, have made him suspect lately to the supporters of Mr. Rocard. Still, they get along with him - everyone seems to - and it is no bad quality in a politician to be just a little bit distrusted all around, so long as it is done equitably and in good humor. **********Mr. Mauroy, who is 52, has his fief in France's industrial and depressed northeast. He has been Mayor of Lille, as well as a deputy in the National Assembly, since 1973. The northeast is a closely fought battleground between the Socialists and the Communists. Mr.  Mauroy fought hard, did well and has good credentials to argue with those in the center and the right of the French spectrum who contend that the Socialists, once in power, will let the Communists lead them around by the nose. Helped Rebuild Socialist Party **********Mr. Mauroy, who is married and has a grown son, is the son of a schoolteacher and the grandson of a woodcutter. The oldest of seven children, he became a professor at a technical school and joined the Socialist Party. He caught the attention of Guy Mollet, then the head of the party, and went to work as his deputy. **********When the Socialist Party went into deep decline in the 1960's, at one point winning only 5 percent of the vote, Mr. Mauroy teamed up with Mr. Mitterrand to begin the long process of rebuilding the party. At the same time he established himself as the head of the Socialist federation of the northeast. **********A man with a taste for concrete things, he worked hard for his region; among other things, he succeeded in getting a local train service established. He needed help from the national Government and managed to get it from President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, despite their opposite political alignments. Of all the leading Socialists, in fact, he was the one with whom Mr. Giscard d'Estaing got along best. **********Mr. Mauroy's energy, affability and reputation as a moderate are qualities that Mr. Mitterrand clearly intends to draw on in the coming months."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/07/business/argentine-gas-find.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Argentine Gas Find", "print_headline": "Argentine Gas Find", "body_text": " **********A company formed by concerns from West Germany, France and Argentina said it had discovered an offshore hydrocarbons deposit off the southern tip of Argentina.

The reduction reflected a sharp decline in what banks must pay for their own funds,giving them leeway for further reductions in the interest rates they charge their customers. **********Interest rates also declined in the credit markets yesterday for both long-term and short-term issues as the financial markets debated whether the Federal Reserve had eased monetary policy. (Page D12.) **********Many bankers were guardedly optimistic that interest rates would continue to decline. But after having guessed wrong often during the past year of high interest rates, they were reluctant to make any firm predictions. **********''The markets have been so volatile, it would be foolhardy to say unequivocally that this is it,'' said Irwin L. Kellner, senior vice president and chief economist of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''But I'm hopeful, and I'm forecasting that the decline has begun.'' **********''Obviously, we would like to think this is the beginning of a decline in interest rates, but it could be wishful thinking,'' said Edward L. Palmer, chairman of the executive committee of Citibank, which was the first to announce the reduction in the rate. **********''We see the next movement continuing to be down,'' said Frank V.  Cahouet, vice chairman of the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. ''But the speed of the decline will depend upon a lot of things, including further budget cuts, Wall Street attitudes and Federal Reserve policy.'' Cost of Funds Drops **********Yesterday's drop in the prime was the first widespread reduction in that key lending rate since May 20, when it also dropped to 20 percent from 20 1/2 percent. The May decline, however, turned out to be a false start, and the next movement, on July 2, was a return to the 20 1/2 percent level. **********The move back to the 20 percent level was initiated on Aug. 31 by the Chase Manhattan Bank. Three other major banks followed Chase's lead over the last two weeks, and the re st of the nation's major banks acted y esterday. **********The decline in the prime was attributed to a sharp drop in the rates banks must pay for their own funds. Only a week ago, banks were paying about 18 percent for large, six-month certificates of deposit that are issued in denominations of $1 million or more. By yesterday, that rate had declined to around 16 3/4 percent. **********Interest rates that banks must pay for Federal funds, overnight money that banks trade among themselves, have also declined sharply.  The Federal funds rate ranged from 15 5/8 percent to 15 3/4 percent yesterday, down a full percentage point from the level of a week earlier and down from the 18 percent level that prevailed until the third week of August. **********Mr. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover said yesterday that, by itself, the decline in these costs would justify a prime rate as low as 19 or 19 1/2 percent. But, he said, aside from the short-term profits that might be earned by keeping the prime above that level, the banks feared that lower rates would encourage more borrowing by businesses and that this would eventually drive rates still higher. **********Heavy demand for credit is one of the reasons that some bankers and economists are pessimistic that rates will decline much further, if at all. **********''In view of the demand for credit, which is moving along at a very brisk pace, I think it is likely we'll see a rise in the money supply, which will cause the Federal Reserve to tighten credit again,'' said Jay N. Woodworth, vice president and economist of the Bankers Trust Company. Heavy Borrowing Feared **********Mr. Woodworth also expressed fear that heavy borrowing by the Treasury in the last quarter of 1981 and the first quarter of 1982 will exert upward pressure on interest rates. He estimated that Treasury demands in these two quarters will be close to the $66 billion it borrowed in the comparable 1980-81 period. During that period, the prime reached a record 21 1/2 percent. **********By contrast, last year the prime dropped quickly from 20 percent in early April to 10 3/4 percent in late July.

Page D1. in Gdansk rose to denounce the compromise, some in stinging terms.  ''This union was not created to make compro mises, but to smash the totalitarian system in our country,'' Jan Rul ewski, a leading militant from Bydgoszcz, said. **********'Don't Think I'm a Fool' **********The leaders argued back, saying that the agreement was not a bad one, that some delegates' speeches smacked of electioneering for union office and that what counted now, above all, was keeping Solidarity united. **********''Don't think I'm a fool,'' Lech Walesa, the union's leader, said, leaning toward the microphone and chopping the air with his right hand in combative style. **********''I have to ride the horses you've given me,'' he said, referring to the union's advisers who counseled him to accept the compromise. Union Cautioned on Politics **********Mr. Walesa also cautioned the union once again against seeking to seize political power.  ''Some ideas are to destroy the Sejm and Government, take their place and became as totalitarian as they are,'' he said. ''This we cannot do - we must protect ourselves from ourselves.'' The Sejm is Poland's Parliament. **********The compromise was embodied in legislation on workers' self-management that was passed by Parliament last week. It settled the sticky question of who appoints directors in factories and other enterprises, the workers or the state, by allowing both to propose candidates in all but strategic industries. Decision-Making Is Assailed **********At the first phase of its congress earlier this month, the delegates took the position that workers alone, through their elected councils, should have the right to make managerial appointments. They also called on Parliament to undertake a national referendum to insure that any legislation on self-management would reflect the genuine wishes of the workers. **********What upset some of the more radical chapter leaders was not just the compromise, but the way in which it was reached. Solidarity proposed the outline of the agreement to the Government after only four members of the union's ruling presidium approved it. Mr. Walesa was among the four.  Jacek Kuron, a leading dissident, was reportedly instrumental in convincing the union officials to accept the compromise. Despite the angry tone of today's speeches, which took a more personal turn than any during the session two weeks ago, union leaders and strategists were confidently predicting that the delegates would go along with the leadership and not repudiate the legislation. **********Even some of the critics seemed to accept this, arguing that they had been presented with an accomplished fact. Only half a dozen, including Mr. Rulewski, advocated trying to overturn the new law. **********''We have lost the battle but not the war,'' Maciej Sewerynski, a delegate from Warsaw, said. ''We've got to fight to change the law.'' It seemed likely that the leadership could heal the division over the issue without opening a major split in Solidarity, although the fracas could well help to erode some of the mystique of unchallenged authority that still surrounds Mr. Walesa. **********In March. Mr. Walesa and a small circle of other leaders called off a national strike. The move, criticized at the time as ''undemocratic,'' was recalled bitterly today by more than one delegate. **********With 49 speakers scheduled to talk and the debate taking up the entire second day of the second phase of the convention, it was shaping up as something of a test of Mr. Walesa's self-assertive style of leadership. But no one doubts that he will be re-elected by an overwhelming vote later in the session. Few Leaders Attack New Law **********One rea son that an open split seems unlikely is that very few of the leaders w ith national stature, except for Mr. Rulewski, took a strong stand against accepting the new law. Some who might have done so, such as A ndrzej Gwiazda of Gdansk or Karol Modzelewski of Wroclaw, supp orted the compromise but more in sorrow than in pleasure. **********Mr. Gwiazda said it was a ''deplorable political mistake'' for such an important decision to be taken by such a small group, but he did not attack the law itself. The leadership, he suggested, is rapidly losing touch with the grass roots. **********''I think our leaders use a different kind of language now,'' he said, ''It' s a language understood by the authorities, but not by the rank and file. There are no longer talking to the grass roots.'' **********Mr. Gwiazda, a member of the union's presidium, was out of town when the decision to offer the compromise was taken. In addition to Mr. Walesa, the only presidium members present were Mr. Rulewski, who voted against the compromis e, and Leszek Wado lowski and Andrzej Jedynak, who joined Mr. Walesa in supporting it. Fears of a Split in Union **********Mr. Modzelewski's speech concentrated on fears that the union might split over the issue and was losing its capacity to mount an effective protest. ''The conflict must not come into the union itself - this is what the authorities are counting on,'' he said. **********''We are in a political situation now,'' Mr. Modzelewski said. ''Do we have the driving force to fight for changes in the law? I believe we don't have it. For many members the credibility of the union has gone down.'' **********Mr. Walesa defended himself vigorously with the personal revelations that mark his speaking style. He was sick the day of the meeting, but he managed to get there, he said.

But pay-by-phone, as it is sometimes known, has failed to live up to expectations. **********''We expected a lot more growth, but it did not materialize,'' said Paul R. Messing, a vice president of the Greater New York Bank for Savings, which pioneered the service in the New York City area. **********''It has not caught fire,'' agreed Stephen Iovino, vice president in charge of electronic banking for the Chase Manhattan Bank, which also offers the service. **********The major reason, according to Mr. Iovino, is the difficulty that most people have in adjusting to a new form of banking and their fear of losing their financial privacy. ''The uninitiated customer perceives some loss of control,'' he said. ''But it is still the customer, not the bank, who has the responsibility for allocating resources. The bank, in effect, acts like a secretary.'' **********Altho ugh it may seem intimidating, the mech anics of telephone bill payment are simple. Customers dial a special bank telephone number, give their bank account number, their persona l identification number, the numerical code of the merchant an d the amount they wish to pay. **********Usually, consumers give this information to live bank operators who remain on duty long past normal banking hours. The information is then fed into the central bank computer, where the orders are pro cessed. In cases where the banks are fully automated and the customers hav e push-button phones that can ''talk'' directly to the bank computer , there is no human contact at all. **********Most banks have fairly extensive, but fixed, lists of merchants they will pay, including department stores, utilities, other banks, real estate companies and hospitals. But they will usually not make payments to individually owned busineses, such as medical and dental practices or landlords of single-family houses, or to merchants outside the immediate area. One attractive feature that is generally available permits banks to automatically pay regularly recurring bills, such as payments on mortgage or installment loans, without prompting by the customer each month. **********Pay-by-phone eliminates checks, stamps and envelopes. Consumers get no immediate paper receipt of the transaction, but instead receive monthly statements describing all the bills paid by telephone. For tax purposes, the statements, which list the names of the merchants and the amounts they were paid, are equivalent to canceled checks. **********Banks benefit from this arrangement because it reduces their timeconsuming and expensive paperwork costs. Instead of having to process many small individual payments to a given merchant, a bank can combine all the payments into one giant check. If the merchant is large enough, or if the merchant is also a customer of the bank, the funds are transferred electronically. **********More than 100 banks across the country offer the service, but it is available only at Chase and Greater New York in New York City.  Several Connecticut banks, including the Peoples Savings Bank and the Union Trust Company, offer the service. In New Jersey, it is available from the Howard Savings Bank in Newark. **********Although they expect that the advent of the 20-cent postage stamp will bring in some new business from consumers who believe they can save money by avoiding the mail when paying bills, bankers who offer the service are not predicting a major turnaround that would put the service into the black. **********''If you called 100 bankers, unless one of them was a liar, every one would tell you it's a money loser,'' said Ronald McCulloch, vice president for corporate planning at Union Trust, which has offered the service for several years. **********''In fact, I'm a little concerned about the 20-cent stamp,'' he added, noting that the more of this business the bank gets, the more money it loses. The major reason, he said, is the high cost in tracking payments made to merchants. ''They often say they didn't get a payment, so we must check and check and check. Usually they've misplaced the check, but it happens frequently enough to tie up one person full time.'' **********Despite the disappointing experience with pay-by-phone, major banks have not been discouraged from testing the waters for the next chapter in the saga of electronic banking - home video banking. The Bank of America, Citibank and Chase all have, or are planning, pilot projects to gauge customer reaction to services that let people perform banking transactions through computers and television sets in their homes. **********Meanwhile, for consumers who are not afraid of change, paying bills by telephone is probably a good deal. Costs of the service have not risen much in the last few years, and are certainly cheaper than using the mail for people who write many checks. **********At Chase, for example, the service is free for people who maintain an extra $1,500 in their accounts over and above the bank's standard minimum balance; otherwise it costs $1.50 a month. Greater New York charges 10 cents per telephone call, but allows people to pay as many bills as they wish on that one call. **********Without exception, bankers say that the vast majority of people who try the service become devoted converts. ''If we were ever to tell our customers that we were discontinuing it, I think they'd leave the bank,'' said Mr. Messing of Greater New York. ''It's the greatest thing in the world, if people would just try it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/12/business/burgess-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BURGESS INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "BURGESS INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/07/business/continental-airlines-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 28, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONTINENTAL AIRLINES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "CONTINENTAL AIRLINES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/06/world/latin-policy-a-new-plan-news-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1981-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1297, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Analysis", "print_headline": "LATIN POLICY: A NEW PLAN; News Analysis", "body_text": " **********After months of often contradictory signals, Reagan Administration officials say they have settled on a four-part approach to dealing with what they see as the problems of Cuban and Soviet intervention in Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America. **********They say they hope this tentative plan, which they say they will refine in coming weeks, will involve other Latin nations and reduce the necessity of a single-handed American military role. **********The general outline of the approach was made public Friday in Castries, St. Lucia, to the Organization of American States by Secretary of State Alexander M.

The aim is to put an end to the seeming indecision that has marked the Administration's policy for most of the year. **********The four-point approach that is being worked on is described in this manner by Mr. Haig and others: The Administration hopes to keep open lines of communication with Nicaragua in the hope that the country's Sandinist leadership can be persuaded that its support for the guerrillas in El Salvador should stop and that its interests do not lie in throwing itself completely into the Cuban and Soviet camps. **********There is not much optimism within the State Department that the Sandinists, who see themselves as liberators in the area, will be turned from their course. Nevertheless, in deference to Mexico and other countries that still see some hope in Nicaragua, Washington will keep the door open. **********Mr. Haig is also in regular contact with Moscow. As to contacts with Cuba, the State Department would not comment on a report in a Madrid newspaper that Mr. Haig, while in Mexico 10 days ago, met with a high-ranking Cuban official. Collective Approach Sought **********Meanwhile, taking advantage of widespread concern in the hemisphere about what are seen as renewed Cuban subversive tactics, particularly in the militarization of Nicaragua, the Administration hopes to formulate some kind of collective approach to deal with the situation. **********There is no expectation of an initiative by the Organization of American States as such, but rather the bringing together of those nations most willing to act in unison to formulate common positions.  Mr. Haig talked about preventing the importing of heavy offensive weapons, such as Soviet-built fighter aircraft, into Nicaragua and the limiting of foreign military advisers. **********One possibility would be military cooperation between El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala, the countries perceived to be most threatened by Nicaragua, with aid and advice provided by the United States, Argentina and other major powers. More Aid Would Be Available **********While ruling out American combat involvement, the United States would make clear that it would be ready to supply increased military and economic assistance. The amounts of aid involved are small, relative to the large-scale American assistance for such areas as the Middle East. But the Administration has already doubled its military aid to Honduras, for instance, to $10 million for this fiscal year. **********Any significant increases in aid will require the full support of Congress, however, and this is questionable. So far, for example, Congress has seemed reluctant about, if not critical of, American support for El Salvador, because of that Government's seeming inability to keep its police in check. There is also strong criticism of Guatemala because of repressive policies there. **********Mr. Haig intends to make a major effort this week, before going on a trip to Europe, to persuade the House of Representatives to approve the new aid bill to make increased support in Latin America possible.  Caribbean Basin Plan Evolving **********Finally, to demonstrate that it is concerned with more than just security matters, the United States would make public a concrete plan for the Caribbean basin that has been worked on for most of the year, but which until Friday appeared to be devoid of much substance. **********Mr. Haig said President Reagan was preparing a three-part economic plan: legislation to allow Caribbean and Central American countries one-way free trade preferences into the American market; special incentives and other measures to spur private investment in private ventures in the region, and an increase in American financial aid to deal with acute liquidity crises in such countries as Costa Rica. It is not known whether Congress, in the current tight budget atmosphere, will be generous to the Caribbean countries. **********Much of the confusion surrounding American policy in the Caribbean has been caused by the seemingly erratic nature of Administration statements. **********At the start of the Administration, Mr. Haig opened a major campaign around the world to draw attention to what he said was Cuban, Vietnamese and Soviet support for the insurgents in El Salvador, who he charged were being supplied by way of Nicaragua. U.S. Involvement Opposed **********There was considerable speculation in this country that the campaign was a precursor for involvement of the Vietnam war type.  Since El Salvador's Government was regarded as having been responsible for, or at least having countenanced, the murder of four American Roman Catholic workers, as well as other assassinations, there was almost no public support for a deeper American involvement there. **********The White House, concerned earlier this year with gaining approval of the President's economic package, did not welcome a Salvador distraction and told Mr. Haig to put an end to his public campaign.  This irritated Mr. Haig, who felt that he was being muzzled; subsequently he said privately that his campaign had led Nicaragua to stop supplying arms to the Salvadoran rebels but that the flow had resumed after the United States stopped talking about the issue. **********Now he has been given permission again to make his concerns known, and he has seemed to pick up an ally in Edwin A. Meese 3d, the White House counselor, who has recently echoed Mr. Haig's words of concern. Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, however, has been wary of the campaign and has said very little about the situation. Military Moves Hinted **********As part of this increased public campaign, Mr. Haig and Mr. Meese refused in recent weeks to rule out such American military moves as a naval blockade of Nicaragua or the mining of Nicaraguan harbors. **********But the presentation by Mr. Haig in St. Lucia was meant, in part, to assure the Latins that the United States wanted to avoid playing a unilateral military role. **********''I think if we 'heavy-hand' our position there, it is wrong,'' reporters on Mr. Haig's plane were told. ''It's wrong in the sense of American policy and it is wrong also from the standpoint of hemispheric unity and collective action.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/28/business/market-place-new-options-in-mergers.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Metz", "pub_date": "1981-09-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 934, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; New Options In Mergers", "print_headline": "Market Place; New Options In Mergers", "body_text": " **********CREDITHRIFT FINANCIAL has been living with uncertainty since Orion Capital made a merger proposal backed by holdings of 9.9 percent of Credithrift's shares in the spring of 1979. **********Though Credithrift's management discouraged the plan, the Orion Capital shares, taken with shares owned by the Wickes Companies (9.8 percent) and those owned by Petra Capital (just under 5 percent) accounted for nearly a quarter of capitalization. Management, by contrast, owned less than 2 percent of the shares. **********Credithrift acted to eliminate the uncertainty earlier this month in deciding to merge with American General, a casualty insurance company that has acquired the Wickes block of shares. **********Terms of the deal were greeted with dismay by both Orion and Petra. Credithrift's common shares are to be exchanged for $11.50 stated value of an American General junior preferred, which the companies announced would have a 10 percent annual dividend rate and would be convertible into American General shares at $4 8. American General closed Friday at 39. Credithrift closed at 10 1/2. **********In an unusual feature, the preferred can be redeemed at any time for cash equal to the $11.50 stated value. From Orion's and Petra's point of view, the price is low - discouragingly close to Credithrift's book value of roughly $11.60 a share. A recent acquisition of Dial Financial, which like Credithrift is a consumer finance company, brought a price nearer twice book value. **********The next step is for Credithrift shareholders to vote on the deal.  In doing so later this year they will, in effect, be concerned about the fairness of the exchange ratio. Carl Ferenbach, managing director of merger s and acquisitions for the Merrill Lynch White Weld Capital Markets Group, represented Credithrift in the negotiations with American General. **********He confirmed last Friday that Merrill Lynch as adviser to Credithrift will be giving an opinion to the shareholders that the merger terms are fair and reasonable. **********What has drawn the attention of some followers of the merger scene is another detail in connection with the negotiation of the merger.  Credithrift management agreed to give American General an option to buy 18 percent of Credithrift's common at $11.50 a share. **********The option, referred to by some investment bankers as a ''well poisoner,'' is designed to make it difficult for any other potential suitor to make a competing bid. For American General will have locked up more than a quarter of the shares if it exercises the option.  Obviously, any suitor owning a quarter of a company before a bidding war has a formidable advantage. **********Unlike the competition, which must pay a price reflecting a heated contest for all shares acquired, the option holder averages down the higher cost of additional shares with the low cost shares he starts with. In addition, the option holder doesn't have to buy as many shares as the competition to attain a majority position. **********If the option technique works, the holder's advantage is at the expense of shareholders who could expect to receive more for their holdings in an open bidding contest. **********If a bidding contest weren't likely, why would management use the option in the first place? That's the question troubled analysts ask.  Options of this nature are still relatively new in merger and acquisition practice. The device is aimed at clinching a deal with a favored merger partner, though the price may not be the best obtainable. **********The option was first employed by strategists for Pullman and its white knight, Wheelabrator-Frye. Had the plan worked, it clearly would have foreclosed a higher bid by the McDermott Corporation which had been seeking Pullman for more than a month. **********In that case, the outside strategists had Pullman offer Wheelabrator an option to buy Pullman's prized Kellogg engineering division in the event that the white knight bid failed. **********McDermott publicly disparaged the two options and raised its bid anyway. At that point, Wheelabrator chose not to rely on either of the two novel options and met McDermott dollar for dollar in the market place, eventually topping McDermott's highest bid. **********Thus, the first time out, the option technique had no significance as a clincher. But it did bring Wheelabrator management into a game it might never have played had the final price been even dimly foreseen. **********Wheelabrator eventually paid $52.50 a share in cash and stock - over $100 million more than its initial bid. Moreover, in making its winning bid, Wheelabrator had to ante up cash for 5.5 million shares, up from the 2 million shares for cash contemplated by its initial offer. **********Since that time, scores of deals have included sweetheart options for stock, but no court in a position to rule on their legality has done so. **********It is understood that some acquiring companies have shunned these options on grounds that they may be unfair to the shareholders of the acquired company. **********Mr. Ferenbach was asked how his firm could give a fairness opinion on the American General merger terms in view of the existence of the option. **********He said: ''I don't think the option impacts on fairness. The option is something many have offered to encourage potential buyers to enter into a transaction.'' **********One lawyer active in mergers and acquisitions said that no prominent law firm he knows of has given a formal opinion that these options are legal, valid and binding under state law."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/21/world/prolonged-rain-in-france-kills-livestock-and-destroys-crops.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prolonged Rain in France Kills Livestock and Destroys Crops", "print_headline": "Prolonged Rain in France Kills Livestock and Destroys Crops", "body_text": " **********Eight days of heavy rain have caused flooding across France, killing thousands of farm animals and destroying millions of dollars worth of crops and agricultural equipment, officials said today. **********More rain was forecast for large parts of the nation Monday.

The line is expected to cost as much as $40 billion, most of which would be spent to build the 731-mile leg of the pipeline running through Alaska to the Canadian border. **********The official statement did not list the specific items in the waiver package.  But according to a spokesman for the Northwest Alaskan Pipeline Company, formed to build the pipeline, it would include a fiercely debated provision under which gas consumers would start to help pay for the line before they received any gas. **********It would also guarantee the sponsors what has come to be called ''regulatory certainty,'' or assurance that once terms were settled for construction of the pipeline, the Government would not make changes that would increase costs. And the waiver package would allow the three oil companies that own the gas reserves in Alaska to purchase part ownership of the line. **********The companies are the Exxon Corporation, the Atlantic Richfield Company and the Standard Oil Company (Ohio), which also produce virtually all the oil from Alaska's North Slope. The British Petroleum Company is majority shareholder in Sohio. **********The line from Prudhoe Bay, running through Canada, would tap a gas supply estimated at about 13 percent of total current United States reserves. Once the Administration's proposals reach Capitol Hill, each chamber has 60 days in which to approve them. **********Since the provisions were generally worked out with key Sena te Energy Committee members, approval by the Sen ate is considered likely. **********Some strong opposition, however, has been expressed in the House, including that of John D. Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan and head of its energy committee. **********A New York banker involved in preliminary fund-raising plans was noncommittal today when asked whether passage of all the waiver items would clear the way to successful financing, mostly by private banks. **********The banker said that thorough financing reviews remained to be conducted, as well as surveys of the eventual marketability of the gas.  Northwest Alaskan has said that if the waiver package was not provided in this session of Congress, the project would have to be shelved. The company has insisted, however, that with the waivers, it could proceed despite any eventual decontrol of gas prices that might make it difficult to market gas brought in through the pipeline. **********The current completion target for the pipeline is now the fall of 1986. Construction of the Canadian and ''Lower-48'' sections is already well advanced and in some areas nearly completed. If a decision was made not to build the Alaskan section, the Canadian and ''Lower 48'' sections would be used to transport Canadian natural gas. **********Other provisions understood to be part of the legislative package include granting Exxon, Atlantic Richfield and Sohio an ''assured minority equity position'' in the line that remained unspecified, but is expected to be at least 30 percent. **********The package, which is not subject to amendment by Congress, also provides for guarantees to Canada so that it can sell its own gas in this country even if the Alaskan section is not built, and permission for the sponsors to include a $6 billion gas-conditioning plant on the North Slope in calculations of its charges to consumers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/business/rossmoor-holders-approve-liquidation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rossmoor Holders Approve Liquidation", "print_headline": "Rossmoor Holders Approve Liquidation", "body_text": " **********Shareholders of the Rossmoor Corporation, the builder that pioneered the concept of the large retirement community and constructed seven Leisure World communities nationwide, have approved a motion to liquidate within 12 months, company officials said. **********A company official said that the move had been discussed in the corporation's last two annual reports and approval had been expected. **********An initial cash distribution in January 1982 of about $10 a share and a second distribution in June 1982 of about $4.25 a share are anticipated. **********The company said rising interest rates, dwindling supplies of large parcels of land near urban centers and a growing number of smaller retirement communities outside the Sun Belt had diminished the profit prospects from building such huge projects as Leisure World, even though the number of retired persons was at record levels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/30/business/nigerian-communications.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nigerian Communications", "print_headline": "Nigerian Communications", "body_text": " **********Three Japanese companies have won an order totaling approximately $72 million to construct a microwave communications system in Ibadan, Nigeria, the Marubeni Corporation said today.

And last year the credit for some types of renewable energy source expenditures was generously increased. **********One imaginative taxpayer last year even claimed the 10 percent investment tax credit, typically claimed for depreciable property such as machinery used in a business, for his extensive home library. The tax court sided with James Ginkel, an English professor at the Ellsworth Community College in Iowa Falls, Iowa, who had spent $1,811 on books used in his college courses, but said that only half the volume he had purchased had qualified for the credit. **********Tax credits, which are enumerated on the back of the long form 1040, are much more valuable than itemized deductions for people in lower tax brackets. A $100 charitable contribution is worth only $14 to someone in the lowest bracket of 14 percent, but worth $70 to someone in the highest bracket, 70 percent. A $100 credit, by contrast, reduces taxes by $100 regardless of a taxpayer's bracket. **********People who hire a baby-sitter or housekeeper to care for their children, even if the parents work only part time or are full-time students, may be able to claim a tax credit for part of the expense, depending on income. For one child, the credit is 20 percent of up to $2,000 in expenses, or a maximum of $400; for two or more children, it is 20 percent of up to $4,000 in expenses, or a maximum of $800. **********To claim the credit, one must maintain a home for a child under the age of 15, or for a dependent, regardless of age, who is mentally or physically incapable of caring for himself or herself. Generally, both spouses must have some earnings from a job or self-employment, unless one of them is disabled or a full-time student. **********For purposes of calculating the credit, a full-time student or disabled spouse is considered to have earned $166 a month if there is one qualifying child or disabled spouse to be cared for, or $333 a month if there are two or more qualifying dependents. Determining the Credit **********The amount of the credit is not determined by combined joint income, but is limited by the income of the lower-paid spouse, or the amount of child-care expenses, whichever is lower. **********Take the case of a couple who spend $2,500 on baby-sitters for their two children during the six months the wife attends college full time. The husband earns $20,000, but the credit is determined by the amount that the wife is considered to have earned: $1,998, or six times $333. The maximum credit they can claim is thus $399.60 (20 percent of $1,998). **********The cost of a housekeeper who also does laundry, cleaning and cooking is deductible. So is the cost of care provided outside the home, for example at a day camp or nursery school. And payments to a relative, such as a grandmother, also qualify for the credit as long as the relative is not also claimed as a dependent. **********The Tax Court has upheld the deductibility of child-care payments, even when a parent has mixed motives for incurring the costs. One case concerned a mother who withdrew her son from a disruptive public school and then took a full-time job after sending him to a boarding school. **********The court allowed her to write off part of the private school costs, even though it noted that she had sent him there not only because she wanted him to get a better education but also because she wanted to work. Energy-Saving Credits **********To encourage energy conservation, Congress several years ago enacted two separate credits for taxpayers who install energy-saving devices in their homes. **********The first credit, for expenditures on residential energy improvements such as storm windows and insulation, is 15 percent of the first $2,000 spent, up to a maximum credit of $300. **********The second, for expenditures on renewable energy source improvements such as solar heating systems, was increased last year to 40 percent of the first $10,000 spent, up to a maximum credit of $4,000. The previous ceiling was $2,200. **********Both credits are limited to improvements made to a principal residence that you own or rent; but the residential energy improvement credit is limited to installations in homes substantially completed before April 20, 1977, while the renewable energy source credit can be claimed for any residence. **********In addition to expenditures on storm doors and windows, the residential energy credit can be claimed for such items as caulking and weatherstripping, automatic set-back thermostats, and moreefficient furnace replacement burners. But dual-purpose home improvements that are primarily decorative in nature, such as fireplaces and wood-burning stoves, or carpeting and drapes, do not qualify. **********You can claim the maximum $300 credit on other qualifying homes you may buy, and the buyer of your old house can also claim a credit of up to $300 if qualifying improvements are made. In addition, the residential energy credit and the renewable energy source credit are calculated separately, so that expenditures for one type of credit do not reduce the other. **********Last year, the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 clarified the confused treatment of joint ownership of energy items qualifying for the credit. Now it is clear, for example, that four owners of adjacent condominium units who each contribute $5,000 of the total $20,000 cost for installing a jointly owned solar heating system serving their units would each be entitled to a credit of $2,000 (40 percent of $5,000). Previously, there was some thought that they might be limited to pro-rating a single maximum credit of $4,000. Political Contributions **********People who made financial contributions in the general election campaign last year may qualify for the political contribution credit. It is half of the amount contributed during the year, up to a maximum credit of $100 for married persons filing jointly ($50 for single taxpayers). This is in addition to the $1 or $2 they may have designated on their tax return for the Presidential election campaign fund. **********To be deductible, political contributions must have been made in money, rather than in property or services. Contributions to newsletter funds established by elected officials or candidates for public office also qualify. **********But last year the I.R.S. ruled that donations to ''negative'' campaigns organized for the purpose of defeating certain candidates were not deductible, saying that the law only allows contributions to further a candidacy. Tax Credit for the Elderly **********People aged 65 or over who receive a small amount of Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, or people under that age who receive a small amount of income from a public retirement system, may be able to claim the tax credit for the elderly. **********The credit, which is determined on a sliding scale based on the amount of income and other benefits a person receives, can range up to $562.50 for a married couple filing jointly. Because the law in this area is complex, and taxpayers have made so many errors in calculating the credit, the I.R.S. will calculate it by mail as long as the necessary information is provided on the return. **********Low-income workers with families may be able to claim the earnedincome credit, a negative income tax that provides a refund or subsidy that can range up to $500.

''We're not buying up a bank here; it's a healthy mutual marriage of our interests,'' said Willard C. Butcher, Chase's chairman, in an interview yesterday. If Chase eventually were to acquire Equimark, it would give the New York bank a strong position throughout the greater Pittsburgh area and the Ohio Valley, he said. **********At the same time, Equimark reported a net operating loss for the second quarter of $33.26 million. In the second quarter of 1980, Equimark showed a $2.5 million profit. Blocked by Federal Law **********At present, however, Federal law prohibits banking companies from acquiring full-service banking subsidiaries outside their own state.  Thus, Chase could not exercise its option until Federal law was changed, if ever. In addition, the proposal is subject to approval by regulatory authorities and by Equimark's shareholders. **********If Chase were to exercise its option, it would pay $75 million for the shares, which is considerably below Equibank's book value of about $104 million. But it also is considerably above the recent market value of about $42 million. **********The bank's equity, however, is greater than that of its parent company, which means that Equimark has a negative net worth.  For years, Equimark and Equibank have experienced low profitability levels and low ratios of equity to total assets. Among the 81 banks in the nation with assets between $2 billion and $5 billion, Equimark last year ranked 80th in terms of return on assets, 78th in terms of return on equity, and 79th in terms of equity as a percentage of its total assets, according to the bank-stock company of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which acted as adviser to Equimark in the transaction. Added Flexibility **********Chase's investment is intended to bolster Equibank's capital position to give it more flexibility in dealing with its problems.  The package will include a $75 million, five-year loan at 14 1/2 percent, secured by United States Government securities; a $25 million investment in newly issued nonvoting preferred shares of Equimark, and an additional $25 million investment in newly issued nonvoting preferred shares of Equibank. **********The preferred shares are to be redeemed in 15 years, with a sinking fund that gives the loan an average life of 10 1/2 years. The dividend rate begins at 7 percent and rises to 14 percent. **********''This is a great opportunity for us to be more aggressive in the market,'' said W.E. Bierer, Equimark's chairman and chief executive officer. ''We're really up on the thing, it couldn't be a better marriage.'' **********Gregory A. Root, vice president of Keefe, Bruyette, said the infusion of capital ''gives Equimark the flexibility it needs to restructure their assets.'' **********In its asset-liability structure, Equimark resembles a savings bank. Of its $2.8 billion in assets, at year-end it had $832 in United States Government securities and $489 million in mortgages.  Many of these investments were made when interest rates were far lower than they are today. Since then, Equimark's cost of funds has risen above the yield on these investments, creating a profit squeeze. **********With the added capital, Equimark will be able to sell some of these investments at a loss and reinvest the money in higher-yielding loans or securities. **********The second-quarter loss was attributed to $35 million in loan write-offs - $20 million at the holding company level, and $15 million at the bank. **********Equimark has total assets of $2.8 billion and is the 82d-largest banking company in the United States.

''We and many other economists anticipated that inflation during this first quarter would probably run quite high.'' However, Mr. Olsen added: ''We expect the inflation rate to slow in the second quarter.'' **********Among the reasons for the added inflation are the sharp rises in raw material prices last summer and fall, the added strength of the economy in recent months and the surge in interest rates, which will show up mostly in the Consumer Price Index, which measures prices at the retail level. **********Helping to moderate last month's rise in the producer price index, however, were finished food prices, which showed no increase at all.  For the last three months, the prices of finished food, ready for sale to a retailer, have risen by less than the overall increase in the index. **********Last month, for example, prices of such finished food items as fresh fruits, eggs, processed poultry, pork and roasted coffee all fell by 2.5 percent or more. The only substantial increases in finished foods were posted by milled rice, fish and soft drinks. **********Still, Labor Department economists warned today that the effect of the cold weather in Florida had not yet appeared in the finished goods index. The prices of oranges, orange juice and other fruits and vegetables grown in Florida have already begun to rise. **********In addition to the index of finished-goods prices, which includes such items as automobiles, the Government keeps track of prices for crude goods, such as commodities and raw farm products, and intermediate goods, made up of items that are only partly processed. **********At the intermediate level - which includes items such as flour, steel and fabric - food prices rose by 1.2 percent last month, the same as the month before. But nonfood items rose by 1.3 percent last month and by 1.7 percent in December. **********Crude goods - such as wheat and raw cotton - fell by 1 percent last month, the second consecutive decline. Such changes can lead to smaller price increases at the finished-goods level and, ultimately, in the prices paid by consumers. **********In January, fuel oil prices increased by 5.7 percent and gasoline rose by 2.5 percent, both more than double the December increases.  Capital equipment prices continued to rise rapidly, up 1 percent last month.

Rosenthal, Democrat of New York, Mr. Haig said attention ''is focused on the Soviet problem'' because ''of the dangerous trends which have resulted in the recent past from Soviet activity.'' **********''It does no good to pretend in our policies or our proclamations that that is not the most serious threat to world peace that we're facing today,'' he said. **********Ostensibly Mr. Haig appeared before the committee to defend the $6.87 billion security assistance program for the 1982 fiscal year, but his appearance was more akin to a news conference, with committee members asking questions. **********Mr. Haig made several other points in his testimony: **********- He indicated that the United States might have to supply some of the 2,500 troops for a peacekeeping force to be established in Sinai in April 1982 if other countries do not volunteer. The United States is obliged, under the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, to take the lead in setting up an international force and some Pentagon officials favor an American presence as the first step toward a permanent land force in the Middle East. **********- Mr. Haig hinted that he favored repeal of a the 1976 law that bars covert aid to anti-Communist rebels in Angola. He said the legislation restricted Presidential authority. Experts on southern Africa have warned that such aid may upset efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement in South-West Africa. **********- He said he favored modification of legislation that bars aid to Pakistan because of a secret program to develop nuclear devices. He said the Administration wanted to avoid isolating countries like Pakistan so that they would not be driven ''toward the nuclear option.'' **********Several committee members expressed concern at the decision to provide Saudi Arabia with additional equipment for F-15 jets it has ordered. In response to a question from the ranking Republican on the committee, Representative William S. Broomfield of Michigan, Mr.  Haig put the Saudi decision in terms of a threat from the Soviet Union. Arab-Jewish Consensus Needed **********''It is fundamentally important to begin to develop a consensus of strategic concerns throughout the region among Arab and Jew and to be sure that the overriding danger of Soviet inroads is not overlooked,'' Mr. Haig said. **********In his opening statement, he said Israel played an important role ''in countering the more serious threats involving the Soviet Union.'' **********The ''most dangerous'' trend in the world, he said, ''is the growth of Soviet military power, which is now capable of supporting an imperial foreign policy.'' **********''Soviet adventurism in the Horn of Africa, in South Asia, in the Persian Gulf, and in South-West Africa appears to conform to a basic and ominous objective: to strike at countries on or near the vital resource lines of the Western world,'' Mr. Haig said in his statement. **********Asked about the concern over Soviet bloc aid to El Salvador, Mr.  Haig told the committee that the insurgency in El Salvador was only part of a ''four-phased operation'' in which the first part was ''the seizure of Nicaragua.'' **********''Next is El Salvador,'' he said, ''to be followed by Honduras and Guatemala.''

Since the $8.5 billion sale is for cash, it would not be affected by the $250 million limit. President to See 7 Senators **********The President has invited seven Senators to the White House tomorrow and White House officials said he planned to see 11 more before Wednesday's vote. **********Senator Baker said during the televised interview that he expected some Senators who were now on record as opposing the Awacs sale to switch and support the President by Wednesday, but he would give no numbers. **********Of 50 Senators who originally sponsored a resolution of disapproval in early September, 47 are still publicly in favor of vetoing the sale, and three have switched to supporting the President in the last three weeks. Three Democratic Senators announced publicly last week that they would vote against the sale. **********Two more Senators have indicated they are almost certain to vote against the President. At least eight members are actually or nominally still uncommitted. **********The opponents of the sale say they do not believe that three or four switches will win for the White House because the opponents expect to pick up a share of the still undeclared votes. **********Walter F. Mondale, the former Vice President, said on the NBC News ''Meet the Press'' program that he believed ''it would be a wise move'' for President Reagan to withdraw the proposed sale before a Senate vote ''in order to avoid an embarrassment.'' **********Mr. Mondale said he had been opposed to the Awacs sale when he was Vice President and ''I'm opposed to it now.'' Former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown have urged Congress to support the sale, while former Secretary of State Cyrus R.

Several hundred activists, most of them young, have fanned out through the villages of the heavily Sikh Punjab evangelizing for independence. In Delhi they go out on graffiti raids at night and leave behind the message, ''The Sikh are a nation.'' **********Mr. Sandhu has sought publicity for his cause by issuing passports in the name of Khalistan, the dreamed-of Sikh homeland that translates as the Country of the Pure. **********Amritsar is the holy city of the Sikhs, and nationalistically aroused Sikhs are leading demonstrations to ban the sale of cigarettes since the use of tobacco is forbidden to Sikhs. **********The Indian Government has responded to the Sikh nationalism with disdain. Asked about the Khalistan agitation, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said, ''It is in the United States and Canada,'' a reference to Sikhs living abroad who are supporting the movement. The Police Move Cautiously **********The police in the Punjab have arrested only a handful of the activists on charges of insulting the Constitution, clearly aware that the 512-year-old religion venerates its martyrs and that a crackdown could increase support for the activists. **********''If they seek to stop us by force, we will only grow that much faster,'' said Gajender Singh, a 30-year-old organizer for the Khalsa Dal, or Society of the Pure, a group that he said was being patterned after the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********Like Mr. Sandhu, who belongs to a different faction, Gajender Singh spends his days in the Sikh hostel attached to the Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine. It is from this sanctuary that they maintain contact with the 1,500 activists they say belong to their two groups. **********''We are maturing,'' said Gajender Singh. ''We have finished with the organizational stage and are now involved in propagation. Next will come direct action and then, finally, full-scale confrontation.  Like the P.L.O., we are seeking international recognition, and at home we are prepared to use terror, the political language of the 20th century.'' A Challenge to National Unity **********Though Indian authorities are showing restraint and treating such pronouncements as bluster, they are clearly aware that Sikh nationalism, even in incipient form, poses a challenge to national unity and the commitment to secular political development. **********The Punjab has a sensitive geography, adjoining Pakistan just south of Kashmir, the Indian state long sought by Pakistan.  There is widespread dissatisfaction among Sikhs who, though not ready to demand independence, say of themselves that they are an industrious and enterprising people who have contributed more to India than they have received. **********Activist Sikhs contend that the Sikhs were deceived at the time of partition. ''The British were willing to provide us with our homeland, but we were talked out of this by Nehru and Gandhi,'' said Mr. Sandhu, who calls himself the secretary general of the national council of Khalistan. ''The Hindus said that we would share with them in the Government, but they lied. What we are facing is Hindu imperialism, which threatens our integrity.'' Sikhs Do Not Cut Their Hair **********The Sikhs practice a monotheistic religion that arose as an attempt to synthesize Islam and Hinduism. A practicing male Sikh proclaims his identity by never cutting his hair, by wearing a dagger and an iron bracelet and by using the name Singh, which means lion. **********According to census statistics, Sikhs are among the better-off groups in India. Though forming less than 2 percent of the population, they account for more than 8 percent of the army and close to half the Olympic athletes. **********The Punjab has the richest farms and the highest per capita income. Sikh farmers produce the largest grain surpluses. They are a sizable and prominent minority in Delhi. They have a reputation for energy and enterprise, but it is sometimes rendered as pushiness and aggressiveness. Many Sikhs are active in politics; the important post of Home Minister is held by a Sikh, Zail Singh. **********Narendrajit Singh is the official spokesman for the Golden Temple and as such reflects the Sikh establishment. He disassociates himself from the activists but acknowledges that many of their grievances are valid. A List of Complaints **********''The Punjab is well off, but it is due to ourselves and our efforts and not the Government,'' he said.  Subsidies on fertilizers have been removed. Sikh farmers are discouraged from selling grain at world prices and are coerced into selling at lower Government prices. But worst of all, he said, the Government is withholding licenses from the Punjab, depriving talented Sikhs of opportunities to share in major industrial projects. **********Narendrajit Singh said he did not think that many Sikhs wanted to break with India.  ''Many of us like myself came over from Pakistan during partition and we know what it is like,'' he said. But he said most Sikhs feel they are thwarted rather than aided by the Government. **********For Gajender Singh, the ardent young nationalist, the material inequities are insignificant. Fighting for Their Identity **********''Even if we had industries and even if every member of the Indian Cabinet was a Sikh, we would still want independence because what we are fighting for is our cultural integrity,'' he said. **********Khushwant Singh, an editor and author who has written a two-volume history of his people, has said that a pervasive fear among the Sikhs is that they may be absorbed by the elasticity of Hinduism. This happened to another sect, the Jains. **********''The Indians say they have a secular state, but it is really a Hindu state and it advances Hindu imperialism,'' said Gajender Singh. ''They say that Sikhism is really a part of Hinduism. This is false.  This land was ruled by Sikhs and it will be ruled by Sikhs.'' **********He pointed to a map in his room that showed the Punjabi-speaking areas of India, which have as many Hindus as they have Sikhs, as the area of Khalistan. Sikhs Play the Kashmir Card **********Such assertions of cultural identity would be largely of anthropological interest if not for the presence of Pakistan and Kashmir, and this is a card that the activists are playing. **********''We have no problem with Pakistan,'' said Balbhir Singh Sandhu.  Gajender Singh said his group was trying to establish close contacts with Jamiat-e-Islami, an organization of Moslem fundamentalists in Kashmir who favor ties to Pakistan. **********''One day the people of Kashmir will turn to Pakistan and we will benefit,'' said Gajender Singh. ''One thing is certain: the next war with Pakistan will result in a Pakistani Kashmir and a sovereign Khalistan.'' **********It may be bluster, but it is troublesome bluster for an Indian Government that says it is trying to preserve a secular orientation.  The Government has been embarrassed by recent efforts by Sikhs to get associate status at the United Nations for Khalistan groups. Sikhs Seek Refugee Status **********In recent weeks, more than a thousand Sikhs went to Canada on visitor permits and tried to gain permanent entry by declaring themselves political refugees victimized by India because of their demands for an independent Khalistan. The Canadians have dismissed the claims, accusing unscrupulous Indian travel agents of concocting the ploy as a way around Canadian immigration laws. **********The Communist press here has written that the Khalistan issue is a creation of the American Central Intelligence Agency, which pro-Soviet papers say is working to strengthen Pakistan and weaken India. **********Gajender Singh and Balbhir Singh Sandhu deny that they have any links to the West, but Gajender Singh adds, ''We would be willing to accept help from any foreign country.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/25/business/eastern-shuttle-fare.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Eastern Shuttle Fare", "print_headline": "Eastern Shuttle Fare", "body_text": " **********Eastern Airlines said it would cut to $29 its one-way fare on selected shuttle flights between New York, Boston and Washington for passengers between ages 2 and 21. **********Regular fares normally are $59 between New York and Washington, and $49 between New York and Boston.

The analyst would not identify the destinations of the armored units, but sources at North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters said they believed that the tanks had been sent to the Gdansk and Warsaw regions. **********The Soviet divisions appear to be playing a backup role.  Intelligence sources say that the Soviet Union does not want to intervene but that Soviet political and military leaders hold that, if the Polish repression fails, intervention may be necessary to stifle a movement that could have the gravest effect on the rest of the Soviet bloc. **********Cloud Cover Hinders Information **********Intelligence gathering about Soviet movements has been impeded by the heavy cloud cover that has blanketed eastern Europe since Monday.  Analysts could not confirm persistent rumors that Soviet landing craft were being loaded with troops at Riga, Latvia, and at other ports on the Baltic Sea in preparation for a landing on Poland's northern coast. **********Pentagon sources, however, said that a sea landing would be an expensive and complicated form of intervention, considering that Soviet forces control major airfields in Poland and would probably have little difficulty in transporting troops and equipment by road or rail. **********American and NATO analysts said they were surprised by the criticism that United States intelligence had failed to anticipate the use of Polish forces rather than the Soviet Army against Solidarity. **********Richard N. Perle, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, said Thursday that there had been ''a collective failure'' in intelligence gathering and assessment before the Polish Army moved. Mr. Perle asserted that American concern over the possibility of Soviet involvement resulted in insufficient concentration on the Polish Army's mission. **********Military analysts pointed out, however, that there was no reliable way of monitoring a Polish operation that they said they believed was the result of verbal orders issued by the high command.

Kulikov, the Soviet officer who commands all Warsaw Pact forces, before he left the Polish capital on Dec. 15.

His brief statement followed by only a few days the introduction of the latest installment in legislation changing the labor laws, a bill that was remarkable for South Africa in that it makes no reference to race in seeking to define the legal role of trade unions in the industrial system. **********But while the legislation was giving black unions legitimate status, the security police memorandum to employers in East London, an industrial port on the Indian Ocean, made a series of proposals designed ''to break the power'' of unions that are determined to be outspoken on political issues. The employers, for instance, were counseled to keep a register of unemployed people ''who could start work at very short notice'' in the event of a strike. **********New Status for Black Unions **********Until two years ago, black trade unions had no legal status, and employers were under no obligation to deal with them. Few of them, in fact, did. **********Now black unions can operate under the industrial conciliation system, which was originally designed for white workers who seldom threatened to strike since their privileges were defined on a racial basis and entrenched in the law. The new black unions have split on the question of whether that system can meet the needs of the mass of low-paid, unskilled or semiskilled black laborers who fill about 60 percent of all manufacturing jobs. **********Unions that have refused to register under the existing industrial conciliation system have been the ones most closely monitored by the security police. These include the African Food and Canning Workers Union in Cape Town, whose national organizer, Oscar Mpheta, is now the main figure in an elaborately-staged murder and terrorism trial here; the Motor Assemblies and Components Workers Union, a new group that has taken root at the Ford Motor Company in Port Elizabeth and spread from there to neighboring factories, and the South African Allied Workers Union of East London. Union Says It Is Succeeding **********The leaders of the East London union have been repeatedly arrested and detained without charge in the last year, but despite the arrests it says it has signed up a membership of 16,000 black workers in that time. About 2,000 of those have since been dismissed as a result of strikes and other confrontations with East London companies, only one of which has entered into a formal collective-bargaining agreement with the union. **********Others, including two American-owned companies, Johnson & Johnson and Hoover Appliances, have acknowledged that the union has won the allegiance of a majority of their black workers, and they have negotiated with its leaders on the question of formal recognition without reaching an agreement. The publication of the security police memorandum confirmed earlier reports that the companies have been under official pressure to withhold recognition. **********The memorandum declared that the leaders of various business organizations in East London had been attending meetings, presumably with representatives of the security police, ''where the aims of S.A.A.W.U. are explained to them as well as the necessity of uniform action by industry in East London against S.A.A.W.U.'' The S.A.A.W.U. is the South African Allied Workers Union. 'Do Not Have to Fear a Strike' **********The memorandum suggested that the lists of unemployed people in the area be kept at a ''central point'' so that ''firms with labor differences or problems can be informed about these lists and the number of unemployed persons looking for work and therefore do not have to fear a strike.'' **********The text of the memorandum was printed in The South African Labor Bulletin, a journal for social scientists and union activists, but it said the document was jointly drafted by the security police, the Ministry of Manpower Utilization and the Ministry of Cooperation and Development. The memorandum blames much of the ferment among black workers in recent years on ''white agitators,'' and asserts that workers were being ''indoctrinated.'' **********''One can expect that in the near future East London will be plagued by a wave of strikes,'' the memorandum warns. A police raid on the union's office, it says, revealed that it had potential organizers ''in practically every big business or industry in East London.'' One Solution Is Mentioned **********The memorandum concedes that black workers have real grievances, such as low wages and separation from their families under the South African migrant labor system. But when it speaks of ''long-term solutions'' for the problem of labor militancy, it mentions only the possibility of legislation to force black unions to limit their activities to specific industries. Such a law, the document suggests, would inhibit the growth of a labor movement capable of calling a general strike on a local or national basis. **********It also suggests that employers should seek to ''activate and motivate'' the Trade Union Congress of South Africa, a white-led movement that has been signing black workers in competition with the unions that are led by blacks. **********The memorandum is reported to have been circulated late last year.  Since then, companies in East London that have faced strikes by the South African Allied Workers Union have tended to discharge the strikers, hire unemployed workers and negotiate agreements with white-led unions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/24/business/united-medical-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNITED MEDICAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "UNITED MEDICAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/business/kaufman-broad-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KAUFMAN & BROAD INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "print_headline": "KAUFMAN & BROAD INC reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/27/business/briefs-248727.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 408, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Briefs", "print_headline": "Briefs", "body_text": " *********** Charles Schwab & Co. said that it had agreed to acquire the Baltimore and Laurel, Md., offices of Brokers Exchange Inc. for an undisclosed price.

What once seemed as unlikely as $850 gold or an 18 percent Treasury bill is here. Suddenly, oil is so plentiful that prices are falling by amounts that impress even big-time corporate decisionmakers. **********Businesses across the country, which for a decade have seen nothing but oil stealing an ever larger bite of their operating dollar, are calculating what they can do to capitalize on the oil price drop. While most such adjustments are quick and modest, some companies are already puzzling over how to factor the newly favorable oil situation into longer range plans as well. **********To be sure, the dominant mood remains one of great caution. After all, world energy consumers have watched helplessly for years as the price of oil raced in breathtaking spurts from next to nothing to more than $40 a barrel while consumers endured periodic shortages that made some wonder if oil would ever be freely available again. **********''The surplus could be with us a while,'' said James E. McNabb, an economist for Conoco Inc., a major oil, natural gas and coal producer. ''But it should be viewed as a temporary phenomenon that could change overnight,'' he added. ''In the world of corporate planning we're learning not to overreact to immediate situations.'' **********At company after company, however, there is evidence that the glut and price break are being taken seriously enough to influence planning. **********Take the case of John B. Walters, manager of the Firestone Tire & Rubber Company's largest plant. Tomorrow morning in Des Moines, Mr.  Walters will sit down to study fresh Department of Energy figures dictating what he must pay for natural gas. He will probably conclude that the plant should switch in July to burning oil instead. The heavy No. 6 oil his plant is also equipped to use has tumbled in price recently, wiping out what was once a large advantage for gas. **********''We're fighting for our jobs out here,'' Mr. Walters declared, noting that in the past Firestone has often had to shift some production to Illinois, where gas is cheaper than in Iowa. **********''We have to look at the economics of it,'' Mr. Walters added. ''If oil is cheaper, we'll use it - and it certainly looks that way.'' The Consolidated Edison Company, which alone burns about 1 percent of the nation's oil, is looking at ''every cargo'' being offered these days in New York harbor, though it has not yet raised its purchases much because of the high cost of financing inventories and a lack of storage space. **********The Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company is being offered diesel oil contracts for up to a year, something suppliers ''haven't been willing to do until very recently,'' a spokesman says. (Price, however, is still adjustable.) **********Airline entrepreneur Dan A. Colussy, who recently announced plans to create a new short-haul line on the East Coast, says he is tempted to buy his jet fuel in the spot market, though he will probably decide he can't take such a risk. **********As an indication of how things might change over the longer term, the Caterpillar Tractor Company says that if oil supplies remain ample, it might decide to design new plants to burn oil with natural gas as a backup, reversing current practice. **********For the first time in many years corporate strategists do not have to automatically assume that oil prices will be rising by at least the inflation rate and probably by much more. **********Already some serious students of energy are arguing that no price increase exceeding the inflation rate is likely during the next two years. They say price-induced conservation has now cut Western demand so greatly that it has caused some disarray within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. **********When OPEC failed at its meeting last month to come to an agreement on cutting production, and thus taking the edge off the glut, the price impact was quick to be felt. Most OPEC nations eliminated any surcharges over the official price still in effect and Ecuador actually cut its official price by $3.80 a barrel. **********Among nonmembers, Mexico dropped its price $4 a barrel to the $28-to-$34.50-a-barrel range. (While it later rescinded that cut, domestic political reasons were cited, not oil economics.) And Britain announced a $2-a-barrel cut, later deepened to $4.25, that brought its North Sea crude down to $35 a barrel, roughly in line with Saudi Arabia, the lowest-price OPEC member. The spot price, for oil not under long-term contract, has fallen below $32 a barrel for the first time since last August, after jumping above $42 in November after the Iran-Iraq war broke out. **********But though the profitability of many fuel-sensitive industries - airlines, utilities, metals and paper - is significantly enhanced by the current decline in oil prices, interviews with a score of business planners show them to be profoundly skeptical that a new era has arrived. Most companies still have far to go in adjusting to the price increases that have already occurred. **********American Airlines, for example, has recently decided to retire the last of its fuel-thirsty 707's by the end of August instead of in mid-September. Executives of the Santa Fe are making public speeches these days in which company research into the aerodynamics of locomotives and freight cars, to improve fuel efficiency, is a major theme. **********The reluctance of corporate planners to embrace the notion of stable oil prices indefinitely owes much to the severity of the jolts of the 1970's and the fact that while the narrow economics of oil may have changed for the better, the politics of the situation has not.  the Middle East, dominant supplier to America's allies in Europe and a major source for the United States itself, remains as unstable as ever. **********''The biggest effect of the oil surplus on us so far is that we're guessing this element of costs will go up at a lower rate than we were previously forecasting,'' said David K. Barnes, a senior vice president of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, who doubts that companies can yet safely shift their long-range view of energy prices and supplies. ''It's just a moderation of the cost - and not an opportunity for strategic change.'' **********Du Pont, which relies on oil and natural gas as a feedstock in 70 percent of its products, will continue to push its program to use more coal as a plant power source. **********Company officials also point out that despite almost daily headlines about sharp declines in OPEC and other oil prices, it takes time for these to flow through to individual businesses, many of which also use large amounts of increasingly expensive natural gas. **********And unlike oil, which in January was totally freed of United States price controls, a move that itself may have contributed to the current price decline by inducing more conservation, natural gas is to rise steadily by statute until at least 1985. **********The country's car and truck manufacturers, not surprisingly, appear the most optimistic about oil, though there is no intention to, say, revive the V-8 engine because of lower gasoline prices or the rebound in prices for big used cars in certain areas. **********The oil surplus, says a spokesman for the General Motors Corporation, ''might make us relax a little bit about the automobile sales picture. If the perception increases that there is an ample supply of gasoline, that we'd see as highly positive.'' **********According to Jacques R. Maroni, director of energy planning for the Ford Motor Company, there has never been a genuine fuel shortage for cars and there probably will not be for a century or more. **********He says the facts about oil have not changed, simply the perception of them. ''There was no shortage, there is no glut,'' Mr. Maroni asserted. Supplies, in other words, have moved from below ground in the oil fields to oil-company storage tanks. **********''What we now have is a gradual settling back down (of prices) so oil does not lose its markets,'' Mr. Maroni continued. During the next few years ''you're going to find a generously supplied oil market at a price which will not rise in real terms.'' In fact, because of the availability of alternative fuels he said there is ''no fuels he said there is ''no reason'' why the price of gasoline should ever rise above $2 a gallon after adjusting for future after adjusting for future inflation. **********OPEC, he declared, is just ''a trade association, a country club'' dominated by Saudi Arabia, which he thinks for political reasons may be forced to let real prices actually decline for an extended period. **********The Department of Energy, meanwhile, has made no change in the basic assumption it has used for the past two years that oil prices will show annual real price increases of about 3 percent during the 1980's and 1990's. **********But, according to Roger F. Naill, associate director for energy analysis, this may now not apply over the next two years or so.  What's happening now, he said, ''seems a natural reacin 1979. One should have expected to see a glut.'' Nonetheless, the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Energy Department, did not. Its quarterly short-term forecast in February for 1981 gasoline prices -stickers so annual fuel costs can be computed - was $1.55 a gallon, far above today's price. A year earlier this forecast was much too low, 90 cents a gallon. **********Though American companies are not rushing to revise long-term plans, some are being forced to react quickly to lower oil prices right now. **********Perhaps the most threatened are natural gas pipelines, which are already losing business from people like Firestone's Mr. Walters and are in danger of losing lots more. **********''The oil jobbers have been able to come in and undercut the price,'' complained Kenneth W. Thompson, a vice president of the Interstate Natural Gas Association, a trade group. One constituent, he said, has lost seven industrial customers in recent weeks after they found cheap residual oil ''dumped'' by refiners to fire their plants instead. **********''When they've got a glut of No. 6 oil they have to get rid of it,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''The people they market it to are our marginal users. This is something we are very concerned about in terms of the future of our industry.'' **********In its apparent eagerness to keep Firestone on natural gas, Mr.  Walters said, his supplier, the Iowa Power & Light Company, has been getting a bit ''clever'' about pricing recently, he observed. **********Some planners say that synthetic fuels projects may also prove to be casualties of the current oil market.  ''I suspect there is some careful rethinking of projects just on the border,'' said Mr. McNabb of Conoco, whose own company scrubbed a proposed synthetic gas plant this spring. **********Just last week the new chairman of the Synthetic Fuels Corporation, Edward E. Noble, told the chief sponsor of the Great Plains Coal Gasification project in North Dakota he had doubts both about the need for the gas and the price it would have to command. **********Although the oil surplus is an internatinal phenomenon, the main beneficiary of falling prices so far has been the United States. This is because oil is priced in dollars and for various reasons, including lower American oil imports and high interest rates, the dollar has been very strong against most other currencies. **********Thus, according to Mr. Maroni of Ford, Europeans think prices are still rising and therefore buying less gasoline.  ''Overseas,'' he declared, ''I detect quite a bit of price resistance,'' a fact that bodes well for continued oil surpluses and for American oil users."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/29/business/finance-briefs-105827.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 301, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Brascan Ltd. has fully placed its $100 million offering of $25 par 10.75 percent cumulative redeemable 1981 series A preferred shares through an underwriting group lead by Dominion Securities Ltd. *********** The Children's Place Inc. is offering 700,000 shares of common stock at $12.50 a share, to be sold through a Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation group. *********** Delmarva Power and Light Company plans to sell up to 2.5 million common shares. *********** Digital Equipment Corporation said it planned public offerings of shares of common and up to $200 million of long-term senior debt subject to market conditions.

At the Plaza, where the Association of National Advertisers Television Workshop began its two-day stay, the interest was in programming. At the New York Hilton, where the Advertising Research Foundation was finishing up its two-day conference, the stress was on audience measurement. **********And there was agreement at both that while the cable industry is still aborning it is time to act.  ''The possibilities are endless and the opportunities for the advertiser to become involved and help shape the programming of tomorrow exist today,'' said Michael Lepiner, president of Telecom Entertainment, a newly formed subsidiary of Benton & Bowles. A young man, Mr. Lepiner, probably is not aware of how in the early days of television critics decried the involvement of advertisers in programming. **********So he could say of the lack of current involvement: ''I believe many of you today would have preferred a more direct role creatively and economically in the program product which is your avenue to the public and one of the largest expenditures of your business.'' **********''In an industry which you singly support financially, it is ironic that you exercise so little creative and financial control of your destiny.'' **********Bristol-Myers, an advertiser with a keen interest in cable, was represented among the speakers by Robert Turner, its director of advertising services. He saw great promise for cable in the way regular television is moving toward greater audience selectivity - advertisers, for economic reasons, using programming to more closely define target groups. **********He said that even though for a long time to come cable would not offer sizable audiences, it would constitute a reasonable advertising buy since it offered a low-cost way to reach a well-defined audience with frequency. **********His company last week announced that it had signed an agreement with the USA Cable Network to present 10 hours a week of healthoriented original programming for 10 years starting next October. **********Over at the A.R.F. conference, Ronald B. Kaatz, a senior vice president of the J. Walter Thompson Company, reminded his audience that a cable measurement committee made up of people from both the advertising and cable industries was already at work evaluating proposals for cable audience-measuring methodology, probably the ''first time in the media research world that the buyers and sellers of a medium are consulting before a technique is developed as to just what it should look like.'' **********To those who think that cable will offer selectivity of audience much as specialty magazines and radio do, Mr. Kaatz said: ''Not so, if you regard cable as a new and distinct media form which will offer high viewer involvement and be in many ways close to direct mail, direct response and shopping newspapers than to television.  There must be acknowledgement of this before we design the calipers to measure cable.'' **********He warned of a new phenomenon, or at least the aggravation of a current one, with the increase in the number of channels to watch.  More flipping. In Canada, he reported, where there is 70 percent penetration by cable, there is a game popular among the young called zapping. The object is to see how long you can view the tube without sitting through a commercial. What's the record? **********The lead speaker at the A.N.A.-TV Workshop was A.B. Priemer, director of advertising services of S.C. Johnson and known throughout the business as Gus. He spoke about an economically important topic of wear-out, that is when TV commercials start to lose their effectiveness from too much viewing. His well-made point was that before such a thing as wear-out can be measured it must first be discovered how advertising works. **********''Wearing out means, or should mean, a decline in the working of a TV commercial,'' he said. ''We obviously can't measure the decline of this invisible, untelligible process.'' **********Mr. Priemer got off a number of keen observations, not the least of which was his comment on the value of high recall scores for advertising. ''Most of you would remember a commercial for a solarpowered nose-warmer,'' he said. ''You wouldn't buy one, but you wouldn't forget it either.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/14/business/investor-interest-in-st-joe-eases.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1981-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 685, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTOR INTEREST IN ST.

''They thought they'd get $55; now they may get something in the high 40's or low 50's.'' **********Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, a Canadian wine and liquor company, has offered to pay $45 a share, or some $2 billion, but Wall Street bankers expect St. Joe to resist the proposal. They say there is a strong possibility that Seagram will have to sweeten the price. **********In a related matter, Seagram said yesterday that it had amended a lawsuit filed Wednesday against St. Joe and Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York State. The original suit, now in abeyance by mutual agreement between Seagram and St. Joe, was designed to block a New York State takeover law giving Mr. Abrams the right to call a hearing in acquisition cases. **********The amendment charged St. Joe with ''false and misleading'' statements last Wednesday and Thursday that the $45 offer was ''grossly inadequate.'' Seagram contended that St. Joe had not conducted any study adequate enough to support such a statement, and that it had made the statement to mislead St. Joe investors. Large Mineral Holdings **********St. Joe, the nation's largest lead producer, also has vast oil and gas operations in the United States and in Canada and owns immense coal deposits in a joint venture with the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. **********Stephen A. Royce, one Wall Street professional, remarked, ''The stock market is saying they'll come to a friendly deal, but at a higher price.'' **********''Somebody else may buy St. Joe,'' another said, ''although I don't believe they're talking to anyone else. Even so, St. Joe will ultimately be sold.'' **********By the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, more than 625,000 St. Joe shares had been traded. Professional traders already have purchased an estimated one million shares, worth almost $50 million, since the Seagram offer on Wednesday. The unwelcome offer is regarded by independent analysts as somewhat low -even though St. Joe shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange 48 hours before the bid at less than $28. The magic number, some Wall Street analysts say, may eventually top $50. **********One of the key factors in the bid is the Canadian Government. Since St. Joe has major Canadian oil and gas holdings, the Canadian Government -which is taking a harder line on foreign control of Canadian companies and Canadian energy resources - would look more favorably on Seagram, as a Canadian company, than on an American company that might attempt to rescue St. Joe. Alternative Plans **********Then again, if St. Joe can fight hard enough to fend off Seagram, there is always an outside chance that St. Joe could keep its stockholders contented by either going private or liquidating the company's assets and distributing the cash to stockholders. **********An even greater long shot, as viewed by some analysts, might be for St. Joe to support the formation of a consortium to buy the company.  Such a consortium might consist of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and the Newmont Mining Company, which already have strong financial ties to St. Joe, and a third partner, such as a Canadian oil company. **********A Wall Street analysis of the takeover concluded that the likelihood of another company coming forward to outbid Seagram seemed remote. Few oil companies would attempt it, one reasoned, because St. Joe's vast coal holdings would almost surely set off an antitrust investigation, creating delay, if nothing more. Many American oil companies, moreover, are getting out of Canada because of impending energy legislation restricting foreign ownership. **********Several analysts said that the most conservative approach seemed to be that St. Joe might ultimately change hands for a price as high as $51 or $52."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/05/business/post-may-sell-sports-magazine.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Pace", "pub_date": "1981-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 727, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POST MAY SELL SPORTS MAGAZINE", "print_headline": "POST MAY SELL SPORTS MAGAZINE", "body_text": " **********The Washington Post Company announced yesterday that it was discussing with prospective buyers the sale of its money-losing sports magazine, Inside Sports. **********The Post company's new president, Richard D. Simmons, said it had been concluded that the monthly magazine ''does not fit into the long-range strategic plans of the company.'' **********He did not elaborate, but Ellen Berland Sachar, vice president and media analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said the magazine evidently ''didn't have the kind of popularity, either with the readers or the advertisers, that they hoped it would have.'' **********Martin Cohen, the Post company's vice president for finance, said Inside Sports was continuing to lose money, although not as much as in 1980, when it was founded by Newsweek Inc., part of the Post company's magazine and book division. **********Inside Sports began regular publication in April 1980 and lost $12 million during the year, which was $4 million more than the Post company had projected. Mr. Cohen declined to give figures on losses so far this year. **********Mr. Cohen, who was reached at the company's New York offices, declined to say with whom it was holding the sales discussions, who might buy the magazine or what price it might fetch. Meanwhile, it is to continue appearing. **********Inside Sports' losses, analysts said, have been swelled by heavy promotion expenditures. For example, one newspaper advertisement that appeared on Tuesday was headlined ''Inside Sports . . . Growing Strong.'' **********''Our numbers sound like a much older, well-established magazine,'' the advertisement said in part. ''In 1980 Inside Sports earned over $12 million in total revenue. We now have 5 million readers per issue. And we're showing a 115 percent increase in new subscribers in 1981 alone. Plus 75 new advertisers. And more.'' **********Terry MacDonald, a senior vice president at the advertising agency Young & Rubicam, said: ''Sports Illustrated is clearly a better editorial product than Inside Sports, and it seems to me that Inside Sports has not found its editorial niche. The editorial content has been varying. In one issue the cover story was very gossipy, and in the next one it was more serious.'' Sports Illustrated is published by Time Inc. **********She suggested that Inside Sports' appeal to advertisers was limited because if they were going to advertise ''in a sports book, they would probably think of Sports Illustrated first.'' Influence of Simmons **********Commenting on the prospective sale, John S. Reidy, media analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert, said it seemed to be part of ''a program furthered under Richard Simmons, who took his post in September.'' He added, ''What they're really doing is deploying their assets in businesses that appear to be working.'' **********The Post company, which had been in the black, showed a net loss of $440,000 in this year's third quarter, compared with net income of $2,509,000 last year. The company reported revenues of $175,289,000 in the latest quarter, up from $152,510,000 in the 1980 period. The Post company's stock closed yesterday at 31 1/8, up 7/8, in trading on the American Stock Exchange. **********The loss, Mr. Reidy said, largely reflected investment to capitalize on the closing in August of the rival Washington Star, an afternoon newspaper. The Washington Post, a morning newspaper, has subsequently increased its daily circulation by more than 150,000. **********Mr. Reidy also said it was reasonable to assume that the Post company might be considering an afternoon tabloid newspaper, a project that was reportedly discussed and rejected within the Post company earlier this year. **********He noted that the Post company last month sold The Trenton Times, which it had owned since 1974. The paper had fought a losing circulation war with the rival Trentonian in recent years. Publishing sources said the price was between $10 million and $12 million. **********''So a couple of operations which don't look all that good are going bye-bye,'' Mr. Reidy continued, ''From an earnings and growth point of view, if you can't make them work, then you should get rid of them.'' **********He predicted that Inside Sports' eventual sale price would be no more than $10 million, adding, ''I would think it would be a lot less, maybe a few million maximum, and it could be even less than that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/30/business/hello-la-miami-hong-kong-come-in-to-the-conference-room.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Bergreen", "pub_date": "1981-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1661, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HELLO L.A.?

COME IN TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM", "body_text": " **********T WO months before he was elected President, after shaking countless hands and meeting thousands of people face-to-face, Ronald Reagan addressed an estimated 50,000 campaign workers, with a ringing recruiting and morale-building speech. **********This time, it was all done without boarding yet another plane, crossing another time zone, or making a single whistle stop. His recorded message, traveling via satellite, was played before audiences at 86 Holiday Inns around the country. Like many corporate executives, Ronald Reagan had discovered teleconferencing. **********A neologism denoting a televised meeting, teleconferencing is changing the way a number of American corporations - including International Business Machines, Aetna Insurance, and Atlantic Richfield transact their business. Applications range from vast national hookups resembling a televised press conference to intimate, one-to-one conversations akin to a telephone call with pictures. **********As soaring air fares and hotel room rates cut sharply into corporate travel budgets and executives complain about time lost and discomfort endured in travel, many corporations are turning to electronics. That's fine with a growing number of businesses that cater to the demand, including the Memphis-based Holiday Inn chain and venturesome entrepreneurs. **********Though only now attracting widespread attention, this aspect of the electronic communications revolution has been developing since 1964, when the American Telephone and Telegraph Company demonstrated and heavily promoted its Picturephone service at the New York World's Fair. **********The device never caught on, largely because the user had to go to an A.T.& T. office, rather than operate out of his own office or a relatively accessible hotel location. (While Ma Bell maintains two conference rooms in New York as well as in other cities around the country - using far more sophisticated equipment than the old Picturephone - the problem of limited, fixed locations has continued to plague the operation.) **********But the potential was recognized even in the early days by the state of South Carolina, which saw in it a new use for its already established Education TeleVision system. Now 11 years old, South Carolina's teleconferencing network links more than 90 installations and 16 two-way sites via the We@star I and Satcom I communications satellites. System uses are rather mundane, but vital: training poll managers, volunteer firemen, nurses, and ambulance drivers. **********The psychological drawbacks are generally acknowledged. ''People miss the personal and social cueing of a face-to-face meeting,'' as Kent Nickerson of South Carolina's ETV explained. ''There's also the joy of being away from the routine to do something special.'' **********Or as a salesman for Atlantic Richfield, which is spending $20 million on an eight-location teleconferencing system, puts it, ''This is excellent for waving the flag, but I can't press the flesh.'' **********But cost-effectiveness, highlighted by the travel delays during the air controllers' strike, is providing a real boost to the stayat-home meeting. And, as Jody Brightman, consultant on teleconferencing at Atlantic Richfield, said, ''Most people after four or five minutes stop feeling unnatural and establish rapport.'' **********Indeed, companies that shunned the teleconference in an era when gasoline was cheap and communications satellites (a prerequisite for most teleconferences) scarce are now investing heavily in the necessary hardware. **********Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield, for one, with broadly scattered operations (two of its teleconferencing sites are to be in Alaska, one in Anchorage and one in remote Prudhoe Bay) expects to trim 23 percent from its travel costs when the system is fully operational, perhaps as early as next year. That's not to mention the savings on wear and tear of senior executives, for whom the romance of travel has faded. **********A S ambitious as such individual corporate systems sound, they are dwarfed by Satellite Business Systems of McLean, Va. S.B.S. was set up in 1975 by International Business Machines, Aetna Insurance, and Comsat, which by the end of this year will have poured $590 million into the venture. **********S.B.S. launched its own communications satellite last year (a second is due to go up this Thursday), and its three parent companies expect to use it for their own teleconferencing needs as well as offering its services to other businesses. **********S.B.S. systems won't come cheap. The company predicts an installation cost of $100,000 per room.  Given the costs involved, a number of organizations have capitalized either on existing equipment - television station WNET in New York is one example - or existing sites to offer others a relatively low-cost teleconference. **********Chief among the less expensive tier is the Holiday Inn chain, promoting a teleconference network linking more than 165 of its inns. Users, aside from President Reagan, have included Warner Brothers, which introduced a new Elton John record to distributors via the Inn system. Compared with an in-house system, prices are low. A standard $21,000 fee covers a group of 350 - equivalent to $60 a person, or substantially less than it would cost to transport and maintain someone attending a conventional meeting in a distant city. **********On a smaller scale, VideoNet, a company with offices on both coasts, sublets the Holiday Inn network to arrange teleconferences for other companies as well as ''teleseminars,'' usually on economic topics, for individual paying customers. VideoNet president Gary Badoud, who started the company in 1979, says he has booked 28 ''satellite events'' for this year, estimated to involve about 90,000 people. ''Within three to five years,'' he maintains, ''there are going to be 20 VideoNets doing this.'' **********One of the problems with the new medium is television itself. The late Marshall McLuhan was right; the medium is indeed the message, and once television intrudes on a meeting, it has a way of wheedling its way onto center stage and staying there. **********Recognizing this, S.B.S., according to a company spokeman, has determined ''to avoid anything that smacks of the broadcast studio's lighting and equipment.'' To this end, S.B.S. installations will have recessed cameras and lights, two large projection screens at opposite ends of the conference room, and a U-shaped table permitting participants to face screens and cameras. **********The conference leader controls camera views and close-ups, zooms and graphics. S.B.S. maintains that such gadgets are no more difficult to operate than a slide projector, but it is apparent that they enhance the power of the conference leader. It would be futile to interrupt without the assistance of a camera and microphone. **********Conferees should also keep in mind that often the television picture is not of the same caliber as the one viewers see at home.  Gus Morck, chief architect of the Atlantic Richfield system, notes that his system compresses television signals in order to shoehorn at least 30 video channels onto a single satellite transponder. In the resulting picture, rapid movement produces distortion. **********Then there is the secrecy problem. Not every executive wants to broadcast those confidential understandings and off-the-cuff remarks that pervade a face-to-face meeting. More seriously, there is the danger of giving a competitor easy access to secrets, strategies, and personal relationships as they are transmitted from one site to another. To combat this problem, both S.B.S. and Atlantic Richfield have developed encryption systems to scramble signals at the point of origin. S.B.S. claims its system is so secure that only a government would have the resources to crack it. **********Finally, there is that nagging question of what one loses when face-to-face meetings are replaced with electronics. Teleconferences can be ''beneficial for meetings within the company, where you already know the person and can pick up subtle cues such as body language that don't come over the phone,'' says Robert Alden of Strategic Planning Associates, a Washington-based business consulting firm. However, he adds, ''A lot of business decisions are based on instinct, on gut reactions'' and depend on nuances such as the firmness of a handshake. The teleconference that can convey the firmness of a handshake has yet to be invented.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Laurence Bergreen is the author of ''Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise of Network Broadcasting.'' A NEW VENTURE FORWNET **********One unexpected contender in the bustling new business of selling teleconference services is New York's public broadcasting station, WNET. **********It wasn't the entrepreneurial spirit, or a leading edge in technology that spurred them on. It was the threat of budget cuts.  WNET had the equipment in place, and underutilized personnel as well. What it needed badly was added income, so this year it went after it. **********One of its first customers was General Mills, the Minneapolis-based food processing concern, which paid an estimated $60,000 for the full teleconference treatment featuring satellite linkup to 18 sites around the country. (WNET stresses that the cost per person comes down as the number of sites increases. For example, an additional site for General Mills would have added but $600 to the tab.) **********At the General Mills teleconference in May, moderator Kathleen Campion, a WNET correspondent, broke the ice by introducing H.  Brewster Atwater Jr., the chairman of the board, who in turn yielded the spotlight to pollster Louis Harris, who described the findings of a new survey comparing men's and women's attitudes toward working.(The company had commissioned the survey as part of a public information effort known as the General Mills American Family Report.) Questions from hookups in Boston, Seattle, Salt Lake City and Denver were fielded by the ''stars.'' **********Sound booms, television cameras, kleig lights and, on some oncamera figures, makeup, contributed a distinctively theatrical aura to the occasion. In fact, business seemed to take a back seat to the media event. What color shirt shows best on television? How does one gracefully read a speech from a Teleprompter? Most importantly how does one communicate credibly with an unseen audience? Chief executives might begin by studying the technique of a current master of the small screen, Ronald Reagan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/18/business/maine-central-acquired.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MAINE CENTRAL ACQUIRED", "print_headline": "MAINE CENTRAL ACQUIRED", "body_text": " **********Timothy Mellon, a member of the Mellon banking family of Pittsburgh, has completed his acquisition of the Maine Central Railroad at an undisclosed price.

Born in the Spindletop gusher of 1901 and financed by the Mellon fortune, Gulf went on to successfully challenge the Rockefeller oil empire. In dizzying succession, it opened the world's first gasoline filling station, acquired oceans of oil beneath the deserts of the Middle East and the swamps of Venezuela, and firmly established itself as one of the leading producers, refiners and purveyors of black gold. **********Gulf is now the seventh-largest oil company in the world, the seventh-biggest company in America and a member of the planet's most exclusive business sorority - the Seven Sisters of international oil. On a warm summer evening, the orange light emanating from the crown of the company's headquarters tower in downtown Pittsburgh seems to suggest power, confidence and even a trace of deserved smugness. **********Appearances, however, can be deceiving. Over the last half decade, Gulf has been hammered by a political payoff scandal, a battery of lawsuits, the loss of most of its prized foreign oil, declines in domestic output, a ludicrously disadvantageous natural gas sales contract and a devastating change in energy policy by the Government in Canada, where Gulf has vast holdings. Perhaps most painful, however, has been the combination of sharply reduced consumer demand and an overabundance of refining capacity, an industrywide affliction that is stinging Gulf particularly. **********''Gulf is a company going through a shrinking phase,'' Sal Ilacqua, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg & Towbin, says.  ''Gulf has no real turn-ons,'' Robert LeVine of E.F. Hutton, adds. ''Everytime they straighten out their business, something happens and they get hurt,'' Constantine Fliakos of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, says.  The upshot is that Wall Street seems agreed that Gulf will not be able to match its 1980 earnings of $6.70 a share (excluding a 51-cent gain from the sale of stock in the company's Canadian unit). The price of Gulf stock has plunged by 35 percent in less than year, and some oil experts are beginning to ask an ominous question: Is Gulf - whose revenues last year totaled $28.8 billion - a company on the ropes? **********''I would reject that question out of hand - vociferously, vigorously, every way I could,'' snaps Jerry McAfee, the folksy, 64-year-old chairman of the board. Readily admitting Gulf has faced, and indeed still faces, big problems, Mr. McAfee contends that the worst is behind, and things are on the uptick. **********Gulf, like other oil companies, is representative of a fundamental paradox. Control of foreign oil has slipped away, production from United States oilfields is falling and the market for petroleum products is eroding. Yet, in the face of what would be a nightmare for almost any other business, things have seldom been rosier. The reason is a sixteenfold increase in the price of oil over the last decade. Sales, profits and assets have soared, as oil companies have directly benefited from the aggressive pricing of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. As is often true in architecture, less is more. **********''Adversity sometimes leads to strength,'' Mr. McAfee said, voicing a confidence that has characterized Gulf since its first president, James Guffey, dazzled turn-of-the-century Texas society with his big black hat, stovepipe trousers and loud waistcoats. **********The company, more geared to light, low-sulfur crude than any other major, is now spending $500 million to upgrade refineries to handle the heavier, more sulfurous crude oil increasingly prevalent these days. It acquired 700,000 exploratory acres last year, bringing its total inventory to more than 13 million. Through two acquisitions earlier this year it increased its coal producing capacity by 50 percent. And it has begun an ambitious program to sharpen its refining and marketing operations. **********In addition, Gulf is in excellent financial position with nearly $2 billion of cash on hand, a Triple-A credit rating, one of the lowest debt-to-equity positions in the industry and a $4 billion capital budget in 1981. Accordingly, the company argues that, after years of floundering, it is now firmly on the right track. **********''We are now paying the price for some wrong decisions taken 10 years ago,'' Mr. McAfee said, wincing as he recalled Gulf's failure, at a time when he was not in the head office, to establish a prominent exploration position in Alaska, America's richest petroleum province. ''We are now if the period of time lag between putting forth additional efforts and tasting the fruits of them.'' **********Perhaps. But analysts have criticized the company for a lack of crispness in corporate decision-making, citing what they call a start-and-stop development of its huge Mount Taylor uranium prospect in New Mexico. **********Further, Gulf's success hinges on the turn of events in the turbulent entrepreneurial arena of energy, where changes in consumer demand, catastrophes in far corners of the globe and decisions by governments can alter the landscape overnight. **********I N Gulf's case, worldwide oil production has plunged 80 percent over the past decade, even as assets have nearly doubled and profits have increased by 150 percent. This constricting character of the basic business is evident from the following facts: *********** Both Venezuela and Kuwait nationalized Gulf's holdings in December 1975. Largely because of these actions, Gulf has dropped to fifth position among worldwide crude producers, from second place in 1970. *********** The loss of ready oil has been accelerated further as OPEC countries have cut major oil companies' share of the world's oil, in order to market it themselves. Last year, Gulf lost more than 500,000 barrels a day of long-term crude purchases, primarily from Kuwait, Venezuela and Nigeria. *********** Domestic crude production has been on the decline. Last year it totaled 364,200 barrels a day, down from 425,500 in 1975 and 626,000 in 1970. *********** Gulf has cut daily worldwide refining capacity to 1.6 million barrels, from about two million five years ago. *********** Once reputed to be one of the world's pre-eminent oil traders, Gulf's trading and transportation division last year handled just 806,000 barrels of crude, nearly 50 percent below 1979. This marks a continuation of a trend that has seen a cut in the number of tankers Gulf owns, leases and charters to 53, from 75 in 1976, from 99 in 1970. **********Does all this mean Gulf is slipping into a different category from the Exxon Corporation, the Mobil Corporation, Texaco Inc. and others of the Seven Sisters? **********''We haven't been your typical sorority member,'' Mr. McAfee conceded. Gulf has the particular disadvantage of never having had access to Saudi Arabia's huge crude supplies -at $32 a barrel the cheapest crude oil available in the world. In what turned out to be the company's biggest mistake ever, 50 years ago, Gulf spurned an offer to enter the desert kingdom as one of its first petroleum producers. **********Today analysts are hard pressed to define Gulf in traditional industry terms. The company has deliberately retrenched into North America, but the its wealth and continuing foreign interests argue for continuing to classify it as an international. ''Gulf isn't really a major or a minor,'' Mr. Ilacqua, of L.F. Rothschild, said. **********What will it be? ''It is really a question of what senior management wants to do,'' Charles C. Cahn, of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, observed. **********More than other major oil companies, Gulf has traditionally preferred to grab the bulk of its profits from finding and producing oil. Just 10 years ago, the company had considerably more crude than it could refine and market itself, and was in the enviable position of peddling its surplus. **********But now, not only is worldwide production slashed, but also, analysts think, there is little likelihood that Gulf will be able to halt the steady decline in its United States reserves. **********''They just don't seem to be in the sweet spots,'' Mr. Levine of E.F. Hutton, said. Mr. Cahn characterized the company's exploration acreage as ''riskier'' and ''just not as exciting'' as that held by other major companies. **********Another often-cited trap is a 1964 natural gas sales contract under which Gulf must sell 24 percent of its gas for 19 to 22 cents a thousand cubic feet to the Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, substantially below its average price of $1.71. **********Mr. McAfee points out that the contract ends in 1986, and early renegotiation is likely. ''It is in the interests of Texas Eastern to renegotiate now in order to have access to significant additional gas at the end of this contract,'' he said. **********Mr. McAfee acknowledges Gulf's problems, but is, typically, optimistic. ''Although flattening out the decline in domestic production is proving to be frustratingly difficult, it is a challenge we must overcome,'' he told analysts last December. In particular, Gulf feels there is considerable promise in the Overthrust Belt of the Rocky Mountains, the Gulf of Mexico and a bevy of other areas so secretive that Mr. McAfee does not discuss them. **********Domestically, then, the company is counting on loads of serendipity laced with the latest in geophysics and petroleum engineering and a tough bargaining postion. **********Worldwide, Gulf's problem is akin to trying to compete in the lemonade business if your biggest competitors can buy lemons for a dime when you have to pay 15 cents. Further, people are drinking less all the time and you have to slash prices to sell any at all. **********A money-losing proposition? Of course. Exxon, Mobil, Texaco and the Standard Oil Company of California -the four biggest oil companies in the United States - buy the bulk of their crude oil from Saudi Arabia at just $32 a barrel. Gulf gets the majority of its foreign crude from West Africa at $40 a barrel. And, given an inability to pass on these full costs in today's highly competitive environment, it loses $3.50 or more on each barrel of Nigerian oil it refines. **********Largely because of this, Gulf lost $197 million from United States refining and marketing operations in the first quarter, versus a profit of $142 million in the first quarter of 1980. **********Gulf's strategy for dealing with the squeeze is first to reduce the amount of oil its buys from Nigeria to the lowest level permitted under its contracts, and second, to press hard to convince Nigeria to lower its price. Oil experts seem to agree that African petroleum prices are on their way down. ''It's got to come down from where it is now,'' John H. Lichtblau of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said. **********Additionally, Gulf is cutting its refining capacity. Worldwide, capacity has fallen 20 percent in five years, and domesticly it has been cut 8 percent with the closing of two refineries last year. **********For future crude supplies, Gulf is counting on an extrapolation of some existing trends. By 1985, it expects its daily output from Nigeria, the company's biggest source of crude, to increase by 50 percent from last year's 112,000 barrels a day, and North Sea daily output is expected to double by 1984 from this year's 35,000 barrels. **********The big question mark in terms of exploration and production is Canada, where price controls hamper profit potential and - more important - a new energy policy is making it very difficult for American companies to operate, partly by giving Canadian-owned companies financial incentives to explore in treacherous frontier areas that are not available to American companies. Gulf, which has major interests in two of Canada's hottest frontier plays, Hibernia and the Beaufort Sea, acknowledges that it has looked into a variety of ways to increase Canadian ownership. **********M R. McAFEE noted that Gulf would be eligible for the frontier incentives if it ''farms out'' a majority portion of its ownership to Canadian-owned companies, in return for those Canadian companies picking up the check for drilling the well. Because of the big expense of drilling in difficult offshore areas, Gulf would have farmed out much of its acreage in any case, he says. **********''Canada is still a good pdace to do business,'' Mr. McAfee said.  ''We'll be there for a long time.'' In a decade, Mr. McAfee thinks that Gulf ''will not look significantly different than it does right now.'' The company's focus will still be on energy, principally United States exploration and production of oil and gas. **********Capital, Mr. McAfee says, is the company's major, almost unquenchable need, despite its current large pool of cash. Both Gulf and Gulf Canada will soon have to go to the debt market, he says, and the company is cutting back expenditures for projects with an uncertain payout - among others, most synthetic fuels projects. **********Does this mean Gulf is sacrificing its future for a comfortable present? ''It is a great temptation to put everything we've got into the immediate, short-term quick payoff items,'' Mr. McAfee said.  Nonetheless, Gulf continues to be heavily involved in the Rio Blanco shale oil project in western Colorado, in partnership with the Standard Oil Company (Indiana). **********Over the short term, analysts are watching closely to see if Gulf will pull back more - close another big refinery, for example, or abandon more markets. (Since 1970, Gulf has shut down 20,000 stations, 14,450 of them in the United States.) **********Then, there is the question of succession. Mr. McAfee is scheduled to retire Nov. 30, and while no one at the company will speculate on who will take over, a home-grown talent is conceded to be the likely choice. Top contenders certainly include James E. Lee, president, Harold H. Hammer, executive vice president, and Edward B. Walker, also an executive vice president. **********Intriguingly, Mr. McAfee said that Gulf is ''seriously considering'' buying a block of its own stock, something the company did in 1973 when it bought back $341 million worth. This would tend to bolster the stock price by increasing earnings per share, a key determinant of share prices. **********But such a move would also represent a deliberate shrinking back of the size of the company, almost an admission that shareholders might find a better way to spend the money than Gulf itself could. Such steps are unusual for large growing companies. Like emperors, most have developed a taste for growing ever larger.   GULF'SSAD CHAPTER **********PITTSBURGH Five years ago, Gulf directors, each with a lawyer by his side, huddled in Pittsburgh to deal with one of the biggest corporate scandals ever. At issue was Gulf's secret, and illegal, generosity to a host of powerful politiciansof both parties over a 15-year period. High-living capital lobbyists, a mysterious Gulf subsidiary in the Bahamas and suspicious gifts to the Nixon White House were all involved. The net result was the removal of chairman Bob Dorsey and three other top executives. **********''When you assume the law of the land is your enemy, you're in trouble,'' said Sister Jane Scully, president of Carlow College, who was brought on to Gulf's board to help clean up the company's act. **********Jerry McAfee, the man who replaced Mr. Dorsey as Gulf's chairman, has devoted a great deal of his tenure to closing the book on that chapter. ''I had to spend whatever time was required to get those things properly behind us,'' he said. Those who watch the company think he has done quite a job. **********''The prime purpose of McAfee was to change the image of the company from one guilty of a crime to a decent corporate citizen,'' Charles C. Cahn, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said. ''He has done a good job.'' **********Today, Mr. McAfee is able to boast that Gulf, as a corporation, makes no campaign contributions and does not even maintain a political action committee. Instead, he says, the company is contributing expertise, partly through his personal contacts with all three Energy Secretaries who have held the office. ''It is possible to participate effectively in the governmental process by making contributions of other things than money,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/08/business/purchasers-cite-mixed-prices.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Purchasers Cite Mixed Prices", "print_headline": "Purchasers Cite Mixed Prices", "body_text": " **********Selected metals, chemic als and paper products were higher in price in August, a ccording to a survey of 225 industrial company purchasing managers.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader. **********Geneina lies on the indistinct border between the Sudan, a pro-Western bulwark protecting Egypt's southern flank, and Chad, a country that the Soviet-supported Colonel Qaddafi all but annexed 10 months ago. Nomads Know No Boundaries **********This region is known as Darfur, an area the size of France that was once a proud, independent sultanate run by a dynasty of rulers that lasted 560 years. From Geneina, caravans of pilgrims heading overland to Mecca make their way east. Men of the Tuareg stock of desert nomads roam the area, dressed in long white robes and white turbans.  With their camels and mules and trappings they recognize no international boundaries, lines that appear on the maps but not on the shifting sands and dry river beds they traverse. The town itself is one of flat-roofed houses, stretched resources and economic decay. **********Casualties Are Modest **********The war is ostensibly between the Sudan and Libya. Libyan aircraft bombed border villages near here 25 times between Sept. 10 and Oct.  13. It is a token of the low level of the fighting that, among the most severe casualties listed by the Sudan were 7 goats, 44 cows and 3 camels. **********The raids hit villages, including one called Kulbus, 75 miles north of here. The official Sudanese position is that the village is just one more of the small settlements that lie on the border. Other authoritative informants, however, say that Kulbus is the general headquarters of a Chadian insurgent group, numbering about 2,500 men led by Hissen Habre, Chad's former Defense Minister, who opposes the Libyan presence in his country. The raids, these informants maintain, were intended to destabilize the insurgent leader's rear base and turn the local Sudanese population against him and his mentor, President Gaafar al-Nimeiry of the Sudan. **********Earlier this month, General Nimeiry, seeking to dramatize his plight, depicted this border confict as the forerunner of a Libyan invasion. He siad it was part of a wider assault on the West's allies in the Middle East at a time of vulnerability after the assassination of his ally, Anwar el-Sadat, in Egypt. **********Sudanese Army officers here say such an invasion is physically possible but unlikely at present. The terrain, they say, would be suitable for a push by Libya's Soviet-built T-54 tanks, but the supply lines would be overextended and the logistics difficult. For reporters who drove here from El Fasher, 220 miles to the east, the trip took 13 hours across deep sand, indistinct tracks, dry river beds and rocky mountain passes where locusts swarmed from thorn trees, water was scarce and fuel yet scarcer. How It Began **********The border conflict started last December when Libyan troops moved into Chad to support Goukouni Oueddei, the Prime Minister, against Mr. Habre, who fled to the Sudan. It remains a conflict involving allies of convenience rather than conviction. **********Colonel Qaddafi supported Mr. Habre in an earlier insurrection in Chad. Now Colonel Qaddafi is backing Mr. Goukouni, and Mr. Habre needs a new protector. Both the Sudan and Egypt require a means of harassing the Libyans in Chad, so the former friend of their enemy, has become their ally. **********Tony Brauman, a French volunteer doctor who has become a confidant of Mr. Habre in Kulbus, said the insurgents there were equipped with new Egyptian-supplied weapons, incuding antiaircraft guns and assault rifles of both Eastern and Western design. Egyptian military advisers have been seen in Kulbus, Mr. Brauman said. According to other informants, four Egyptian transport aircraft landed recently at El Fasher with fresh supplies. The insurgents led by Mr. Habre have penetrated 70 to 130 miles into Chad but do not hold any towns. **********Brig. Abbas Mohamed Abulaal, the Sudanese commander here, who describes his area of authority as ''the western frontier,'' said Libyan troops and Chadian Government forces held a town just across the border in Chad. Fighting to Negotiate **********Mr. Habre does not believe he can win a straight military victory unless Colonel Qaddafi withdraws his men. ''They know they cannot win a military victory,'' Mr. Brauman said. ''They want to keep up pressure and then be able to negotiate. If they do not fight, they have no negotiating position.'' **********Several recent developments have heartened Mr. Habre's men. The Reagan Administration's hostility toward Colonel Qaddafi, an authoritative Sudanese source said, has encouraged a belief that Washington will support them indirectly through Egypt. When the Libyan bombing raids ceased 10 days ago, the source said, Mr. Habre's men attributed that to the presence of United States Awacs aircraft monitoring the border area. In this remote zone, travellers have noted, the Awacs have taken on a special aura, as if they provided an impenetrable defense line. **********For its part, Libya is conducting a war on several fronts, apparently in pursuance of Colonel Qaddafi's campaign to establish a line of anti-American governments from his borders through the Sudan to Marxist Ethiopia, Somalia and Southern Yemen. Colonel Qaddafi already has an alliance with Ethiopia and Southern Yemen, which is worrying the Sudan, and Sudanese officials assert that he wants to bring down President Nimeiry to isolate Egypt and thus combat the peace treaty with Israel. Bombs in Cigarettes **********Libyan broadcasts are beamed into this area, urging the people to turn against President Nimeiry, and the bombing raids, Sudanese officials say, are intended in part to make the Sudanese leader look weak in the eyes of his compatriots. At the same time, Libya has reportedly sent sabotage and assassination squads into this region. **********Brigadier Abbas recently showed reporters an attache case packed with cartons of Rothmans cigarettes and Courreges toilet water packed with plastic explosives. The box of toilet water, Brigadier Abbas said, was rigged to explode when it was opened. The explosives in the cigarette packets were connected to timing devices. ''This was an attempt to kill me,'' Brigadier Abbas said. ''But our security services intercepted the briefcase and arrested the Libyan agents carrying it.'' **********The Libyan campaign perceived by the Sudan extends further. In the deserts north of here, there are caravan trails where for centuries nomads have crossed the ocher wastes on camels, trading among their kinfolk between Darfur and what is now Libya. These days, young Sudanese go to work in Libya and return laden with Japanese hi-fi equipment, blue jeans, perfumes and Italian shirts. ''We are closer to Libya than we are to our own port on the Red Sea,'' a Sudanese official said. ''Our trade has traditionally been with Libya.'' Fugitives Are a Problem **********The Governor of the Darfur region, Ahmed Ibrahim Derreig, said: ''This is the dangerous thing. The Libyans can exploit the economic situation and tell the people their point of view without our Government telling our point of view.'' Radio Tripoli's broadcasts reach Geneina. Those of Radio Omdurman, the official Sudanese radio, do not. **********Yet a further destabilizing factor is the presence of Chadian fugitives here. There are 8,000 registered refugees in Geneina, most of them from the ferocious Guran tribe, whose men traditionally carry a dagger in a scabbard on the upper arm concealed in a flowing robe.  The refugees eat from aid supplies when the local people do not, relief workers say, and their presence taxes the town's resources, which are barely able to meet the demands of its 60,000 people. **********Mr. Habre's insurgents, too, have incurred some disfavor among Sudanese. French medical personnel working in Kulbus said the insurgents had been confined to their barracks after 6 P.M. because they had gotten drunk and had brawls with the local people and there had been killings. Reason for Attention **********This small conflict with its minutiae would have been largely unnoticed by the outside world had it not been for the assassination of President Sadat and the sudden focusing of Western attention on the Sudan as Egypt's geographically closest ally. The Reagan Administration has agreed to try to accelerate deliveries of military hardware to the Sudan, apparently as a gesture of psychological support. President Nimeiry, whose army of 60,000 is poorly equipped, encouraged these attentions. **********Now, Sudanese officials contend, the prospect of American military involvement on a larger scale has produced its own hazards. ''We do not want to have another Vietnam in Africa,'' Governor Derreig said.  ''If the big powers come and the conflict becomes bigger, our people will suffer not only during the war but afterward.'' **********External involvement here has its anomalies. Egypt and the Sudan, Washington's allies, have become embroiled with Mr. Habre's forces as part of their campaign against Libya, a fierce opponent of the Camp David accords. At the same time, however, France has begun supporting the Chad Government of Mr. Goukouni in Ndjamena. The Reagan Administration is supporting a French initiative to create an African peacekeeping force to replace the Libyans in Chad, something Colonel Qaddafi is resisting because of what he terms Sudanese aggression. Washington, thus, seems to be indirectly involved on both sides of a conflict that shows little sign now of easing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/business/auto-output-to-rise-42.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Auto Output To Rise 42%", "print_headline": "Auto Output To Rise 42%", "body_text": " **********United States auto makers plan to build 42 percent more cars this week than they did in the comparable week of 1980, but the number of workers on long-term layoff remains virtually unchanged from last week, according to industry reports released today. **********The industry journal Ward's Automotive Reports said that the five major domestic manufacturers scheduled production of 144,060 cars this week, up from 101,411 units during the 1980 week, but down 12 percent from the 164,388 cars made last week. **********Domestic truck production was scheduled to reach 35,445 units for the week, up 64 percent from the 21,587 trucks built during the same week last year, but down 11 percent from 39,823 units made last week, Ward's said. **********Meanwhile, the auto makers said they have 153,375 employees on long-term layoffs without a recall date, virtually unchanged from 153,400 last week.

Newsweek is down. Reader's Digest is down.  TV Guide is down. The New Yorker is down. Woman's Day is down.  Business Week is down. Cosmopolitan is down. Sports Illustrated is down. Such is the direction of first-quarter advertising pages for some of America's best-known and sturdiest magazines. **********From 1976 through 1979, it seemed that magazines could do nothing wrong. Ad pages climbed nearly 50 percent. Revenues doubled.  Then things abruptly leveled off last year. Ad pages were essentially flat; revenues rose a modest 8 percent. And the trend has not changed so far this year. **********Blaming the Economy **********Most magazine publishers blame tight ad budgets resulting from the skittish economy for most of their problems, though other factors - including increasing competition from other media - also seem to be gnawing away at business. **********''It's the toughest year I can recall since 1975,'' observed David O'Brasky, advertising director of New York magazine. In 1975, both ad pages and ad revenues of the magazine industry dived for the first time since 1970. **********Not all publications, however, are suffering: Town & Country, Money magazine and Architectural Digest are all doing well, to name a few.  And New York magazine increased its ad pages 19 percent in the first quarter of 1981, though most of that improvement could be ascribed to gains from the insertion of Cue magazine into New York. **********But most of the big names are suffering unwelcome erosions. A Flat 1981 Is Expected **********In the view of Robert Coen, a magazine forecaster at McCann-Erickson, ad pages for the entire industry will once again be flat for all of 1981 and ad revenues will climb only 8 to 10 percent, solely because of rate increases. He expects pages in the first half of the year to tumble by a few percent and then, if the economy rebounds, rise by a similar amount in the second half, a reversal of last year's pattern. **********Newsstand sales have also been soft for a good many magazines this year, and publishers are tending to deliver little bonus circulation above their rate bases. **********''It's clear that the first quarter was weaker than expected, and the second quarter, as far as we know it, looks like a continuation of that,'' said Kent Rhodes, head of the Magazine Publishers Association. ''Our upward curve has been stopped and we're treading water for a while.'' Moving Back to TV **********As Joe Ostrow, director of communications services at the big Young & Rubicam advertising agency, observed: ''For a lot of diverse reasons, people have become less enamored of magazines. I think there were a lot of people dragged kicking and screaming into magazines when TV rates went through the roof. Because television rate increases have softened a bit, I think the people who really want to be in TV have gone back.'' **********Mr. Ostrow adds, ''I think the key thing, if magazines are to grow again, is the effort of the industry to sell magazines in a meaningful way. I think they lost an opportunity, three or four years ago when all these people were pushed into magazines, to really solidify their sales.'' **********Taking a particularly severe thrashing are the women's service books. Of the so-called Seven Sisters - Good Housekeeping, The Ladies' Home Journal, McCall's, Family Circle, Woman's Day, Redbook and Better Homes and Gardens - only Good Housekeeping ran ahead of last year in first-quarter ad pages. **********''The most dramatic reason for our being down is cigarettes,'' said Peter Bonanni, publisher of Woman's Day, which carried 19 percent fewer ad pages in the first quarter. Big packaged goods are off, he adds, as are regional and new-product ads. **********Family Circle, a property of The New York Times Company, managed to lose fewer pages, but it chose not to raise rates this spring (as Woman's Day did) in order to keep the orders coming in. Reynolds and Seagram's Shift **********Two nettlesome factors for the women's books and the news weeklies were decisions reached late last year by R.J. Reynolds, the nation's No.1 cigarette maker, and Seagram's, the big liquor concern, to realign their media mix. **********Reynolds moved a good chunk of its magazine ads into newspapers, billboards and regional magazines, while Seagram's pulled pages out of the news weeklies in particular and put them into regional publications, some new magazines such as Discover and Inside Sports, and newspapers and outdoor advertising. **********Over at Newsweek, which found itself some 70 ad pages short of last year in the first quarter, the magazine calculates it will lose a total of about 100 pages this year from R.J. Reynolds and Seagram's. **********Why, in all this gloom, is Good Housekeeping up? ''It's probably one of the first choices on schedules and so it's a little less vulnerable than some of the others,'' noted Mr. Coen of McCann-Erickson. **********At Time Inc., which has six established magazines, Time, Sports Illustrated, People, Money, Fortune and Life, and the new entry, Discover, only Money ran ahead in first-quarter ad pages, according to Publishers Information Bureau numbers. ''We kind of thought the first quarter would be not too terrific,'' says Kelso Sutton, group vice president in charge of the Time Inc. magazines. ''I'm not sitting over here slitting my wrists.'' Business Magazines Slip **********All three heavyweights of the business magazine field, Business Week, Fortune and Forbes, have also been lagging. Business Week, which led the entire magazine pack in ad pages last year, fell 9 percent in the first quarter. The softness, according to Orlin Davis, the ad director, was in travel, industrial materials, liquor and media. **********Even in these penny-pinching times, however, most of the slick women's fashion magazines are ahead. Hearst's Harper's Bazaar, for instance, posted a 23 percent rise in first-quarter ad pages. **********''Women are still buying the fashion categories - apparel, cosmetics,'' remarked Gilbert C. Maurer, president of Hearst Magazines. ''I think you can make a case that the up-scale, up-market magazines have been affected less than the middle-market magazines.  The ad staff at Harper's Bazaar wouldn't have any inkling that there's a recession.'' **********Few magazines have gone out of business this year, though a number of them are reportedly teetering and Triangle Publications' lavish Panorama magazine about the television industry will close with the June issue because of skimpy circulation. And fewer new magazines are planned by publishers. **********But, one magazine official noted, ''I think you could see some well-known magazines go down the tubes this year that are going to really surprise some people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/18/business/advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 15, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Pollio Dairy Products Corporation to Levine, Huntley, Schmidt, Plapler and Beaver Inc."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/02/business/oil-production-down-in-china.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oil Production Down in China", "print_headline": "Oil Production Down in China", "body_text": " **********China's production of oil and natural gas declined in 1980, the official New China News Agency said yesterday.

And hardly anyone cared enough even to snicker when the exchange tried and failed to establish futures markets in turkeys, potatoes and frozen eggs. **********But now this city's second futures exchange, bidding to become the premier trading house for financial instruments, has upset the competition with the success of its three-month-old certificate of deposit contract. **********And the Merc is preparing a spirited challenge to its rivals for dominance in the proposed Eurodollar contracts, which promise to become one of the hottest ever. Further clashes are likely also over the trading of stock index futures, if they are instituted, and over affiliations with foreign futures exchanges. **********The competition is fierce, and most analysts say it is too early to predict a winner. ''The game is changing very rapidly and either exchange may come up with a product that could build its volume,'' said Arthur Hahn, president of Rouse Woodstock, a commodities firm that trades on both exchanges. **********But many believe that the Merc's mix of short-term contracts and its international reputation put it in a good position to compete over the next few months. **********''I wouldn't underestimate the mutuality of interest that the Merc has already established around the world with its gold futures and currency contracts,'' said Patrick S. Collins, a vice president at the First Boston Corporation. ''You might have the Board of Trade going to foreign exchanges saying 'we're the greatest corn market in the world.' In Hong Kong that could produce a big yawn.'' **********Relations between the two exchanges have not always been so intensely competitive. In fact, they have coexisted for decades seeming perfectly content to divide the commodity contracts between their two floors. Crops, such as corn, soybeans and wheat, became the staple of the Board of Trade, while meat - hogs and cattle - was emphasized at the Merc. **********They stayed out of each other's way even in the early days of financial futures. The Merc got a head start by establishing in the early 1970's a division called the International Monetary Market to trade currencies. The Board of Trade later developed Treasury-bond contracts and silver futures contracts that propelled it ahead of the Merc. **********When interest rate futures came into vogue a few years later the two also stayed out of each other's way. The Board of Trade concentrated on long-term Treasury bonds, while the Merc focused on 90-day Treasury bills. Confrontation With C.D.'s **********But the stage was set for confrontation last summer when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, after a two-year moratorium on new futures contracts, granted exchanges the right to trade threemonth certificates of deposit, **********Certificate of deposit futures contracts, traded in $1 million denominations, are popular among bankers. Banks issue certificates of deposit to raise lendable funds. Using the futures market helps protect them from wild swings in interest rates by locking up a fixed rate in advance. Speculators try to earn a profit in the market by correctly anticipating rate changes. **********Trading in certificates of deposit began early in July on the New York Futures Exchange, followed two weeks later by the Board of Trade and then by the Merc at the end of that month. The Merc, maintaining that as a general rule a given contract will be successful on only one exchange, is claiming victory over the early birds. **********''The last two or three weeks have indicated clearly that the liquidity is coming our way,'' said Leo Melamed, a special counsel to the Merc who masterminded that exchange's move into financial futures. ''Our C.D. contract has become acceptable to the majority of users and once that happens you need an act of God to change directions.'' **********Last week, according to Mercantile Exchange figures, more than 75 percent of the 43,700 certificate of deposit contracts that changed hands were traded on the Merc. The reason for the great imbalance, experts say, is that traders have been able to ''spread,'' or arbitrage, their trades against the 90-day Treasury bills, which are traded on the Merc also. **********Spreading is used almost solely by professional traders who watch closely the relative prices between different contracts. If, for example, the price gap between certificates of deposit and Treasury bills is unusually wide, a trader may sell certificates of deposit and buy Treasury bills. If he is correct, the gain on one contract will be greater than the loss on the other. **********''With a new contract the user's main concern is can he get out easily; that's the big question,'' Mr. Melamed said. ''We had the 90-day T-bill contract. So when you're in trouble and can't sell C.D.'s, you can sell T-bills and cover 80 percent of your exposure.  The Tbills provided us with an emergency exit.'' **********Because the Eurodollar contract would possess characteristics similar to those of the other short-term instruments that are trading successfully at the Merc, that exchange is predicting that it will handle most of the volume when the contract begins trading in December or early next year. Eurodollars are dollars held and circulated by overseas banks. Merc Restructuring Floor **********The Merc is so confident of success that it is rebuilding its exchange floor to accommodate increased futures trading. It will move the Treasury bill pit out of a corner and into the center of the room, near new Eurodollar and certificate of deposit pits. It has begun an aggressive program to educate its members in trading and arbitrage possibilities with Eurodollar contracts. **********In fact the Merc is already promoting itself as the world's largest futures exchange, based on the number of contracts listed. It has 13, the Board of Trade, five. But other yardsticks show that the distinction is still up for grabs. **********In the first six months of this year, the latest period for which comparable data are available, the volume at the Board of Trade in financial futures stood at 7.1 million contracts, compared with 6.4 million at the Merc. Volume for the Board of Trade's Treasury bond contract generally exceeds 60,000 contracts a day, making it the most successful financial futures contract ever. **********Full membership on the Board of Trade cost the last purchaser $235,000, $10,000 more than the latest price for a seat on the Merc.  But a partial membership, permitting the holder to trade financial futures only, last sold for $200,000 on the Merc, $40,000 more than the last transaction for similar privileges at the Board of Trade.  Last year total revenue for the Merc totaled $26.4 million, while the Board of Trade reported gross receipts of $29.6 million. 'Stop-the-Merc Movement' **********To meet these challenges, the Board of Trade and the struggling New York Futures Exchange (a subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange) have reached an affiliation agreement, pending approval by the membership, that many futures experts interpret as a ''stop-the-Merc movement.'' By pooling their listed contracts the two exchanges hope to come up with the arbitrage combinations that have worked so well for the Merc. **********''The competition has shifted from New York versus Chicago to Chicago versus Chicago. There is no competition in New York,'' Leslie Rosenthal, chairman of the Board of Trade, told his membership and the press last week, adding, ''If we didn't make this type of association the future would be settled for us.'' **********Nevertheless, the agreement has sown discord among the Board of Trade's members, some of whom believe that the New York exchange should be allowed to die. Responding to these complaints, the directors of the Board of Trade decided on Monday to appoint a panel to study the agreement and to submit the matter to a membership vote next month. **********To prevent the Merc from overtaking it, the Board of Trade is trying to increase its affiliations, making overtures to fledgling futures exchanges in London and Hong Kong. It hopes that the tie-in with the New York Futures Exchange, if it is sustained by the membership, will help it establish the dominant contract in futures on stock indexes, which would allow futures traders to buy or sell a basket of securities based on the New York Stock Exchange's proprietary average."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/15/world/us-and-japanese-are-urged-to-share-more-responsibility.html": {"writer_name": "Emerson Chapin", "pub_date": "1981-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 519, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. AND JAPANESE ARE URGED TO SHARE MORE RESPONSIBILITY", "print_headline": "U.S. AND JAPANESE ARE URGED TO SHARE MORE RESPONSIBILITY", "body_text": " **********The Japanese-American relationship has been mutually beneficial in recent years but should be readjusted if it is to function most effectively in future, Graham Allison, dean of Harvard's John F.

Like the money funds, however, some of the new instruments do pay higher interest rates and provide greater liquidity than traditional savings vehicles: passbook accounts or certificates of deposit. **********And some may be particularly intriguing if interest rates turn down, since they allow the investor to lock in an interest rate for a period of time, but still provide the freedom to pull funds out. **********Some banks are working to make the six-month certificate of deposit a more flexible investment. In a traditional C.D., the investor is penalized for withdrawing money before the certificate matures. But under Citibank's Easy Access C.D., for example, an investor can withdraw all but $3,000 of the investment, allowing reinvestment at higher interest rates if rates are rising. **********Several bank holding companies, including Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover and Continental Illinois are about to begin to issue seven-year notes at rates that fluctuate weekly with average commercial paper rates. The interest will be paid on a monthly basis. To redeem their funds, however, investors will have to sell the notes or wait until they mature. **********Another new alternative is a consumer version of an investment long available to wealthy investors: the repurchase agreement, or ''repo.'' For a minimum investment of $1,000, the consumer can earn a return at an annual rate of 15 percent for up to 12 weeks. **********That rate remains in effect for the life of the investment, even if interest rates head down. But if rates go up and there are better investments elsewhere, the money can be withdrawn any time after an initial period of about eight or 10 days - the details vary from bank to bank. The banks may also set new rates, but they would not affect repos already in existence. **********Only a few savings banks and savings associations in the New York area now offer such plans, and they all call them by different names. At the American Savings Bank (and its Franklin and Empire Savings Bank divisions), which has had the program the longest, it is called the Investment Certificate. The County Federal Savings and Loan Association of Rockville Centre, L.I., introduced such a plan, called the Investors Fund, in mid-May. At the West Side Savings and Loan Association, the program, which began last Wednesday, is called the Growth Fund. **********But, predicts John L. Reilly, senior vice president and secretary at the American Savings Bank, ''over the next few months, this plan is going to proliferate.'' **********The investment is actually in the form of a ''loan'' to the bank.  The bank puts up Government securities as collateral that it will repay the loan. The loan itself, however, is not guaranteed by the Government. **********The repo procedure is widely used by both bankers and brokerage firms. In a typical repo, an investor buys Government securities from a bank, with the promise that the bank will buy back the securities and also pay for the use of the money. Hundreds of millions of dollars of repos change hands daily. But until recently, the repo was unavailable to the small investor. Scattered banking institutions around the country have begun to offer these retail repos in recent months. **********Under American's plan, money must remain for at least eight days.  The maximum term is 84 days, or 12 weeks, and the 15 percent interest rate is guaranteed for that period. If an investor wants to withdraw funds before 84 days, they must be completely withdrawn, and there is a $3 service fee. However, if there is at least $1,000 remaining, a new Investment Certificate could be purchased. **********From time to time, the bank may change the rate available on new certificates, although that would not affect certificates already outstanding. The rate has been changed three times in the five months the certificates have been available. **********Details of similar programs vary from bank to bank. At County Federal, the minimum investment is also $1,000, but the full term runs 89 days rather than 84, and money must remain for 10 days rather than eight. There is no charge for withdrawing money after 10 days.  When the 89 days are up, the money is transferred automatically into either a daily passbook account or a NOW - negotiable order of withdrawal - account that must be set up when money is placed in the Investors Fund. An investor may also immediately withdraw the funds on the final day. **********At West Side Federal, the Growth Fund also calls for a $1,000 minimum investment and funds must stay at the bank for at least 10 days up to a maximum of 89 days. The savings and loan association also requires investors to open either a passbook account, with a $10 minimum deposit, or a NOW checking account, with a $500 minimum - the minimum deposit levels are scheduled to change on July 1. George Hottum, a vice president at West Side Federal, said that the Growth Fund was a limited offering and could be withdrawn at any time."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/jobs/the-marketplace-in-four-major-fields-engineering.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1981-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1012, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Job Market", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETPLACE IN FOUR MAJOR FIELDS ENGINEERING", "print_headline": "THE MARKETPLACE IN FOUR MAJOR FIELDS ENGINEERING", "body_text": " **********S OME say the inevitable downturn in the cyclical demand for engineers may begin soon. Others say there is no sign of it. However, by all accounts, the estimated 60,000 engineering graduates who entered the job market in the last year have benefited from a clear gap between supply and demand, and next year's crop is likely to do just as well. **********Just ask John Herb, who handles colleg e recruiting for the Pacific Gas & Electri c Company in San Francisco. ''From what I have seen,'' Mr. Herb said , ''your typical engineer with a 3.0 grade point averageand one summe r of work experience has at least three offers, and probably five or six. We had one guy in for an interview who had 17.'' **********Or Willard Greenwald, a 1980 graduate of the University of Vermont now employed as a mechanical engineer at Stanley Tools in South Shaftsbury, Vt. ''There were so many interviews on campus that I didn't even have to mail out resumes,'' he said. **********Or Robin Greenlief, a June graduate of Oregon State University now employed as a civil engineer in the power group at Bechtel Corporation in San Francisco. She is one of the rapidly growing group of women entering the profession. ''I had 10 interviews and 10 offers,'' she said. **********These experiences jibe with the results of a survey by the College Placement Council of Bethlehem, Pa., which found that engineering students, who made up about 7 percent of last year's graduates, received about 65 percent of the reported job offers. **********They also are borne out by the Endicott Report, an annual survey by Frank Endicott, the recently retired director of placement at Northwestern University, of hiring at large companies. Some 93 responding companies, which spent an average of $3.5 million on new engineers, said last December that they would hire 8,872 engineers, a increase in the per-company average of 14.4 percent from the previous year. A follow-up survey in May indicated that actual hiring was almost 5 percent greater than predicted. **********All this explains why George Thoms, manager of placement for Allied Chemical Company, the largest recruiter of engineers within the Allied Corporation, found competition for the graduates keener than ever. Allied interviewed more than 1,000 candidates at 75 colleges, Mr. Thoms said, for 72 technical positions. **********The strong demand translates into attractive starting salaries.  Most surveys show new engineers with Bachelor of Science degrees earn an average of between $22,000 and $23,000. Those with a Master of Science degree start at $25,000 or more. Civil engineers may be a little lower and specialties, such as electrical engineering, higher. **********The strong demand also enables new engineers to consider more than money in choosing prospective employers. ''I was looking at training programs,'' Mr. Greenwald said. ''I wanted one that would be fairly formal and give me the most practical knowledge about manufacturing.'' **********Still, some flexibility may be required. Thomas Krieger, a classmate of Mr. Greenwald's, wanted a job in the Burlington area, where the University of Vermont is situated. Eventually, he widened his search and, in May, took an offer to work in Allied's specialty chemicals division in Baton Rouge, La. ''There isn't much demand in northern New England because there is so little industry, but I see jobs galore advertised in the paper down here,'' he said. **********History indicates that the imbalance in supply and demand is bound to end. Some, like Robert N. Mills, manager of professional recruiting and university relations at the General Electric Company, believe it will persist throughout the decade. ''What is different from any time in the past 25 years is that we also have a high attrition rate now because the generation that was hired at the end of World War II is beginning to retire,'' he said. **********But others, like Harrison Shull, provost at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and chairman of the National Academy of Sciences' Commission on Human Resources, say the swing to oversupply could come in two or three years. **********''I've been watching freshman enrollments,'' he said. ''Last year's class was 110,000. If they finish at the same rate they have been during the past 10 years - more than 70 percent - we would see 75,000 of them entering the job market. Glut is too big a word for it, but there would be a modest surplus in supply.'' **********A softening of demand would not be felt evenly. Engineers in rapidly growing areas, such as computers and petroleum engineering, are likely to remain in short supply, as are those in unp opular niches, such as nuclear engineering, accordin g to most experts. **********Experts say that one healthy sign that the gap between supply and demand has narrowed would be a rise in the numbers of engineers going on for higher degrees to enhance their appeal to employers. As things stand, even well-known schools like the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute are having trouble attracting Ph.D. candidates. **********More advanced degree candidates and fewer job opportunities in industry might also replenish the ranks of teaching engineers. In recent years, industry has been offering engineers fresh out of undergraduate programs salaries 10 percent above those paid to junior faculty members with Ph.D. degrees. **********One large u nknown is whether the career-development opportunities of engineers entering the work force today will be limited simply because there are so many of them. The narrow passageway into management wi ll certainly not be easier to negotiate in a crowd. **********Few persons have adopted the long-range view of Brian Sedar, an architectural-engineering student who went on to get a master's degree in business administration at the University of Colorado before looking for work last summer. ''I ended up selling myself as an engineer because the recruiting was so much heavier,'' said Mr.  Sedar, now in Bechtel's petroleum group. ''But I want to get into management eventually and I expect the business degree to help.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/business/economic-scene-the-challenge-facing-reagan.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1981-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; The Challenge Facing Reagan", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; The Challenge Facing Reagan", "body_text": " **********THE biggest mistake President Reagan made at his news conference this week appears to have been his attack on House Speaker Thomas P.  O'Neill Jr., whom he accused of ''sheer demogoguery'' for criticizing his economic program as too generous to the wealthy and too hard on working people and the poor. ''I'm trying to find out something about his boyhood,'' the President said, ''because we didn't live on the wrong side of the railroad tracks, but we lived so close to them we could hear the whistle real loud.'' **********Mr. Reagan's attack on Mr. O'Neill appears to have backfired by rallying the Democrats not only to the support of their Congressional leader but also of a budget and tax package of their own design. The President hastened to try to patch things up, but the Democrats would have none of it. **********They apparently sensed that Mr. Reagan was highly sensitive to the charge that he had fashioned a program designed to serve the rich and sought to refute it by declaring, ''I grew up in poverty and got what education I got all by myself and so forth.'' **********Mr. O'Neill quickly turned this Presidential maneuver to his own advantage by remarking, ''I still live in the same neighborhood I did as a young boy,'' a pointed reference to the President's more recent affluent surroundings and friends. The Massachusetts Democrat does indeed live in the same old house in North Cambridge, near Porter Square, where he grew up - a working-class neighborhood. Mr. O'Neill followed up this left jab with a right cross for a hard-hitting combination. ''The issue,'' he said, ''is the programs he's been sending to the Congress. These are all geared to the wealthy of America.'' **********The President had sought to block that charge at his news conference by saying that ''we're going to do our utmost to keep the bottom rung of the ladder clear for those people that haven't yet started to climb.'' What those words were intended to convey was the now familiar supply-side message that tax cuts aimed at increasing incentives to save, invest and produce, and the deregulation of business would benefit the working poor more than Government programs or tax cuts aimed directly at them. **********But the conservative political faith, despite its current ascendancy, has a hard row to hoe in democratic societies if it is perceived as a special-interest doctrine designed to serve the interests only of the fortunate few at the top. **********The United States, along with Britain and some other Western countries, is in a conservative trend, stemming largely from the failures or exhaustion of liberal and socialist policies. **********This conservative trend, according to A. James Reichley, a former White House aide in the Ford Administration and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, ''is reflected not only in the recent electoral successes of conservative parties in many of the industrial democracies, but also in the growing conservatism of leadership groups in many liberal and even socialist parties who seek solutions to pressing problems common to most democratic countries, such as economic inflation, the drying up of sources of cheap energy, social dissonance, personal alienation, rampaging hedonism, institutional corruption, and the renewed dangers of Soviet aggression.'' **********Indeed, in this country the conservative trend may be more brilliantly illuminated on the Democratic side than the Republican side in Congress. For instance, the Democrats have been at least as eager to give tax benefits to business to stimulate investment.  Whichever plan wins in Congress, as Alan Greenspan, the conservative economist, put it, ''To borrow a phrase from the Administration, we're rolling in jelly beans.'' **********But, in his new book, ''Conservatives in an Age of Change,'' Mr.  Reichley warns against premature euphoria or overreaching on the right. ''A decisive shift to conservatism will not occur, or at least will not last very long,'' he says, ''if conservatism is no more than a rationalization for organized greed, or a soapbox for belligerent nationalism.'' **********He declares that if conservatism's roots are in the essential tradition of Western civilization, and even in the fundamental nature of humanity, its contemporary expression will need to show ''a breadth and nobility'' reflecting such origins. ''To approach this standard,'' he says, ''conservatism will have to include a capacity for change as well as foundations for stability.'' **********Having been hit so hard so soon with the charge that it is nothing but a rationalization for greed and a soapbox for belligerent nationalism, the Reagan Administration may need to demonstrate that it does in fact have a capacity for change and a breadth and nobility that encompass the working people and the poor as well as the rich."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/31/world/polish-food-shortage-spurs-new-unrest.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 546, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POLISH FOOD SHORTAGE SPURS NEW UNREST", "print_headline": "POLISH FOOD SHORTAGE SPURS NEW UNREST", "body_text": " **********Demonstrations and strike calls increased in Poland today as the independent labor organization attempted to channel popular anger against food shortages and meat-ration cuts. **********Solidarity's Warsaw local called a two-hour warning strike for next Wednesday and said that tomorrow a delegation of workers would present a petition to Parliament, which is debating the parlous economic situation. **********Transport workers here also called a three-hour strike for Wednesday, while locals in Gdansk and Czestochowa announced plans to stop work in August. **********This afternoon, thousands of women and children marched through the heart of the textile city of Lodz, culminating four days of protests there. **********The growing protests have punctured a faintly upbeat mood after the ruling Communist Party at its congress earlier this month introduced limited democratic procedures for selecting its leadership.

Little has been done with the idea, however, by banks and others who advertise Keogh plans and their tax advantages. **********And that is understandable. What young person with a newspaper route earning $500 a year thinks of putting 15 percent, or $75, into a Keogh plan if the money cannot be used, without penalty, until age 59 1/2? But that attitude does not take into consideration what parents or grandparents can do to help. In effect, they can put up the money for a youngster to salt away, tax-sheltered, in a Keogh plan. **********Keogh plans, named for Eugene J. Keogh, the former Congressman who sponsored the legislation, provide retirement plans for the selfemployed: for doctors, lawyers, salesmen, writers, artists, storeowners and others who work independently and are not covered by company pension plans. Keoghs can also be used by freelancers: consulting engineers, writers who sell articles, artists who sell paintings, even though many such persons hold regular jobs covered by corporate pension plans. **********Currently 15 percent of such freelance income can be put into a Keogh plan, up to a maximum $7,500 a year and thus be deducted from gross income on one's tax return. For the self-employed person whose earnings are low, the amount can nevertheless be as much as $750, provided at least that much is earned. For example, a person who earns only $1,000 can put up to $750 into a Keogh plan. The usual 15 percent ceiling does not apply. **********In addition to the obvious advantage of being deductible, the plan offers a second advantage: it accumulates dividends, interest and capital gains tax free. At age 59 1/2 a person can withdraw the money (and it must be withdrawn by age 70 1/2). At withdrawal the individual pays a tax figured by a complex formula. **********These days high school students can earn substantially more than pocket change from newspaper routes, cutting grass, painting houses, working as lifeguards, snow removal, tree pruning, baby-sitting. At college they often find even better-paying freelance jobs. **********If a youngster is earning money and eligible to set up a Keogh plan, nothing in the law bars parents or grandparents from reimbursing a child for money to be deposited in a Keogh account opened by the child. Florence Brady Donohue, a lawyer who specializes in women's tax problems in New York, said: ''It's a good idea for parents or grandparents to give children money for Keogh accounts.  The children might have to file income tax returns, however.'' **********In case of earned income, a child need not pay Federal income tax until he or she earns the $2,300 zero bracket amount plus the $1,000 personal exemption, or $3,300 total, during a year. In fact, the child with a Keogh could earn more without paying tax since the Keogh contribution cuts gross income. **********When someone is in a low bracket - as most youngsters are - the deductibility of Keogh contributions does not mean great tax savings, of course. In that case, the major benefit would be tax-free accumulation of dividends, interest and capital gains over many years. **********For example, suppose Donald Jr., a go-getter, earns $2,000 a year during high school. At college he earns more - $4,000 a year for four years. His parents decide they can afford to give him the equivalent each year of 15 percent for a Keogh plan - a total of $1,200 in high school years and $2,400 in college years, or $3,600 altogether. **********Let's assume that his Keogh plan grows to $5,000 by the time Donald Jr. takes a permanent job at age 22. Also assume that whatever plan handles the money - bank, mutual fund, broker - yields 9 percent a year thereafter. Compounded at 9 percent, money doubles in eight years. **********The accompanying chart shows roughly what could happen to Donald Jr.'s Keogh plan, without further contributions: He conceivably has a retirement fund of $160,000, which could be more or less depending on investment success. Inflation could take a toll, but the investments, if well chosen, might keep up. **********''It's a terrifc idea, and I cannot think of any drawback except for tantalization.'' John Klaus, head of the pension department at Prentice-Hall Inc., the financial and tax publishing company, said.  By ''tantalization,'' he meant that the young person might be tempted to withdraw money early, even though an early withdrawal entails a stiff penalty. **********''It certainly has not been thought of by many people,'' he said.  ''It offers no problems, and there's no doubt it would fly.'' He agreed that the $750 contribution for low-income freelancers made it even better. **********As another advantage, he said, with the Keogh plan steadily compounding, Donald Jr. might not feel he had to save as much money out of income when he starts working and marries. In addition, the Keogh plan is a partial substitute for life insurance; if the Keogh holder dies, the money goes to the spouse and children at advantageous tax rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/23/world/in-india-there-s-a-demonstration-for-any-occasion.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Kaufman", "pub_date": "1981-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 930, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN INDIA, THERE'S A DEMONSTRATION FOR ANY OCCASION", "print_headline": "IN INDIA, THERE'S A DEMONSTRATION FOR ANY OCCASION", "body_text": " **********Just as Eskimos have more than a hundred words for snow and Arabs have dozens of expressions for sand, so it is entirely fitting that people in India have many ways of saying demonstration. **********Every day in every city and large town groups of men and women march, chant, sit, fast or mill about to protest or support all sorts of things, ranging from public policies and salary scales to private utterances or religious behavior. **********From time to time the demonstrations flare into violence and are treated nationally as front-page news. But mostly they remain highly ritualized local events that barely impinge on the awareness of passers-by. **********The forms of the protests vary greatly. There is, for instance, the ''gherao,'' in which the target of the protest - often a college head or company manager - is blockaded in his office by a demonstrating throng. There is also that monument to Indian pragmatism, the ''relay hunger strikes,'' in which groups of protesters take turns skipping meals to dramatize their grievances. 36 Separate Demonstrations **********The high incidence and great diversity of protesting was reflected in a cursory survey of the Indian press over two recent days that turned up small reports of 36 separate demonstrations. **********A few of the headlines provided a sampler of the more common types of agitations: ''Black Flags at Two Places,'' ''Rasta Roko Stir by Bombay Party,'' ''West Uttar Pradesh Lawyers Stage Dharna,'' ''Black Day by Medical Students,'' ''Token Fast by Government Printing Staff'' and ''Clerks on Mass Casual Leave.'' The terms are explained in the glossary below. **********Often the demonstrations involve processions and in such cases they clearly take their inspiration from religious festivals and rites.  Others echo the campaigns of civil disobedience with which Mohandas K. Gandhi shook and broke the ties of the British Empire. All of them involve the use and movement of human bodies, something that India has in great abundance. **********Romesh Thapar, a journalist and a pillar of New Delhi's intellectual inner circle, remarked some months ago that this mobilizing of bodies for rallies and protests was the single Indian manifestation in a democratic system that he said was otherwise simply cloned from the British model. Mr. Thapar scorned what has been termed ''rent-a-crowd politics,'' but he acknowledged their impact on political and social life. ''Our throngs are as much a part of our political processes as polling and motivational research are in the United States,'' he said. Indian Terms Explained **********These are some of the more purely Indian types of demonstrations: Satyagraha - A term coined by Gandhi that literally means a protest by truth. It applies to almost any form of civil disobedience.  Rasta roko - This means ''block the road,'' and it is becoming increasingly popular, especially among groups of farmers who have thronged highways creating long traffic jams in order to dramatize their claims for higher prices for their crops. **********Morcha - This means procession and it can be anything from a straggly little outing to a real hike with a column of marchers several miles long. **********Pen down strike - In this protest workers come to the office but do nothing. A version of this was recently called by the All-India Station Masters Federation, which put up posters saying they would hold a ''control phone boycott.'' As explained by a stationmaster in Kerala this meant that the railroad employees were not going to answer the phones that report delays, reroutings and oncoming trains. **********Gherao - This is a Bengali word meaning surround, and it describes a tactic first introduced by Maoist activists in the 1960's. It involves assembling in such a way as to imprison people in their offices. **********Black flags - In this demonstration protesters show up with black flags that are supposed to show their disgust and shame the target of the protest. When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain arrived here last week several small groups waved black flags for her. They were not anarchists. She did not seem to notice or mind. **********Black day - In this maneuver people come to work wearing a black armband, indicating that they are displeased with their employer or conditions of work. **********Mass casual leave - This is not a strike but it is hard to tell the difference. Basically, everybody suddenly stays home from work or school. There are no pickets or slogans. **********Dharna - This is a strike, with pickets and placards. There is also a subcategory known as ''sitting dharna,'' in which a prominent and highly respected man sits by himself in front of the alleged exploiter. If he is distinguished enough the lone sitter is thought to have the force of as many as 50,000 people and he can bring enormous moral pressure to bear on the strike target. **********Then there are the hunger strikes. A drawn-out fast is rare, though ''token'' strikes in which groups gather to skip lunch or dinner are quite common. And there is the ''relay hunger strike.'' For more than six months the Association of Unemployed Airplane Pilots maintained a vigil in a gaily colored tent it erected on a downtown street. **********The generally robust young men maintained around-the-clock shifts in the tent, vowing to keep missing alternate meals until someone gave them jobs flying light propeller craft. Perhaps they got their wish or they starved because, quite suddenly, they were gone."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/17/world/no-a-hot-rio-day-icy-beer-and-minimal-swimsuits.html": {"writer_name": "Warren Hoge", "pub_date": "1981-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1050, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NO A HOT RIO DAY, ICY BEER AND MINIMAL SWIMSUITS", "print_headline": "NO A HOT RIO DAY, ICY BEER AND MINIMAL SWIMSUITS", "body_text": " **********News of jewel thefts at luxury hotels gave way the other day to an account of a truck hijacking that could be taken as a sure sign of summer. Four gunmen commandeered the rig and made off with its cargo, 11,000 quart bottles of beer. **********The hijackers knew their business. When the air in Rio wrinkles from the heat in January, February and March, the wavy image that most often registers on the retina is a sweating glass of lager. **********This month Cariocas, as the inhabitants of Rio are known, are being told by breweries that there will be a shortage. Some bars are already rationing to keep enough on hand to slake the thirst of steady customers. **********''Chopp,'' as draft beer is called in Portuguese, is a word uttered frequently at this time of year, often in a dry whisper. The quality of the product is unsurpassed; even German tourists brighten with admiration at the first swallow. **********Beer is sold at the more than 5,000 stand-up lunch counters in Rio, at cafes along the beachfront, in supermarkets and from the shacks that house mom-and-pop groceries in the chockablock hillside slums.  About the only place it cannot be found is Maracana, the soccer stadium that seats 200,000 fans, more than any other arena in the world. The authorities decided long ago that passions there are high enough. **********Shirtsleeves can pass for being overdressed in many parts of town.  More common attire is a bathing suit, and in Rio that can mean almost nothing at all, for the Brazilian bathing suit has been doing a gradual disappearing act for several years. **********You will see people in bathing suits on downtown streets, on buses, in restaurants and at home. Pregnant women are not reluctant to wear bikinis, though some suspend a discreet awning from the suit top. **********When the Christmas holidays arrive and temperatures regularly soar above 100 degrees, the matinal procession to the beach takes on the aspects of a tribal migration. People swarm there to escape the heat and the congestion of the city, whose five million people live in one of the world's densest urban concentrations. **********Swimming is an in-and-out affair. Not many Cariocas stray out as far as the breakers, perhaps wary of becoming one of the two or three drowning victims each sunny summer weekend. The more common pattern is to stand at water's edge in clutches, talking business, gossiping or doing something that, in Portuguese, is decorously called ''making charm'' and usually involves members of the opposite sex. **********Subsistence is provided by hardy barefoot vendors who somehow maintain their good nature while plying the beach and percussively singing out their offerings - cold drinks, hot dogs, coconuts, pineapples, sweets, biscuits, ice cream, shrimp cooked on a spit, meat pies, beach chairs, tanning lotions, kites, parasols and, of course, beer. **********The beach offers a lot of well-tanned and well-toned flesh to admire. More than half the population is 18 years old or younger, and many of the rest hold age at bay by working out on gymnastic equipment at the edge of the pavement along the waterfront. **********For all the warmth of summer in the Southern Hemisphere, murders, assaults and holdups have created a profound climate of fear, displacing the easygoing style that characterized Rio and replacing with deadly seriousness the romance that surrounded its fabled character, the ''malandro.'' **********A streetcorner type with no visible means of support, the malandro typified a Carioca capacity to get by with a lot of wits and little work. His method was the ''jeito,'' a word that roughly translates as ''knack'' and is necessary in almost every daily transaction. **********Jeito is usually practiced best by Brazilians, a notable exception being Ronald Biggs, long Britain's most wanted man as the last of the great train robbers of 1963. He was awaiting deportation in 1974 after being discovered as a fugitive from a London prison until he learned that his mistress, a nightclub dancer, was pregnant. He quickly acted on a law that forbids the expulsion of the father of a dependent Brazilian child, and he is still here, an honorary malandro. **********Jeito lives on in an institutionalized form in the person of the ''despachante.'' Though in English they would be called fixers, they are so much an established part of life that they are listed in the yellow pages. They know the back entrances to the bureaucracy that governs so many aspects of life. For a price they can speed the process of getting something officially authorized; for a higher price they can speed it even more. **********Speed does not characterize motion here, but rhythm does. The kettle drums, tambourines, whistles, rattles, graters, cowbells and other timpani of the highly organized samba schools are beating out their locomotive cadences every night in the slums as they prepare for the Carnival competition early in March. Watch a construction worker or an elevator operator or a passenger on an airplane fall to idle finger tapping and you will invariably hear the samba beat. **********Life is much harder for most Cariocas than the cheerful cadence of a samba would suggest. Class distinctions are strong and social mobility is slight. **********Look at the city from the 2,330-foot height at the base of the mountaintop statue of Christ the Redeemer and you will see that even the air is apportioned on a preferential basis. Over the slums and industrial suburbs of the north the atmosphere is jaundiced, choked with pollution and trapped by surrounding hills; to the south and west, where people with money live and work, the sky is cleansed by sea breezes. **********Carnival represents a chance to turn this system on its head, if only for four days. The poor dress like kings and queens and the streets are theirs. Then they return to their roles and their routines. **********With violence, inflation and headlong building patterns that are turning the city into a nest of characterless high-rises, much of the color and gracefulness of life that tempered those harsh divisions has vanished."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/31/world/around-the-world-246465.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 25, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD", "body_text": " **********Ecuador denied today that Peru had recaptured positions held by Ecuadorean forces.

Gutfreund, managing partner, on the idea, he said, was ''the overwhelming business fit - it so tickled me.'' Growing Pains **********Since Mr. Gutfreund assumed the post nearly three years ago, Salomon has been undergoing growing pains. Part of this process is visible in the steady stream of partners leaving the firm in the last few years. This week's disclosure that six more partners will leave the firm on Oct. 1 is a continuation of that process, Mr. Gutfreund said. **********Although he confirmed that this latest group included three people in corporate finance, Robert Bernhard, Norman Levy and Craig Stearns, the firm emphasized that it does not mean the new firm will move away from investment banking.

Of course, the exact figure at the end of September, and the share that will go to the limited partners, is still undetermined. Phibro has said that it will replenish that capital with its own funds. **********Furthermore, each general partner will receive a share of $250 million of 9 percent debentures, convertible into Phibro stock at $27.78 a share, over five years. The first year, partners will be allowed to convert up to 35 percent of their debentures; the second year, an additional 25 percent, and 13 1/3 percent each year for the following three years. Partners would have to pay capital gains taxes on those debentures when they convert them, the firm said. **********The seven members of Salomon's executive committee have signed five-year employment contracts, while the other partners who are staying on have signed three-year contracts. **********Although Salomon employees will no longer be considered partners, the firm will establish a similar category of ''managing directors.''

Derow has resigned as chairman and president of Newsweek Inc. and will replace John S. Suhler as president of the CBS/Publishing group. **********The sudden move marked the second time in four years that Mr.  Derow, 41 years old, has left the presidency of Newsweek for a high executive position at CBS Inc. In 1978, the Washington Post Company, Newsweek's parent, was able to lure Mr. Derow back to Newsweek only six months after he left it to become a senior vice president at CBS. **********In Washington, Katharine Graham, chairman of the Washington Post Company, announced that Mark Edmiston, 38, an executive vice president and head of domestic business operations for Newsweek, would succeed Mr. Derow as president. Newsweek publishes the weekly news magazine, as well as a new monthly called Inside Sports, and operates video and book divisions. The post of chairman and Mr.  Derow's position on the board of directors of the Washington Post Company were not immediately filled. **********Record Profits in 1980 **********The CBS/Publishing group is one of nation's largest suppliers of educational and professional learning materials and publishes various magazines, including Women's Day and Field and Stream, trade books and paperbacks. Last year, it had operating profits of $42.4 million on sales of $541.9 million, both group records. **********Because both Newsweek and CBS/ Publishing have been performing relatively well while many publishing enterprises have been struggling, the changes touched off speculation about possible personality conflicts and corporate intrigue in both companies. **********Sources at CBS said that Mr. Derow had been offered the position of president of the Washington Post Company by Mrs. Graham but had turned it down. Mrs. Graham said that the position had been ''discussed'' but that a formal offer had not been made because Mr.  Derow had made it clear he wanted to stay in New York. **********''The key is that I want to work in New York and that I think CBS is on the cutting edge of a lot of important developments,'' Mr.  Derow said, declining to discuss whether he had been offered the Washington Post position. He said that his decision to return to Newsweek from CBS in 1978 had involved ''a different job under different management.'' He added that he has known and respected Thomas H. Wyman, CBS Inc.'s new president, for 12 years. **********Mr. Suhler, 38, said that his resignation after two years in his current position and eight with the publishing group was involuntary but not acrimonious. Asked about speculation by analysts that the switch was related to a general housecleaning of executives associated with James D. Backe, whom Mr. Wyman replaced just over a year ago, Mr. Suhler said, ''I think there is something to that.'' **********Sources at the company said that the attitudes of William S.

They fled when the Government sent in reinforcements and began bombing. **********But the guerrillas still control about a third of Morazan, the region where Perquin is located, according to a longtime resident who travels frequently in the mountainous countryside. Prepared for Another Attack **********Soldiers guarding this outpost said they were fired on nightly by the guerrillas, and were prepared for another attack.  This morning some woodcutters were stopped by guerrillas and asked about Perquin's military defenses, according to Rafael Antonio Orellano, a lieutenant in charge of the 20 National Guard soldiers here. Thirty army rangers are also defending the village, which is less than 10 miles from the Honduran border. **********Asked about the military situation, Lieut.

Army Says It's in Control **********Government and military officials have insisted that the army has had complete control of this area since August. But they have repeatedly denied requests by foreign correspondents to visit Perquin, saying they could not guarantee the safety of the reporters. **********Today three reporters were permitted to travel here along the 25-mile road from San Francisco, the region's capital. But the authorization came only after the reporters signed a letter saying the Government would not be responsible if anything happened to them. They were then given a ''safe conduct pass'' by the military commander in San Francisco. **********The pass strictly limited the journalists to traveling between San Francisco and Perquin. They were not allowed into the surrounding mountains, where the guerrillas have reportedly set up village governments and are engaged in small-scale farming. A priest said he no longer visited these villages to perform his pastoral duties because he would be accused by the army of ''fomenting Communism.'' **********The road from San Francisco to Perquin is patrolled by small groups of soldiers. The authorities have yet to repair eight trenches, up to three feet deep, that the guerrillas dug across the road to impede military vehicles. Throughout the country, soldiers are burning and clearing wide swathes along the sides of roads. But the journey here has large stretches where dense tall weeds are sprawling onto the blacktop, heightening the danger of a guerrilla attack. At one point a notice neatly painted on the surface declares that travelers are entering a Farabundo Marti ''Liberated Zone.''

In addition to killing four soldiers, he said, the guerrillas took some soldiers prisoner. He did not say how many. **********A religious leader in San Francisco said today that the guerrillas offered to release the prisoners to the International Red Cross. In addition, he said, the Red Cross offered to try to arrange a 12-hour cease-fire. The Government did not permit the Red Cross to get involved, according to the man, who asked not to be identified. **********Radio Venceremos, the guerrilla station that reportedly operates from somewhere in the mountains near here, said in August that the insurgents had left Perquin because they did not want civilians killed and the town destroyed by bombing. Leftist leaders said the takeover of Perquin was a success because it showed that the guerrillas were stronger than the Government contended.

However, the residents said the guerrillas took 18 men and women from the village with them when they left. **********Sitting in a tiny general store, a woman whose husband was among those captured said all 18 escaped and returned to the village. An older woman, a towel wrapped around her head, said her son, forced by the guerrillas to build fortifications, escaped when the bombing began. **********As the journalists were preparing to leave today, a woman approached and asked softly if they were Red Cross workers here to distribute food. **********There is no electricity, drinkable water and bus service here. Only a few trucks and cars risk the journey to the village to bring in supplies for civilians. Lieutenant Mata said military helicopters were flying in supplies for the soldiers. **********Everyone who wants to come here must first receive a pass from the commander in San Francisco, said a 25-year-old teacher who lives in Perquin. **********Asked about the military situation, a 19-year-old soldier who has been in the army for 10 months and receives $72 a month, answered, ''It's a mess.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/07/business/business-people-unc-says-colussy-is-its-choice-if-airline-marger-is-successful.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1981-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 337, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNC SAYS COLUSSY IS ITS CHOICE IF AIRLINE MARGER IS SUCCESSFUL", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; UNC SAYS COLUSSY IS ITS CHOICE IF AIRLINE MARGER IS SUCCESSFUL", "body_text": " **********Dan A.

That requirement could be satisfied by a small increase in the standard deduction, plus a partial abatement of the ''marriage penalty'' imposed by joint filing on many working couples. **********''If a compromise is going to be reached, that is the most plausible way to do it,'' said Representative James R. Jones, Democrat of Oklahoma, an influential member of the Ways and Means Committee. **********Such a package was discussed in talks last week between House Democrats, including Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and senior Administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan. Further negotiations are expected this week, after Congress returns from the long Memorial Day weekend. **********Although the main elements of a compromise package seem to be defined, one important issue remains unresolved. President Reagan has not retreated from his original proposal of rate cuts of 10 percent a year in each of three years. Although Mr. Rostenkowski has declared he wants a one-year bill, many Democrats, including aides to Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., have said they could accept a two-year bill. **********Thus, a third year looms as the crucial difference between a decisive Reagan victory and a significant White House concession.  In the Senate, controlled by the Republicans, it is an open secret that Chairman Bob Dole of the finance committee has no desire for a three-year tax cut. This has led to speculation that Mr. Dole and Mr. Rostenkowski, each in his first year as chairman and eager to show that tax bills are written in Congress, not the White House, might forge an entente of their own in favor of a two-year bill. **********But, said one congressional veteran, ''I don't see how Dole could control the Senate floor without the Administration behind him.'' If the White House and Mr. Rostenkowski come to terms, the bill that the heavily Democratic Ways and Means Committee is to start drafting next week would be assured of easy sailing on the House floor. But if a ''grand alliance'' cannot be forged in the next few days, there could be a pitched battle with the Republicans seeking the support of Southern Democrats for a substitute for the Ways and Means bill. **********How to deliver tax relief to business is much less controversial this year than tax relief for individuals. There is broad support for giving business faster writeoffs for the cost of vehicles, machines and buildings, although some important details are still at issue.  Deductions for depreciation reduce taxable income and taxes owed. **********Small business just may get modest relief in the corporate tax rate. There is a slim chance, say Congressional aides, that Congress also will shrink the portion of capital gains subject to tax, now 40 percent. How much room there is for these secondary types of tax relief will depend on how much revenue is earmarked for general relief for individuals and couples. **********The Administration has proposed $44 billion of cuts for individuals and $10 billion for business for the 1982 fiscal year, which starts next Oct. 1. But with the economy stronger than expected, sentiment is growing in Congress -and within the Administration - to shrink the revenue loss and the budget deficit in fiscal 1982. **********One way would be to make the personal tax cut effective Jan. 1, 1982, as proposed by Representative Kent Hance of Texas, a junior Democrat on Ways and Means who also has proposed holding down the first round of relief to 5 percent instead of 10. **********Mr. Rostenkowski and Mr. Jones have said that to win Democratic support a tax bill must be weighted toward the broad middle class of taxpayers with incomes of $20,000 to $50,000. ''If I, as a Democrat, can be accused of income redistribution, it's to this group,'' Mr.  Rostenkowski has said. **********Because taxpayers in this income bracket account for one-third of all taxpayers and half of all income tax paid, the benefits of a larger standard deduction and an abatement of the ''marriage penalty'' would accrue heavily in this range. **********The standard deduction now is $2,300 for single taxpayers and $3,400 for couples. The ''modest liberalization'' Mr. Rostenkowski has mentioned would probably be $100 for individuals and $200 for couples. Such increases in the deduction would reduce total taxes owed by $1.6 billion. Of that sum, $710 million, or 44.5 percent, would accrue to taxpayers in the $20,000-$50,000 range. Another $266 million, or 16.7 percent, would go to taxpayers with incomes of $15,000 to $20,000. **********A frequently mentioned formula for relieving the ''marriage penalty'' -the difference between what a couple pays filing jointly and what they would pay if unmarried and filing separately - is to permit a deduction of 10 percent of the lower-earning partner's income up to a limit of $30,000. **********The tax saving from such a maximum deduction of $3,000 would be heavily weighted in the middle ranges, the analysts say. They calculate that 48.1 percent of the benefits would go to couples with combined incomes of $20,000 to $50,000 and 19.5 percent would fall into the $15,000 to $20,000 bracket. **********In addition, Congress is likely to liberalize the allowed deductions from taxable income for money deposited in individual retirement accounts. A popular proposal is to broaden elegibility for such accounts to employees of companies with pension plans.  Originally, the accounts were created only for employees of companies without pension plans. **********How much revenue would be lost in this way is uncertain because it depends on how much money taxpayers will stash away in these accounts. Nevertheless, the analysts believe that these tax savings also will fall heavily in the middle-income ranges."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/19/world/at-the-wailing-wall-a-remembrance-and-a-warning.html": {"writer_name": "David Shipler", "pub_date": "1981-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1005, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AT THE WAILING WALL, A REMEMBRANCE AND A WARNING", "print_headline": "AT THE WAILING WALL, A REMEMBRANCE AND A WARNING", "body_text": " **********In a somber mood of warning for the future, 5,000 survivors of the ghettos and the concentration camps of Hitler's Europe ended four days of remembrance and reunion tonight at Jerusalem's Wailing Wall, the holiest place in Judaism, where they passed the legacy of the Holocaust symbolically to their children. **********Gathered beside the great stones that formed the western wall of the Temple Mount in Herod's time, the survivors heard and echoed admonitions to keep alive the memory of the horror that took six million Jews to their deaths. They lit thousands of candles and watched six torches, one for each million, flare in the night as a nearly-full moon rose above the place where the Romans burned the Second Temple in A.D. 70. **********It was a powerful conjunction of symbols and emotions, and Prime Minister Menachem Begin caught the tone as he declared to the assembled throng in Yiddish: ''Mir zaynen do. We are here.'' **********''Where is the Emperor? Where is his might? Where is Rome?'' asked Mr. Begin. ''Jerusalem lives forever. We are here.'' First Worldwide Gathering **********An apprehension that the Holocaust would be forgotten, or that its evil would be tempered by the passing of the generation that lived through it, was a central force in bringing survivors together for the first worldwide gathering since their liberation from the Germans in 1945. **********Furthermore, as conversations with many of them revealed, they are now moved to record their experiences, to speak out, both by the approach of their own deaths and a renewed sense of fear at what they see as rising anti-Semitism. The most infuriating symptom, many said, is the synthetic history now being published by a few American and French polemicists who are trying to prove that the Holocaust never happened. **********Abraham H. Foxman, associate national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said in an interview that until recently it had been difficult to get survivors to talk about their experiences, to spread the word. ''For 30 years they kept silent,'' he noted. ''Ten years ago we couldn't get anybody to talk.  Revisionism was a catalyst. That's touched them so personally. It's an indignity to all they went through.'' **********Samuel Pisar, a lawyer, author and survivor, explained his feelings in a conversation. ''To me the Holocaust is no longer a lamentation. To me it's a warning. It's a warning to Jews and non-Jews alike, from people like myself who have lived through the collapse of the world, and who know that worlds do collapse.'' 'The End of Creation' **********''When I look back today to Auschwitz,'' he continued, ''I have the personal feeling that I have witnessed the end of creation. In the shadow of flaming gas chambers I've seen the premonition of the death rattle of the species that was about to enter the thermonuclear age.  I feel that what I lived there was a pilot project of the destruction of humanity. You know that the unthinkable is indeed possible. And evil times are returning. When uneasiness and fear come back, then it is the season for demagogues.'' **********In a farewell address to the gathering, Elie Wiesel, the author, also struck a note of warning. ''Have we, survivors, done our duty?  Something went wrong with our testimony; it was not received.  Otherwise things would have been different. Look, look at the world around us: suspicion again, violence everywhere, hatred everywhere, organized state-sponsored terror, racism, fascism, fanatcisim, anti-Semitism. **********''Had anyone told us, when we were liberated, that we shall be compelled in our lifetime to fight anti-Semitism once more; or worse, that we shall have to prove that our suffering was genuine, that our victims had perished indeed -we would have had no strength to lift our eyes from the ruins. If only we could tell the tale. we thought, the world would change. Well, we have told the tale, and the world remained the same.'' **********The worry was crystallized by two schoolteachers at the gathering, one a survivor of Auschwitz named Edith Singer, born in Czechoslovakia, now teaching in California, and a daughter of concentration camp survivors named Arlene Goldfarb, from New York City. Schoolchildren Do Not Know **********Mrs. Singer had a jolt when an 8-year-old boy in her class noticed the number tatooed on her arm. ''What is this number?'' he asked.  ''Your phone number?'' She wanted to slap his face, then realized that he simply did not know. **********Miss Goldfarb told her class why she was coming to this gathering, and afterward a 13-year-old girl came to her and asked, ''What's a concentration camp?'' **********It was to help keep the memory alive that the legacy, signed by all those present, was transferred tonight. ''We, the survivors, are growing older,'' said Benjamin Meed, an Israeli and co-chairman of the gathering. ''We may never again gather together as we have this week. The burden of preserving the legacy of the Holocaust is now to be passed on to our children and the people of Israel.'' **********The legacy was then read by six survivors in six languages - Hebrew, Yiddish, English, French, Ladino and Russian.  ''We take this oath!'' it began. ''We take it in the shadow of flames whose tongues scar the soul of our people. We vow in the name of dead parents and children. We vow, with our sadness hidden, our faith renewed. We vow, we shall never let the sacred memory of our perished six million be scorned or erased.'' **********And it concluded: ''Let our legacy endure as a stone of the temple wall. For here prayers and memories burn. They burn and burn and will not be consumed.'' **********To which the children, now young adults, replied in part: ''We accept the obligation of this legacy.

Security was intense, and the funeral rite, from which ordinary Egyptians were barred, appeared to go smoothly. **********Al Ahram said today that the plotters had planned a bomb attack against Egyptian officials at the funeral because of ''a rare opportunity of having their targets assembled all in one place.'' **********The newspaper said a number of loosely aligned Moslem fundamentalist groups bent on deposing Mr. Sadat and his secular regime had planned to install as temporary leader Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a blind mufti, whom the investigators accused of having provided a religious rationale for killing Mr. Sadat. Sheik Rahman is under arrest. 587 Reported Arrested **********Al Ahram reported that 587 people had been arrested so far in the investigation into Mr. Sadat's death. President Hosni Mubarak said the other day that he expected a full report soon and that it would be made public. No date has been set for issuing the report, although another newspaper said it would be made available next week. **********Sheik Rahman is not well known here, according to Egyptian officials queried today. The report in Al Ahram carried a picture of a man it identified as ''the ideologue of the terrorists.'' It showed a man over 40 with a frizzy beard. **********Many of the officials the plotters reportedly planned to kill at the funeral were in the reviewing stand at the military parade when Mr. Sadat was killed. **********Al Ahram said: ''It was found out that they had decided to repeat the attempt, planning to kill all the officials who took part in the late President's funeral, considering this as a chance for them because of the presence of all these officials in one place.'' Extraordinary Measures Taken **********The extraordinary security at Mr. Sadat's funeral included plainclothes policemen, uniformed guards, military units, Egyptian Secret Service officials and dozens, perhaps hundreds, of foreign security men accompanying the world leaders who briefly attended the service. **********The foreign dignitaries, who included former Presidents Richard M.  Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, marched in a procession on the parade grounds and briefly greeted Mr. Sadat's widow, Jihan, before speeding away in their limousines. The Sadat family, Mr.  Mubarak and other top officials then walked across the field to the site of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where Mr. Sadat was temporarily interred after a half-hour service. **********According to Al Ahram, Sheik Rahman has confessed to issuing a fatwa, or religious decree, giving permission to the fundamentalist conspirators to carry out the plot. The newspaper said the decree ordered those chosen to carry out the attempt ''not to try to commit suicide after the incident because then 'they would die as infidels.' '' Instead, the account said, they should try to escape, and if gunned down by soldiers they would be 'martyrs.' **********The newspaper said Sheik Rahman had been chosen to be an interim leader while the fundamentalists seized control and carried out a ''Khomeini-type revolution'' to replace the Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/15/world/around-the-world-france-plans-expansion-of-its-nuclear-forces.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; France Plans Expansion Of Its Nuclear Forces", "print_headline": "Around the World; France Plans Expansion Of Its Nuclear Forces", "body_text": " **********Defense Minister Charles Hernu announced today in Parliament that France would develop a new tactical missile system and build a seventh nuclear submarine.

This might result in lower retail pork and poultry prices by the end of the year, in the view of analysts, and prevent any substantial rise in beef prices next winter. **********Large Subsidy Foreseen **********But lower grain prices for farmers would increase the number of price support loans on their 1981 crops, raising the Government's expenditures for handling and storing wheat and corn taken later as payment for the loans. **********Average farm prices for wheat are already below the Government's target of $3.81. Unless they unexpectedly rise above that before Nov.1, direct subsidy payments to wheat farmers would cost $300 million to $500 million, which would come out of Mr. Reagan's budget for the fiscal year 1982. **********The forecast of record wheat and corn crops was likely to add to Mr. Reagan's difficulties in trying to get Congress to reduce the costly farm price support and subsidy levels that its agriculture committees have written into the omnibus farm bill. The Senate is scheduled to take up the measure next week. **********By late this afternoon the Administration had failed to reach a firm compromise on these loan and subsidy levels with most of the farm state Republicans, who form a majority on the Senate Agriculture Committee. **********Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the committee, said he would offer amendments to cut almost $1.3 billion from the cost of the Senate committee's legislation if the Administration would support them. **********Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, said he would also attempt to amend the committee bill, to give the Agriculture Secretary the authority to set loan and subsidy payments at any level he chose. Senator Lugar said the committee's bill in its current form would result in commodity support costs next year that would exceed the Congressional budget limits by at least $1.5 billion. Small Soviet Crop Forecast **********The only encouraging news for farmers and the Reagan Administration in today's production forecasts was a new estimate of Soviet grain production, which the department's Foreign Agriculture Service forecast at 180 million metric tons. This would be one of the smallest Soviet crops in the past nine years and the third year in a row in which Soviet wheat and feed grain harvests had fallen far below that country's goals. The department's previous Russian grain forecast was 185 million tons. **********In 1979, when their grain production fell to 179.2 million tons, the Russians ordered more than 25 million tons of American wheat, corn and soybeans. **********With the American wheat harvest completed and the corn and soybean harvests about to begin, today's forecasts were considered much more accurate than last month's. The prediction of a 7.94-billion-bushel corn crop was 3 percent hi gher t han las t month's estimate. A yield of this magnitude would be19 percent larg er than last year's drought-reduced crop and slightly greater than th e 1979 record of 7.93 billion bushels. **********Earlier this week Conrad Leslie, a leading private forecaster, predicted that total corn production would reach 8.04 billion bushels and the soybean 2.04 billion bushels. **********The Crop Reporting Board today estimated soybean production at 2.09 billion bushels, up 15 percent from the 1980 crop of 1.81 billion bushels and close to the 1979 record of 2.26 billion. **********A 1981 wheat crop of more than 2.75 billion bushels would be 16 percent larger than last year's record crop of 2.37 billion bushels.  There was also good news for fanciers of peanuts and peanut butter: The board estimated that total peanut production would reach 3.86 billion pounds, 67 percent more than the drought-reduced 1980 crop of 2.31 billion pounds. **********The board forecast this year's cotton crop at 15.5 million bales, 39 percent larger than 1980's 11.1 million bales."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/27/business/spencer-companies-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPENCER COMPANIES reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "print_headline": "SPENCER COMPANIES reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/13/business/business-people-growing-with-lehman-again-after-sojourn-in-washington.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1981-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GROWING WITH LEHMAN AGAIN AFTER SOJOURN IN WASHINGTON", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; GROWING WITH LEHMAN AGAIN AFTER SOJOURN IN WASHINGTON", "body_text": " **********Roger C.

Moreover, Iran had previously refused to consider moves to end the war while Iraqi troops remained on its soil. **********But there was no direct statement from Teheran, the Iranian capital, or any immediate comment from Iraq.  (Officials in Algiers were reported to have said earlier this week that Algeria would be willing to mediate the war but that Iran had given no indication it was ready for such a step.) Arafat Has Offered Services **********Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has repeatedly offered his group's services to Iran. It was not clear from Ambassador Ardakani's remarks whether any formal arrangements were being made. Mr. Ardakani's statements appeared in the English-language newspaper Arab Times in Kuwait and the Arabiclanguage Al Khaleej in the United Arab Emirates. **********In Teheran, meanwhile, a Cabinet minister reiterated that Iran would not participate in a conference of leaders of 38 Islamic nations opening Sunday in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, where another proposal for cease-fire mediation might be discussed.

But the offer is about to expire, and the rock-bottom rate of 13.8 percent will only be available to consumers who take delivery of the vehicle by the end of next Wednesday. **********The reason for the offer, which was first made on July 28 and then extended on Aug. 31, was to perk up sluggish sales and help clear out the large inventory of unsold cars before the bulk of the 1982 models reach dealer showrooms. The offer is only for the purchase of new 1981 vehicles and 1982 ''J'' cars such as the Chevy Cavalier or Cadillac Cimarron. **********''We felt that a lot of people were not buying cars because of high interest rates,'' said John Andrews, a G.M.A.C. spokesman. **********According to General Motors, the offer will save consumers an average of $550 on the financing cost of a typical G.M. car, compared with unsubsidized financing available from other lenders such as banks. **********This assumes that people borrow an average of $7,593 and would otherwise pay a rate of 17 percent on a car loan lasting about 45 months. But the $550 is a nationwide figure, and the projected sav ings vary depending on the loan term and t he interest rate that prevail in a given area. **********Mr. Andrews said the savings range from a low of $300 in Connecticut to a high of $800 in California. In New York, the benefit of the rate cut is $725 while in New Jersey it is only $650, he added. **********But the subsidized rate is not available everywhere. The offer is not being made in Arkansas, which has a 10 percent usury ceiling, Mr. Andrews said. Nor is it available from the 5 percent or so of G.M.  dealers who objected to sharing part of the cost of the promotion with the company. (The offer requires dealers to forgo 70 percent of their participation in the finance charge, which typically works out to about $150 over the life of the loan.) In general, the auto maker's financing offer of 13.8 percent is a hard one for other lenders to beat. It is for a maximum term of 48 months, and w hile a down payment is required, the amount is flexible,depending on the creditworthiness of the buyer. **********''I can't imagine any bank that can do it for less than that, because they don't have to worry about inventory,'' said Susan Weeks of Citibank. The bank, the largest in New York, is charging 18 percent to customers who have checking or savings accounts there, and 20 percent to people without such ties. **********According to the Federal Reserve Board, which collects information on loan rates charged by commercial banks, the average rate on a 36-month new-car loan from a bank in August was 16.92 percent. A spotcheck of banks around the country indicates that rates do not seem to have varied much since then, making the G.M.A.C. offer as attractive as ever. **********For example, the Bank of America, the nation's biggest bank, charges between 18 percent and 19 percent, depending on the length of the loan. The Continental Illinois Bank in Chicago also has a sliding rate that ranges from 15.85 percent to 15.95 percent. The Amalgamated Bank, traditionally one of the lowest-cost sources of financing in the New York area, is charging 15.15 percent for loans to purchase new American-made cars. **********Even credit unions are hard-pressed to match the G.M.A.C. offer.  The Credit Union National Association, a trade group that represents more than 90 percent of all credit unions, does not collect information on rates charged by members on a nationwide basis. But Howard Cosgrove, a spokesman for the association, said he believed that ''a few months ago, the majority of credit unions were charging about 15 percent and are probably a little higher than that now.'' **********While a few credit unions, such as the National Capitol Federal Credit Union in Washington and the Newsweek Employees Federal Credit Union in New York, are charging as little as 12 percent on some loans, he said, the Pan Am Employees Credit Union in New York, which is charging 16 percent, ''is more typical.'' **********By all accounts, the offering has been a huge success. Mr. Andrews said that in August, G.M.A.C. wrote 215,000 loan contracts (of which about 172,000 took advantage of the offer). This was ''the highest for any single month in General Motors' history,'' he said, and compares with only 92,000 contracts written in August 1980. **********''It's clearly a great success for them,'' said Harvey E.  Heinbach, a vice president and research analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. He noted that G.M.'s market share went from 60.5 percent in July, before the promotion started, to 64 percent in August, ''and that's a big swing.'' **********Initially, he said, ''dealers were screaming, but when they saw how many people came in the showroom they were thrilled to death.'' Of course, G.M. is not alone in offering sweeteners to prospective buyers. Chrysler is offering direct rebates to customers, while Ford is offering dealer incentives that presumably are passed along to purchasers. **********Despite the difference in the form of the sales gimmicks, ''the amount that is being gained is probably not that different from company to company,'' Mr. Heinbach said. Customers should go where they happen to get the best deal on a car, he advised."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/28/business/advertising-at-lois-alexander-s-tv-bid-warner-video.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-09-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Lois: Alexander's TV Bid, Warner Video", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; At Lois: Alexander's TV Bid, Warner Video", "body_text": " **********Alexander's, the department store chain, is going to seriously try television advertising for the first time.

Haig Jr. met in New York today with Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, and a State Department spokesman said later that United States ''assistance'' would be necessary well into the 1990's for what was called ''the support'' of five Saudi Awacs aircraft. **********The statement was worded differently from one made by Mr. Haig yesterday in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Haig told the committee that because of what he called a shortage of Saudi air crews and technicians, ''there will be an American presence in the aircraft and on the ground well into the 1990's.'' **********Department of Defense estimates of the time necessary to train crews for Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft are much less than the more than 10 years suggested by Mr.  Haig's testimony yesterday. Training Time Varies **********A published United States Air Force statement said that about 300 NATO airmen who began training in July at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma to operate NATO Awacs were in programs that ''vary from 3 to 55 weeks, with an average time of about 4 months.'' **********Pentagon sources said that even with personnel from a nation such as Saudi Arabia ''it would take about two to three years'' to train senior noncommissioned officers who could operate and give in-flight servicing to the Awacs radar and on-board computer. These sources said it would not take that long to train the commissioned officers who act as ''controllers'' and man the surveillance and weaponscontrol consoles on an Awacs. **********The State Department press office said this afternoon that it was not able now to furnish any comment that might reconcile the very extended training periods suggested by Mr. Haig's testimony with those statements. A U.S. Training Presence **********Senate staff members opposed to the $8.5 billion sale of Awacs and other air combat equipment to the Saudis expressed a belief that the Administration statements about some American training presence on Saudi Awacs into the 1990's were meant to be a substitute for more formal joint United States-Saudi crews or joint command of the Awacs suggested by some members of Congress who are now leaning against the sale. **********Congress can block the sale if both houses vote to do so before the end of this month. Majorities in both houses appear to be leaning against the sale, even after President Reagan and Mr. Haig strongly urged yesterday that it be approved. **********A spokesman for Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, who is a leader of the group opposing the sale, said that all 50 senators who had agreed to co-sponsor a resolution of disapproval last month agreed to permit their names to remain on the resolution after President Reagan's news conference and Mr. Haig's testimony yesterday. **********Dean Fischer, the State Department spokesman, said after Mr.  Haig's meeting today with the Saudi Foreign Minister, ''The kingdom has requested maintenance and training assis tance, and the U.S. is willing to pr ovide such assistance, which will be necessary for the support of th e system well into the 1990's.'' Today's statement did not mention a n ''American presence'' on the Saudi aircraft in the 1990's. **********The Administration has always said that 400 to 480 United States civilian contractor experts would be necessary to service and maintain the Saudi Awacs when they begin to arrive in Saudi Arabia in 1985 and that, while the number would decrease considerably over the years, some such maintenance contractors would be necessary into the next century. But last April, and again in August, Administration officials said that the first two Saudi Awacs crews would be trained by the time the planes arrived in 1985 and that an American presence on the Awacs would ''fade away'' within a few years. Meeting Called Unsuccessful **********The original plan called for Saudi personnel to begin training for Awacs duties in the United States soon after the proposal cleared Congress and for substantial portions of the training to be completed before the Awacs were delivered. **********A number of people who were present at a two-and-a-half-hour closed meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday in which Mr. Haig and other State Department officials tried to persuade members of the committee to support the arms sale said the meeting had not been successful or especially amicable. **********Some opponents of the sale, who appear to be a majority on the committee as of now, said they had been unable to determine whether or not any agreement to insure joint American control of the Awacs while in flight had been reached in a week of negotiations with the Saudi Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/26/business/patents-027865.html": {"writer_name": "Lamp Invented", "pub_date": "1981-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PATENTS", "print_headline": "PATENTS", "body_text": " **********Tren V.

Tippins, president and owner of the Tippins Machinery Company, and Richard P. Simmons, president of the Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corporation, waited with suspense in the law offices of Buchanan, Ingersoll, Rodewald, Kyle & Buerger on the 57th floor of the United States Steel Building in downtown Pittsburgh. Flanked by a group of lawyers, both men were eager to close a deal for Mr. Tippins to buy Allegheny, the nation's largest stainless steel producer, from its parent, Allegheny Ludlum Industries. **********There was one hitch. Mr. Simmons, whose job it was to find a buyer, had earlier gone far afield and arranged a similar deal with a company headed by Clint W. Murchison Jr., the Texas financier. Now Mr. Simmons no longer wanted the Murchison deal. With much the same terms, he had lined up what he thought was a much better prospect: Mr. Tippins, who had made a fortune in the Pittsburgh area as a builder of steel rolling mills. **********The men were waiting to see whether Mr. Murchison would show up and lay claim to the company. To the relief of both, he didn't, and Mr.  Tippins drew a certified check out of his pocket toward purchase of 80 percent of the equity in the company. Mr. Simmons and some of his executive team picked up the remaining 20 percent. The total price was $195 million, of which $60 million was in cash and the rest in a note and preferred stock. **********Thus, the hometown boys combined to keep the outsiders from the business. As both saw it, the investor should not be tempted to milk the company to finance his interests elsewhere and the manager should have a free hand to continue to run the day-to-day business. ''To interfere with Simmons -that's the last thing I want,'' Mr. Tippins said. **********The closing was on Dec. 26. It may be too early to tell how the deal is working out, but to a large degree success depends on the willingness of both men to stay within their roles. The company, as a privately owned entity, is able to keep its profits and problems to itself. But there is every reason to believe that it is extremely well-positioned in the stainless steel industry and ready to benefit from the hometown synergism. **********Mr. Simmons has a good grasp of the business and has moved aggressively to phase out older equipment, said Charles A. Bradford, the steel analyst for Merrill Lynch. But he cautioned that a large share of flat rolled stainless steel is used by the auto industry to make catalytic converters. The auto makers, he said, are seeking cheaper and lighter alloys, and this could pose a problem for Allegheny Ludlum in the future. But another major Allegheny product, steel used in motors and generators, is a ''super business,'' Mr.  Bradford said, since this equipment is being upgraded or replaced in the drive for energy efficiency. **********B ECOMING a private company provides some advantages for running a capital-intensive business such as steel, Mr. Simmons said. One doesn't have to worry about satisfying the hunger of stockholders for dividends and the earnings performance demanded by Wall Street analysts. Also, he added, there is the worry that when one has built up a good business another company comes along and ''gobbles it up.'' **********Mr. Simmons, a man who pursues his goals tenaciously, according to former Allegheny executives, wants to spend $100 million in the next four years upgrading the equipment at the steel plants, expanding capacity and perhaps adding some specialty steels to the wide line that the company now makes. Mr. Simmons, who is 50 years old, has spent his career at Allegheny Ludlum except for stints at Republic Steel and Latrobe. He reports to Mr. Tippins by phone every week. **********The company was profitable under Allegheny Ludlum Industries, although its return on equity averaged about 7 percent, which was only half the return for the parent as a whole. But the company was not neglected by its parent, which spent $100 million in the last four years installing new melting capacity and a new continuous caster at plants in Natrona and Brackenridge, Pa. **********Allegheny Ludlum Industries (which has since changed its name to Allegheny International), said that it wanted to sell the company to avoid steel's vast capital needs and to cut loose from the industry's ride on the ups and downs of the business cycle. It also wanted cash for its diversification program - to help it acquire the 55.5 percent of the stock of Wilkinson Match that it didn't already own. **********For Mr. Tippins, 55, a man whose square-jawed face is framed by steel-rim glasses, the Allegheny deal represented the end of a long search to acquire a company. ''We came out of the woodwork and we had the money,'' he said in a recent interview at the Waldorf Astoria, where he was attending the annual get-together of the American Iron and Steel Institute. **********The new owner is no longer in the backwater of the Pittsburgh business world. The reputation of his Tippins Machinery Company, although it had built mills around the world, was confined mainly to steelmakers. It has its offices in a three-story red-brick former theater on the main street of Etna, six miles north of downtown Pittsburgh. **********Although obscure, it has been profitable. Mr. Tippins's search to buy a business was motivated by a desire to diversify his holdings and to get some major tax savings for his accumulated capital. Before finding Allegheny, he had hired a Wall Street business broker for $18,000 a year in an unsuccessful search for a company. ''I was shown a shoe business, a lumber business, a manufacturing business,'' he said. ''I can't relate to them.'' **********Thus when he heard that the Allegheny deal with the Murchison interests might fall through, he was interested. Mr. Simmons asked Mr. Tippins a few days before Christmas whether he would come to the closing ready to buy. He said yes. **********''It's a business I know something about,'' he said. ''Its a lot better to do this than to buy some lending company or a trucking company. My life has been set in this direction.'' **********Tippins Machinery was founded by his father, L.H. Tippins, in 1923. It remained largely a small family business confined to reconditioning used mining machinery. After the son graduated from Yale in 1946 with a degree in electrical engineering he shifted the business into reconditioning rolling equipment for smaller steel mills. He has since built his company from one of about five employees and annual sales of $2 million in the 1950's to one that employs 200 with sales expected to be about $70 million this year. It has built mills in South Africa, West Germany, Britain, Italy, Mexico, Canada and the United States. **********Now Mr. Tippins is busy getting ready for a major expansion. He is going after orders to renovate the large rolling mills for major steel producers. To rebuild these mills would cost about $300 million each, he estimated. His company is offering to bring the mills up to date under a patented process for about a fourth of that cost.  Several major steel makers have expressed interest, he said. **********Mr. Tippins's investment in Allegheny has at times put him in a difficult position with other steel companies, who now see him also as a potential competitor as well as builder of mills. **********He has had to tread carefully to show that his interest in Allegheny is one of investment only.  ''My wealth has been made in the steel industry,'' he said. ''I feel an obligation to put it back. This is a long-term investment.  This is not to come in and rob and steal and then walk away from it.'' **********It is also not to look over Mr. Simmons's shoulder at Allegheny.  ''I won't tell him how to run his business,'' he said, ''and he can't tell me how to build a rolling mill.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/24/business/gulf-unit-studies-canadians-role.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gulf Unit Studies Canadians' Role", "print_headline": "Gulf Unit Studies Canadians' Role", "body_text": " **********Gulf Canada Ltd. is studying how to increase Canadian ownership of the company, a spokesman said.

The report was issued today in conjunction with the meeting of central bankers this week. **********The message this year is that the United States and other countries are relying too heavily on monetary policy in their fight against inflation. **********Ripple Effect of High Rates **********America's high interest rates are forcing other countries to defend their currencies by raising their own rates to damagingly high levels at a time of recession, the bank says. Such defense is needed because the high returns available on dollar holdings draw funds from other currencies. **********Business investment is suffering as a result, and with it, the West's chances of reducing unemployment through industrial development. Meanwhile, the developing world's economies are being crushed by the soaring cost of servicing its debt and by slack demand for its exports in the depressed economies of the West. **********The bank would like the United States and other industrial countries to take some of the upward pressure off interest rates by doing more to fight inflation by fiscal means: cutting budget deficits, loosening economic bottlenecks and persuading trade unions to limit wage demands by subscribing to voluntary incomes policies. Dangers of a Backlash **********The report conveys concern that because inflation has become ''a way of life'' in today's world, it will take a monetary squeeze of intolerable severity to halt inflation. Such a squeeze, in the bank's view, risks setting off a political backlash not just against tightmoney policies but against the Western world's commitment to making inflation-fighting its top economic priority. **********If the worldwide monetary squeeze continues, the bank fears a breakdown in international economic cooperation, as European countries rebel against the prolonged recession that the Reagan Administration's tight-money policy is seen as imposing on them. **********The bank pointedly recalls that habits of economic cooperation built up since World War II represent ''the most effective bulwark against a repetition of the kind of events witnessed in the 1930's, which ultimately resulted in the disintegration of the world economy.'' **********The report concludes ominously. ''The warning signs are written clearly on the wall,'' it says. ''The Western world is already paying a high price for having tolerated too high an inflation rate for too long. If, in the present decisive phase, confidence in the effectiveness of international cooperation were to be shaken, the price would be greater still.'' Reflects a Broad View **********Although the bank insists that Washington is not the only culprit, its thinly veiled attack on the Reagan Administration's monetarist approach to inflation-fighting echoes the increasingly strident complaints now coming from virtually all other Western countries except Britain. **********In recent weeks, European governments have told the United States that soaring American interest rates are spreading stagflation around the world, killing off hopes of an economic recovery in the West this year and raising the cost of oil and other imported raw materials that must be paid for in increasingly expensive dollars. **********Europe and the Bank for International Settlements want the United States instead to reduce inflation by cutting its budget deficit, stimulating competition and restraining pay claims, thus making room for a coordinated reduction in world interest rates that would revive the world economy. Demands Due at O.E.C.D. Meeting **********These demands will certainly be repeated by foreign and finance ministers at Tuesday's annual ministerial meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. But so far, the Reagan Administration has turned a deaf ear to such pleas, saying that world interest rates would come down as soon as American inflation subsided and not before. **********But some Western officials already fear that the O.E.C.D. meeting will provide the first signs of the kind of revolt against the West's inflation-fighting commitment that the bank fears.

In the view of the bank, the Federal Reserve's new policy of concentrating on control of the monetary base has led to wild swings in interest rates and exchange rates without making the growth of the monetary aggregates noticeably more stable. **********While acknowledging that a restrictive monetary policy is essential if inflation is to be beaten, the bank wants it to be supplemented first and foremost by a general drive to reduce government deficits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/20/business/forum-getting-the-coal-on-the-road.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Owen", "pub_date": "1981-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Forum; GETTING THE COAL ON THE ROAD", "print_headline": "Forum; GETTING THE COAL ON THE ROAD", "body_text": " **********I F the dredging of channels in a few United States ports is not begun in the next several years, American efforts to beat stagflation will be significantly hampered.  To say that this connection is not widely appreciated would be a vast understatement. But the connection is there, and unless we take account of it, we will suffer. **********The 1970's showed that sharply rising oil prices meant more inflation and less economic growth in the industrial countries. Oil prices are no longer rising steeply, in part because these countries have reacted to higher prices by reducing their oil consumption and increasing their use of alternative energy sources. **********The most important of these alternatives is coal. When the leaders of the seven main industrial countries met at the 1980 economic summit conference in Venice, they pledged their countries to double coal trade in the coming decade. Whether this pledge is fulfilled will do much to determine whether the present relative stability of oil prices continues, or fades away as the current recession wanes and unforeseen interruptions in oil supply occur. **********The obstacle to doubling coal trade is not lack of supply in the main exporting countries: The United States, Australia, Poland, and South Africa have sufficient reserves to increase enormously their production of coal for sale abroad. **********Nor is the obstacle any lag in demand: Conversion of oil-burning facilities to coal and creation of new coal burning facilities is proceeding so rapidly in Western Europe and Japan that demand for coal imports by these regions is expected to increase fourfold from 1979 to 1990. Despite present softness of the coal spot market in Europe, a very substantial long-term increase in demand remains likely. THE obstacl e to increased coal trade lies in artificial restraints in the coal e xporting nations: Unstable conditions in Poland, which have reduced its coal output; fear of interracial strife in the future and an equivocal government policy in the past, which have made importer s reluctant to rely unduly on South Africa; periodic labor difficu lties in Australia, reflected in last year's strike, andinadequate po rt facilities in the United States, which have provoked bitter compla ints from our trading partners. The problems in Poland, South Africa, and A ustralia are not susceptible to rapid resolution. So the Unite d States will remain a key residual supplier - the more so since mos t coal importers are anxious to diversify their sources of supply in order to reduce theirvulnerability to untoward events in other cou ntries. The United States role is so large as to make it unlikel y that world coal trade will be doubled unless restraints on that rol e created by inadequate ports are overcome. **********There is a good deal of misunderstanding about these restraints.  Three separate problems need to be distinguished from each other: *********** There are the short-term problems of adjustment that caused large numbers of European ships to wait long periods to load coal at United States East Coast ports last spring. These problems have been eased not only by the end of the Australian strike but also by innovative procedures that have made it possible to schedule waiting ships at our East Coast ports more efficiently and by increased coal exports from our Gulf Coast ports. *********** There is the medium-term problem of structural change: United States coal loading and storage port facilities were designed for lesser amounts than must now be moved, and were designed primarily for metallurgical coal, rather than the steam coal that is now in growing demand abroad. So these facilities must be expanded and modernized. The private companies that own the piers and the relevant port authorities are taking effective steps to these ends. *********** There is the longer-term problem of channel depths. Even if the improvements in coal loading and storage facilities described above are achieved, United States coal ports will remain inadequate, because European and Japanese coal importers want to shift some of their coal commerce from the present Panamax 60,000-ton ships to larger ships (100,000 tons and over), which can transport coal more economically. Present water depths in most world coal ports are too shallow to take these ships. Steps are being taken to remedy this condition in some European, Australian, and South African ports, but not in the United States. **********This United States lag is due to a legislative problem: The Administration has concluded that dredging should not and cannot, in present budgetary circumstances, be financed by the Federal Government. This means that a bill will have to be passed by the Congress defining how this function is to be transferred to the states and local authorities. And it has proved damnably difficult to get Congressional agreement on such a bill. Many coastal states are involved, and their immediate interests and financial capabilities differ. **********Until it is clear that a few United States coal ports will be dredged, some European and Japanese coal importers will be reluctant to sign long-term contracts to buy greatly increased amounts of American coal. In the absence of such contracts, some American companies will be reluctant to make the long-term investments needed to fulfill United States coal export potential. This will not only limit world coal trade but also hurt those Americans who make their living producing and transporting coal. **********The Administration is cutting red tape on dredging. Legislative action in the next 12 months is also needed, and is feasible. But this will require that two things occur: *********** That the Administration take the lead in seeking legislative consensus. *********** That public demand for port dredging be felt, making it easier for the members of Congress principally concerned to compromise.  Failing this, the great United States export coal boom that people talk about for the 1980's will turn out like the great United States domestic coal boom that people used to talk about for the 1970's - a dazzling vision that is only partially reflected in expanded sales of the hard black stuff that substitutes for oil. **********Without a United States coal export boom, the link between oil consumption and economic growth in the industrial world will not be broken - a link that condemns us to recurring inflation and low growth, whenever the balance between oil demand and supply tilts, as it may periodically, against the oil importing nations. **********There is an excellent chance of solving our coal port problem. But only if a lot more public attention is paid to it than is now the case.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Henry Owen, w ho was in charge of the White House coordination for President Car ter at the London, Bonn, Tokyo and Venice economic summit meetin gs, is with the Consultants International Group in Washington."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/10/business/tuesday-february-10-1981-energy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 765, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Energy", "print_headline": "TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1981; Energy", "body_text": " **********The U.S. is going to the international market to buy oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

The other companies are Gulf Minerals Canada of Toronto, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Gulf Oil Corporation, Denison Mines of Toronto, Rio Algom of Toronto, owned mostly by the Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation of London, and Uranerz Exploration and Mining Ltd. of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, a wholly owned subsidiary of Uranerzbergbau of West Germany. **********The Government accused the companies of unlawfully conspiring to act with 21 persons and companies in Canada and abroad between 1970 and 1978 ''to prevent or lessen unduly competition in production, manufacture, purchase, sale and supply in Canada'' of uranium, uranium oxide and other uranium substances. **********Among the persons named but not indicted as conspirators were J.C.

Formation of Cartel **********The international uranium cartel was formed by Canada, Australia, France, South Africa and Rio Tinto after a ban by the United States on uranium imports in the late 1960's led to a sharp drop in uranium prices.

The move is also giving larger securities firms a further advantage over their smaller competitors, which are not eligible for the cut-rate loans. **********The interest rates that brokerage houses charge their customers to finance the purchase of securities on credit are tied to the brokerloan rate. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, for example, brokerage firms are required to charge their customers at least one-half percentage point more than the broker-loan rate on their margin accounts. **********As a result of the new pricing procedures, the larger brokerage firms have been able to obtain broker loans from banks at discounts greater than a full percentage point below the posted rate. Morgan Largest Lender **********''It's questionable whether we'll continue to have anything that can be called a 'broker-loan' rate,'' says Earle N. Cutler 3d, vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, the single biggest bank lender to securities firms. **********''We do get money from banks below the broker-loan rate from time to time,'' Joseph P. Matorella, a money manager at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said. **********He added that Kidder, Peabody was not a big borrower of broker loans but that, when it borrowed in recent weeks, it found that money was readily available below the posted rates. ''This was the first week that we took advantage of the lower rate from Chase,'' he added. The Chase Manhattan Bank is a leading lender to brokerage firms. **********Three other leading securities firms acknowledged privately this week that they had been obtaining broker loans below the posted rate, but they asked not to be quoted. **********Some of the major firms obtain their funds primarily from nonbank sources and borrow little from banks. Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's largest securities firm, raises most of its money in the commercial-paper market, where rates are usually lower than even the cut-rate bank loans. Discounts Not Passed On **********The situation is sensitive because brokerage firms are not passing the discounts on to their customers, who continue to pay interest rates scaled up from the posted broker-loan rate. These customers are charged anywhere from one-half percentage point to two and a half percentage points above the posted broker-loan rate. **********Income from such loans has been a major source of earnings for many brokerage firms. The total amount of margin-account lending by brokerage firms to their customers amounted to $14.7 billion at yearend, according to the Federal Reserve Bulletin. **********In 1980, for instance, Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, one of the nation's largest securities firms, earned $52 million before taxes on its margin accounts, compared with its net after-tax income of only $26.8 million. **********Among the commercial banks, only Morgan was willing to publicly acknowledge that it had been making broker loans below its posted rates. At least four other of the nation's ten largest banks privately confirmed that they had been engaging in such practices, however. **********For the last month and a half, Morgan has been testing a program under which it tailors its rate on broker loans to its overall relationship with the borrower, Mr. Cutler said. The program has gone well and will soon be introduced to all its customers, he added. **********Other banks are offering broker-loan discounts in a more haphazard way, depending on the amount of funds they have available on any particular day and the trend of interest rates. The loans are priced in relation to the rate on Federal funds, money that banks buy and sell among themselves. Recently, many broker loans have been made at only a quarter of a percentage point above the Federal funds rate. **********Yesterday, according to Mr. Matorella of Kidder, Peabody, the posted broker-loan rate ranged from 14 1/2 percent to 15 percent, while Federal funds were trading around 13 percent. In periods of rapidly declining interest rates, as at present, it becomes easier to get broker loans below the posted rate, he said. **********Aside from Morgan, other banks particularly active in the market include the Irving Trust Company, the Bankers Trust Company, the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Chemical Bank. **********The firms being offered the discounts are those that can borrow large amounts, according to the bankers. Bankers say it is not worthwhile lending smaller amounts at discounts because overhead on smaller loans reduces the net return to a rate lower than that obtainable in the Federal funds market. **********Each day banks formally post the basic rate they charge on broker loans. On Tuesday, several banks announced they had lowered their broker-loan rates to 16 percent from 16 1/2 percent. **********Yet, as a result of the ''tiering'' that has emerged, one securities firm said on Tuesday that it had obtained broker loans at rates as low as 15 percent. **********The tiering has resulted from growing competition, especially from foreign bank branches and agencies in New York and from banks outside New York."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/04/business/economic-scene-will-history-repeat-itself.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1981-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Will History Repeat Itself?", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Will History Repeat Itself?", "body_text": " **********COULD another Great Depression like that of the 1930's happen now?  Many economists think it was the worldwide liquidity crisis of 1931 that turned the recession of 1929-30 into the worst depression in history. **********What brought on the liquidity crisis of 1931? According to Maurice W. Lee, Boshamer Distinguished Professor of Economics at the University of North Carolina, these were the key factors: **********- An unmanageable amount of consumer installment debt. **********- A heavy burden of agricultural mortgage debt, dating back to the land boom caused by inflation during World War I. **********- A mountain of home mortgage debt resulting from the suburban land boom of the 1920's. **********- A huge pyramid of business debt built on a thin equity base. **********- A critical mass of international borrowing resting on a continuing flow of credit from the United States.  By the end of the 1920's, the American economy - indeed the world economy - was operating, Professor Lee says, like a huge chain letter: ''As long as the chain was not broken, as long as new infusions of credit kept the circular flow moving, the 'prosperity decade' could continue.'' **********But the stock market crash of 1929 caused American companies to pull back on their foreign loans. And the Smoot-Hawley tariff chopped United States imports, slashing foreign countries' earnings. As their economies foundered, they imposed trade barriers of their own, and United States exports also sank. **********The collapse of the Credit Anstalt in Austria threatened the German banks, which rushed to liquidate their holdings in London and Paris.  The whole international banking structure began to fall apart. **********How does the present situation compare to 1931? One brighter element stressed by Professor Lee is that consumers have been monitoring their use of credit more carefully. Measured against income, their debt burdens do not look critical, although they are high by historical standards. ''However,'' he says, ''the consumer's situation could become critical if unemployment rises or personal income declines.'' **********But the debt burden on nonfinancial corporations, he notes, has reached very high levels, just as corporate profits are sagging, and the failure rate among smaller businesses is rising sharply. Savings rates are low and lendable funds for long-term investment are short. **********The great amount of short-term debt waiting to be refinanced in the long-term market, he contends, sets a floor under long-term rates ''every bit as strong as the often-remarked forces that give us an embedded inflation rate.'' **********High mortgage rates have driven housing sales and new housing construction to its lowest level of the postwar period. And those high rates are jeopardizing the survival of many savings banks and other thrift institutions. **********Prof. Franco Modigliani of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a former president of the American Economic Association, said in a telephone interview this week: ''It is long past time when the Government should do something to rescue the thrift institutions. They were told to borrow short and lend long, and they got caught. Since the Government pushed them into it, the Government has some responsibility to get them out of it.'' **********Could another international monetary breakdown, like the one that followed the collapse of the Credit Anstalt in 1931, occur now?  Professor Modigliani says he is ''frankly worried - it's a very delicate situation.'' He feels that more government regulation of foreign lending by private banks is needed, and that central banks have not yet provided adequate assurances that, in a crisis, they could and would function as ''lenders of last resort'' to prevent an international banking breakdown. **********With the piling up of debts, domestically and internationally, the classic conditions for a serious systemic breakdown appear to exist.  In pressing hard for financial growth, decade after decade, the United States and the rest of the world seem once more to have created a huge ''chain letter'' -a process that could collapse, with devastating effects on output, income and employment, if the flow of credit were cut off. **********But to keep the chain letter growing, with credit mounting higher and higher, would add to the dangers of worse inflation and a still more serious collapse later. **********How to escape from this dilemma will be considered in another column. Perhaps the most hopeful aspect of the present situation, to reverse the dictum of the philosopher George Santayana, is that we do remember the crisis of 1931 and are not condemned by ignorance to repeat it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/07/world/no-headline-121116.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********AROUND THE WORLD; Salvador Prelate Assails 'Repression' of Junta **********SAN SALVADOR, Dec. 6 (UPI) - Msgr.

In effect, he has had three political careers, and the first two were unremarkable and not very successful. **********His triumph today, in American terms, would be remotely as if Harold E. Stassen had returned to public life 10 years ago, become a Democrat, revitalized the party and won last November's Presidential election. Served in Many Cabinets **********Francois Mitterrand - his name is pronounced frahn-SWAH mee-terr-AHN - was one of the blur of people moving in and out of offices in the postwar Fourth Republic, whose governments rose and fell irregularly, but often. A member of various small centrist or centerleft groupings whose names not even the French remember, he was caught up in the political moves of the time: backing the Suez invasion of 1956, affirming that the only policy to be followed toward the Algerian nationalists was war and participating dutifully in the nonstop process of political intrigues and swaps that came to be called the Waltz of the Cabinets. **********When Gen. Charles de Gaulle was called back in 1958 to disband the Fourth Republic and set up the Fifth, Mr. Mitterrand stepped out of the shuffle. Unlike other political figures who hastened to join the general, he became one of his most persistent opponents, and in 1965 he participated in the first of three presidential campaigns as the candidate of the left. He did well, but lost, and for the next five years seemed ready to retire. **********Then, in 1971, after the Socialist Party had dropped to an abysmal 5 percent of the vote, a conference was held to decide its future.  Mr. Mitterrand turned up with a proposal for a united left that might some day wrench the Fifth Republic from what seemed to be the perpetual control of the right. The vision seemed precarious, and Mr. Mitterrand did not even belong to the party: nevertheless, there were no better ideas around, so he was made a party member and the party leader all at the same time. **********If he had lost to Valery Giscard d'Estaing today, as he did seven years ago, he would still have accomplished something remarkable.  From its lowest ebb in history, he built the Socialist Party up to the greatest strength it has known. The Communists dropped to 15 percent of the electorate in the first round of the elections two weeks ago, and the Socialists grew to 26 percent. **********The man who has done this remains, nonetheless, a puzzle to most of the French and a source of distrust to many of them. Part of both the puzzlement and the distrust is political. His enemies call him an opportunist or worse, while his admirers see a man of private and idiosyncratic loyalty to his own sense of the authentic. Antipolitical Qualities **********His demeanor is both cool and elusive; he cultivates, perhaps deliberately, antipolitical qualities. Not long ago he visited, for the third time in a few years, the same small town in the Limousin district of south central France. The local Socialist leader, who had received him each time, asked him to autograph a book. ''What is your name?'' Mr. Mitterrand inquired, reaching for a pen. **********It was not that he just forgot the name; it was that he obviously attached no importance to remembering it. In 1971, after he had become the Socialist leader, a party official came up to him. ''So, Francois, now we can use 'tu,' '' the official boomed out in broad Gascon tones. ''Comme vous voulez'' - ''As you wish'' - Mr.  Mitterrand replied, holding to the formal usage. **********Mr. Mitterrand has written several books of political and literary essays, and has a gift for observation and for perceptive phrases.  There is something of a literary quality to the public figure he presents to the French. In contrast to the brisk activism of Mr.  Giscard d'Estaing, the sense that each moment is the morning and can be taken up clean, Mr. Mitterrand is all late afternoon. Escaped From German Prison **********Francois Maurice Mitterrand was born on Oct. 26, 1916, at Jarnac in southwestern France. He was educated at the University of Paris and has degrees in law, letters and political science. He was wounded in World War II and taken prisoner by the Germans, but escaped and joined the underground. **********At the age of 64 and, if anything, an intellectual, he tramps about in a bargeman's cap, an overcoat and several scarves, suggesting an old countryman, slow, tempered and attached to the land. ''Inspector Maigret,'' one commentator called him. ''He doesn't so much travel about France as plow it,'' wrote another. He is the candidate of the left but, much as his old adversary de Gaulle used to do, and as Mr.  Giscard d'Estaing decidedly does not, he presents himself as France's roots. **********Clearly his mournful visage, his slow speech, his air of taking thought, suggest a kind of authenticity, a refusal of gimmickry, that he has employed to show up the more mechanical showmanship of Mr.  Giscard d'Estaing. Is it a gimmick itself? There are those, including some in his own party, who think so. **********Mr. Mitterrand does not reveal himself to many. He has close friends, a wife, the former Danielle Gouze, and two grown sons, with whom he spends time, whenever possible, at a modest country retreat in the Landes region of the southwest, where he tramps the pine woods by day and writes in the evenings. But there are not many French people, including those who voted for him, who are confident that they know what he is like. **********When they do, it is mainly as an intuition. ''There is a pessimism about Mitterrand that I feel each time he speaks on television,'' the novelist Marguerite Duras, who supports him, wrote recently. ''It is an essential pessimism that is common to us all. It is the end of lying.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/30/world/soviet-aide-ends-visit-to-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Aide Ends Visit to Britain", "print_headline": "Soviet Aide Ends Visit to Britain", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Deputy Foreign Trade Minister, Vladimir N.

Now she does the same thing from a bedroom in her house in Columbia, S.C., using a terminal connected to the office's computer by telephone. **********Like Mrs. Priester, a small but growing number of workers are doing office work at home on small computers or terminals with typewriter keyboards. Corporations encourage the practice, to save commuting time for their employees and to recruit some workers, such as mothers of small children, who might not be able to hold conventional jobs. **********Working at home gives employees more flexibility in scheduling other activities.  ''I can get up when I want to and work when I want to,'' said Mrs.  Priester, adding that she can now take better care of her elderly mother. **********Companies and workers say the new system can transform relationships between co-workers, between employees and employers and between workers and their families. **********''What we're really talking about is returning production to the home, which is where it was before the Industrial Revolution,'' said Alvin Toffler, author of the book ''The Third Wave,'' in an interview. Although Mr. Toffler is dismissed by many as an unrealistic visionary, he has drawn attention to working at home with a phrase, ''the electronic cottage.'' **********People have always worked at home, of course. Nearly 2.6 million people, or 3.2 percent of the United States labor force, worked at home in 1975, according to the latest figures available from the Census Bureau. More than one-third of them were farmers, and many of the rest were in business for themselves. What electronics can do is extend that option to more people in a diversity of occupations, including employees of large corporations. **********Some see working at home as part of a trend in which telecommunications, growing more sophisticated, replaces transportation, growing more expensive because of rising energy costs. **********In an experiment in Knoxville, Tenn., people bank electronically without leaving home. Others elsewhere in the nation shop electronically from home. In Columbus, Ohio, people can use two-way cable television to vote at home. And business people, instead of traveling to other cities, can now hold meetings in which they see as well as hear colleagues across the nation. **********These new activities are called teleshopping and teleconferencing.  Working at home has been dubbed telecommuting.  So far, the number of full-time telecommuters is small. There are probably hundreds of them nationwide. They are confined to jobs that lend themselves to solitary effort: writers, typists and computer programmers. Thousands of others in various jobs, including corporate executives, do extra work at home on personal computers or terminals.  Programmers' Tasks **********The Control Data Corporation, the Minneapolis computer company, has 60 of its 48,000 United States employees, mostly computer programmers, working at home. The Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in Chicago recently hired four persons to transcribe recorded dictation in their homes and transmit the text to office computers. **********Other concerns, including the Aetna Life and Casualty Companies, the North American Life Insurance Company and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, are studying similar programs. **********The FMC Corporation in Chicago, while requiring workers to come to the office during the day, has installed terminals in the homes of four programmers. They are on call at night to handle computer breakdowns. **********''They used to get a phone call, hop in their car, take 45 minutes getting to the office, 15 minutes solving the problem and 45 minutes driving home,'' said Robert A. Copella, FMC's manager of manufacturing systems. Now the programmers can solve the problem in their pajamas. **********Work at home is done on terminals, word processors or computers that cost several thousand dollars. The devices either print out data on paper or display it on a television screen. Role of Phone Varies **********In some cases, the terminal must be continuously linked by telephone with a central computer. In other cases, terminals and word processors have their own computing capacity. The worker uses the phone only to transmit the final work to the central computer. **********Home typists for Continental Illinois record dictation off the telephone. They type the text and edit it on computer screens. Then they dial a special number, put the telephone receiver in a cradle and transmit the completed text over the phone line to the bank's computer. **********Employees have mixed feelings about working at home. Although it gives them more freedom, it removes them from the social life of the office. Some think their fellow workers or supervisors mistrust those who work at home. **********''I still think there's a mentality around here that people who work at home are not working,'' said the vice president of a New York-based management consulting firm who works out of his home in Florida. His house contains a small computer, a word processor and a printer, allowing him to prepare reports. **********''I like to have uninterrupted periods to work alone,'' he said.  ''If I have to stop and go to a meeting for two hours, I lose more than two hours.'' Special Arrangement **********He concedes that he was able to work out such an arrangement only because of his stature in the firm, and he asked that his name not be used because the management did not want other employees to know about the setup. **********John Pistacchi of Control Data, who last year worked at his home in San Jose, Calif., found that his business associates hesitated to call him because they did not want to disturb him at home, even though they knew he was working there. **********Some people could not work at all except at home.  ''I have a small child and don't have to get a baby-sitter,'' said Terry Medlin of Columbia, S.C., one of Blue Cross-Blue Shield's four ''cottage keyers.'' **********Mrs. Medlin said, however, that working at home ''gets kind of lonesome some of the time.'' The hardest part, she said, is ''putting yourself on a schedule.'' **********Being with one's family can be an advantage, but it can also be a distraction. David A. Pimley, a Control Data employee in Sunnyvale, Calif, who worked at home last year, said his daughter continued to go to a neighbor's house after school, even if her father was at home. ''I was there to work, not to baby-sit,'' Mr. Pimley said. A Portable Terminal **********Vincent E. Giuliano, who works for Arthur D. Little Inc., the Cambridge, Mass., consulting concern, uses a portable terminal that allows him to work not only from his home but also from a cottage in New Hampshire or from a motel while on business trips. **********Working at home can give handicapped people a chance at employment they would not otherwise have.  Lift Inc., a nonprofit organization based in Northbrook, Ill., has trained about 30 handicapped workers who now write computer programs from their homes for companies such as the Standard Oil Company (Indiana), the First National Bank of Chicago and Montgomery Ward & Company. **********Some of the handicapped workers operate the keyboard with sticks strapped to their hands. In a compromise between saving commuting time and retaining workers' contact with others, some companies have opened neighborhood offices and allowed employees to work at the one closest to home. Control Data will soon open such a center for 55 workers. **********The Southern New England Telephone Company tested a remote business center in 1978. The center, in Meriden, Conn., 15 miles from company headquarters in New Haven, was equipped with phones, facsimile machines and message-handling terminals. Feeling of Isolation **********Yet the four workers at the remote center felt isolated. Among other things, they had trouble obtaining files from the central office. **********''Being away from the home area was almost like the old cliche 'out of sight, out of mind,' '' said Anthony J. Francalangia, a planner who worked at the remote office. **********Work-at-home programs can save corporations the cost of expanding office space in expensive downtown areas and can allow them to recruit workers who otherwise would not be available. This is especially important for jobs where qualified workers are in short supply - secretaries and computer programmers, for instance. **********''The industry is starving for computer talent, so we make available a resource that is hidden from the market,'' said Leah L.  Tracy, branch manager of Heights Information Technology Service Inc.  This data processing consulting company, with offices in Tarrytown, N.Y., and Oakland, Calif., employs 180 persons who write programs, mainly at home. **********Yet many companies balk at the idea because having employees work at home raises problems. It requires new ways of making sure that an employee puts in a full day's work. **********''A lot of companies are really conservative about this,'' said Margrethe Olson, an assistant professor at the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration, who is studying work-athome programs. ''They want those employees in sight.'' Output Quotas Set **********Blue Cross-Blue Shield of South Carolina and Continental Illinois both require a certain minimum daily output from their clerical workers who stay at home. Other companies restrict work at home to salaried employees who are judged by output, not hours worked. **********Companies must also decide if they save money by having employees stay home.  Blue Cross-Blue Shield has found that its cottage keyers process claims less expensively than its office keyers. But that is because the cottage keyers get no fringe benefits and must pay for their own terminals, paper and phone bills - at a cost of $2,640 a year. **********Technological problems can arise. At Continental Illinois, occasional computer breakdowns prevent home typists from sending in their finished text. The taped dictation has to be sent back over the phone and transcribed in the bank. **********If working at home catches on, the long-term effects could be widespread, according to Mr. Toffler and Charles C. McClintock, a psychologist in the College of Human Ecology at Cornell University, who is studying the phenomenon. **********When work is done at home, they said, family members can share a job and can work for more than one company. Distance Unimportant **********Data can be transmitted long distance as well as locally, so there is little need for workers to be in the same city as their employer. **********When a person gets a new job, instead of moving, he or she may merely ''plug into a different line,'' Mr. Toffler said.  No one expects the office or factory to disappear. Too many jobs require face-to-face meetings. This may bar full work-at-home programs. **********''There are not that many types of white-collar or blue-collar jobs that can be done on a lonely basis,'' said Kenneth G. Bosomworth, president of International Resource and Development Inc., a consulting concern that studies office automation. ''What you end up with is a scenario in which only 1 or 2 percent of the work force can commute in this way.'' **********Jack M. Nilles, director of interdisciplinary programs at the University of Southern California, is more optimistic. He estimates that 15 percent of the urban work force may work at home by 1990. **********But Dr. Nilles, a proponent of telecommuting, finds it hard to practice what he preaches because meetings require him to come to campus at least four times a week. **********''If I could schedule the rest of the university better, I wouldn't have to,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/20/world/no-headline-100216.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********AROUND THE WORLD; Guatemala to Draft Peasants to Fight Rebels **********GUATEMALA, Nov. 19 (AP) - Hundreds of peasants will be drafted into the military reserve to fight a growing leftist guerrilla threat, the army chief of staff, Benedicto Lucas Garcia, said today. **********The army chief, brother of President Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia, said the draft would be centered in Quiche Province, where he said peasants ''have asked to fight against subversion because of damages caused to their communities.'' **********The Government has about 3,000 reservists, part of its 18,000-member armed forces, against four Marxist groups that have 2,000 to 4,000 guerrillas in the western and central highlands. ---- **********GENEVA, Nov. 19 (Reuters) - The International Labor Organization called on the Guatemalan Government today to act to put an end to a wave of murders of trade union leaders.

Before his weekly audiences in the square, he stands in the vehicle as it winds through the crowds. The act is a byproduct of his instinctive showmanship and his irrepressible desire to bring the church to the people. **********Whether his efforts have been applauded or criticized, John Paul has made the world pay attention to the church. He is a subject of great contentiousness as a leader, but he has remained personally popular to all sides in disputes and has gained a reputation for bending decorum and playing to crowds. Took Nine Major Trips **********The Pope has undertaken nine major trips in his mission of evangelization, a concept that includes not only the preaching of the Gospel as an alternative to ideologies such as Marxism but also the advocacy of the rights of the poor and oppressed. Repeatedly he has warned Roman Catholics against using violence to erase injustice.  ''Violence,'' he said during his trip to Brazil, ''kills what it intends to create.'' **********Elected to the papacy on Oct. 16, 1978, he promised ''a ministry of love,'' and he has plunged into the world scene with a sense of fearless resolve and tireless devotion. **********On his trips, he has thrived on schedules that most of his aides find exhausting. Though an intensely private man, he has a knack for stirring crowds - wandering into their midst, donning the hats worn by local people, often speaking in the local language and reaching out to touch hands. **********Some of his aides have been nervous about this informality and the risks he takes, but the Pope has shown that he will exercise his right to conduct the papacy as he sees fit. His reign centers on a conviction that he must assert the authority of the office to restore stability to a church shaken by the reforms of the Second Vatican Council of the 1960's. Further, never shrinking from his role as an international leader, he believes he must aggressively confront secular creeds that compete with the church for the loyalties and affections of people. **********His courage has been formidable in the face of conflicts he has sparked in his attempt to create unity in Catholic belief and practice. He has warned Catholics against further experimentation in worship, insisted that the church's opposition to divorce and artificial birth control must be upheld and approved the censuring of the Rev. Hans Kung, a Swiss theologian who disagrees with the Vatican's teaching on papal infallibility. **********On his journeys, he has tried to impart to Catholics a sense of love and respect for the church even while he has sometimes scolded its clergy for getting too involved in politics and lectured Catholic families about the need to remain unwaveringly committed to the church's teachings on morality. He has been a father figure without apologies and a firm disciplinarian. Reaching Paris, for instance, he declared chidingly: ''France, eldest daughter of the church, are you faithful to the promises of your baptism?'' Yearning to Meet People **********More than any Pope in history, John Paul has a yearning to see his far-flung congregation in its various surroundings.  ''The journeys of the Pope to the different continents and countries of the world all have one characteristic in common,'' the Pope said in Ghana in May 1980. ''The visits are always too short.'' **********He has traveled to underdeveloped nations, where his own beliefs about the relations between church and state have been tested and have undergone some change. On his first venture in early 1979 to Mexico, he projected some ambiguity by warning priests to stay out of politics but responding with compassion and encouragement to lay people who are struggling for human rights. Dedicated to Human Rights **********By the time he visited Brazil in July of last year, he was still pronouncing a hard line between Marxism and Christianity but siding more with elements of the church that are striving to correct injustice. His dedication to human rights was expressed most dramatically when he pleaded for justice in the presence of President Ferdinand E. Marcos on a journey to the Philippines last February. **********In his speeches and sermons, the Pope has made it clear that his efforts are rooted in devotion to Christ. The key to his first encyclical, ''Redemptor Hominis,'' or ''Christ the Redeemer of Man,'' was that concern for human life springs from the love of Christ, a thought summed up in his reference to ''the relation between Christ's redemption and human dignity.'' **********With that conviction at the core of his mission, he has become a preacher of salvation and human rights to millions in distant parts of the earth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/15/business/zaire-diamond-sales-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ZAIRE DIAMOND SALES PLAN", "print_headline": "ZAIRE DIAMOND SALES PLAN", "body_text": " **********Antwerp,Belgium, May 14(Reuter)-Zaire has ended its exclusive diamond sales contract with De BEers Consolidated Mines Ltd's Central Selling Organization, a dealer, David Susskind, said today.

But telephone calls to the Voice of Lebanon have themselves been among the confusing elements over the last few days, and Mr. Mohaisen's fate still seems uncertain. **********It was widely assumed here that the abductors were operating on behalf of Syria.

Bogner had made its fortune by revolutionizing ski clothing. It took skiers out of their fluffy sweaters and baggy knickers and put them into sleek wedge-shaped pants and trim anoraks. **********But now, with West Germany under a cloud of recession, with the sportswear market flooded with competitors and with Bogner in the middle of a fickle fashion market, the company's executives are more likely to be looking hopefully for shifts in the business climate. **********Although Bogner remains a synomym for skiwear from Chamonix to St.  Moritz and from Squaw Valley to Sapporo, the company has not been spared by the recession, said Willy Bogner, son of the company's founder and its top executive. An Olympic skier like his father, the younger Willy skied for West Germany at Squaw Valley in 1960 and at Innsbruck in 1964. In his spare time Mr. Bogner, tanned and still boyish-looking at 39, shoots ski films. He did ski chases for three James Bond movies. The Outlook for Sales **********This year's sales, Mr. Bogner said, are expected to rise between 7 and 10 percent, to about 175 million marks, the equivalent of $75 million. But after allowing for inflation, he conceded, that means a real drop of roughly 5 percent. The volume has steadily climbed - from 123 million marks in 1978 to 145 million marks in 1979 to 160 million marks in 1980. **********The company publishes no figures on earnings, but Mr. Bogner said its healthy profit margin of about 7 percent, enjoyed in years past, was down considerably. **********To counter the slide, Bogner plans to invest in a new type of retailing network, so-called Bogner Houses, which sell exclusively Bogner products. Three of these already exist in Munich, Cologne and Hamburg, and more are planned in other Western European cities and New York. **********Unlike numerous competitors, who were swept away by new trends and inexpensive imports, Bogner moved early into high fashion, established itself overseas and entered the high-priced market for better-made clothes. Such decisions helped bring it annual growth rates of 20 to 30 percent during the 1970's. A Formula for Success **********''I think there were two things - the move to activewear and our decision to trade up,'' said Mr. Bogner, in explaining the company's success of recent years. ''But when you're successful you have many imitators: the big concerns, the department stores.'' **********Bogner markets its products primarily through specialty sporting goods stores and women's and men's apparel shops. In Europe it avoids chain stores and department stores, and in the United States it selects only a few of the best. **********Bogner's success bucked the trend in West Germany's apparel industry, where high manufacturing costs, new fashion trends from overseas and low-priced imports from Asia wiped out 130,000 of 400,000 jobs in the last 10 years. **********Innovation had been a source of Bogner's success ever since Willy Bogner, the company's founder, brought back skis, ski clothing and ski accessories from Scandinavia, where he worked in the early 1930's. He was an Olympic skier at Garmisch-Parten Kirchen in 1936.  On the slopes, he tested products his wife designed. Designs Tha t Caught On **********Mrs. Bogner created the basic wedge-shaped pants (called ''Bogners'' by some American skiers) and the light anorak, the hooded jacket that was to revolutionize ski apparel. In the 1950's light stretch materials, enabling a nearly skin-tight but elastic fit, sleeker forms and less wind resistance, led to further refinements. **********Later, to bridge the slow summer months, Mrs. Bogner began designing the collection of women's wear. Originally inspired by rustic Bavarian fashions, it evolved into a high-fashion collection her son cha ra cterizes as ''uncomplicated, very practical clothing.'' **********But the real spurt of growth, annual sales jumps of 20 and 30 percent, came in the 1960's and 1970's as Europeans and Americans discovered sports dress for everyday use and the market for what the apparel industry came to call activewear ballooned. **********Women's wear now accounts for about 65 percent of Bogner's total sales. Sports apparel, including clothing for skiing, tennis and hiking, accounts for 20 percent and men's wear 15 percent. **********Bogner began selling skiwear in the United States after World War II. By 1973, with sales vigorous and the West German mark strengthening, the company set up Bogner of America, a subsidiary. It is headed by Mr. Bogner's younger brother, Michael. Building Markets Abroad **********Bogner's first overseas plant was built in Newport, Vt. Later one was constructed on the Mediterranean island of Malta. **********About 85 percent of Bogner's production is absorbed by the West German market, while exports account for 15 percent. Four-fifths of the exports go to Western European countries, with the United States getting most of the rest. (Items sold in America are largely made there.) Some shipments go to South Africa and Australia. **********Bogner feels that most of its future growth will come from abroad, and Japan is a prime prospect. For the Japanese market, companies in Japan now make goods there under license from Bogner. Its ski collection is sold in Japan, and there are plans to add women's and men's wear. **********Coupled with its move into nonsports attire, Bogner also decided to trade up by producing expensive, high-quality apparel with concentration on details and quality. Bogner left the rest of the market to inexpensive Far Eastern imports. The company felt it could not compete against these because of West Germany's relatively high cost of labor and materials."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/21/business/culbro-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-sept-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CULBRO CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "print_headline": "CULBRO CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Sept 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/17/business/chevron-deal-in-india.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chevron Deal in India", "print_headline": "Chevron Deal in India", "body_text": " **********The Indian Government intends to sign a contract with Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc. for exploration and development of a promising offshore oilfield, the oil ministry said today.

The first press reports did not contain Mr. Suzuki's subsequent interpretation at a news briefing saying that Japan could do little to increase defense spending. **********Military Activity Restricted **********The Japanese say their Constitution requires that military activities be strictly self-defensive. Before going to the United States, Mr. Suzuki said that there was not yet a consensus in Japan that would permit the sort of enhanced military efforts the United States seemed to be seeking. **********(In Washington, the State Department described the change as a domestic matter that would not affect relations between Japan and the United States.) **********Mr. Suzuki has been attacked by the press for his handling of the crisis, and the Asahi newspaper says in an editorial in tomorrow's issue: ''This Prime Minister's lack of leadership is now clear.'' **********Mr. Ito, in a brief statement, said he was leaving the Government ''to take responsibility for the way the communique was announced and related confusion after Prime Minister Suzuki returned from Washington.'' **********A last-minute effort was made by Mr. Suzuki today to dissuade Mr.  Ito from resigning when the Prime Minister sent Kiichi Miyazawa, the chief Cabinet secretary, to the Foreign Ministry to patch over the rift. The move failed. **********The new Foreign Minister, Mr. Sonoda, 67 years old, previously served as Health and Welfare Minister in the Suzuki Cabinet. He was Foreign Minister from 1977 to 1979 and is highly regarded by American officials. **********The dispute over the communique stemmed from the fact that advance copies were given to Japanese reporters in Washington to meet late edition deadlines in Japan, but not allowing time for the Prime Minister to brief the press on his interpretation of the communique. **********As a result, Japanese morning papers on May 9, the day after a second Reagan-Suzuki meeting, emphasized literal aspects of the communique, including a new stress on ''alliance'' between the United States and Japan, which was read as having a military meaning. **********The press did not immediatey carry Mr. Suzuki's account of the meeting, in which the Prime Minister emphasized that Japan could do little to increase its defense spending. **********The resulting confusion over the meaning of the Suzuki-Reagan talks went on all this week. On Tuesday, Mr. Suzuki told two former Prime Ministers, Takeo Miki and Takeo Fukuda, of his displeasure with the Foreign Ministry for the way the communique was handled. Criticism From Foreign Ministry **********Foreign Ministry officials privately ridiculed the Prime Minister for a lack of experience in foreign affairs and for having criticized a communique that he had read beforehand. Mr. Suzuki countered with attacks in the Cabinet that were publicized against Mr. Ito's wishes. **********The disputed passages in the communique referred to ''the alliance between Japan and the United States ... built upon their shared values of democracy'' and also called for ''an appropriate division of (defense) roles between Japan and the United States.'' **********The Japanese press and opposition groups charged that Mr. Suzuki had reneged on his promises not to agree to raise defense spending in response to United States pressures, and right-wing members of Mr.  Suzuki's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, who favor rearmament, quietly rejoiced over the confusion. **********According to the Prime Minister's aides, Japanese public opinion lost sight of what Mr. Suzuki said he told Mr. Reagan at their second meeting on May 8. According to the aides at a Washington briefing, Mr. Suzuki listed four reasons why Japan could not raise defense spending much from $11 billion in the fiscal 1981 budget running from April 1. **********The reasons were: Public opinion does not favor a sizable rise in the defense budget; the Government plans an overall squeeze on the national budget; the Government has other priorities in spending as well; an increase in arms spending would alarm Japan's Asian neighbors. **********The communique, however, states: ''Japan, on its own initiative and in accordance with its Constitution and basic defense policy, will seek to make ever greater efforts for improving its defense capabilities in Japanese territories and in its surrounding sea and air space.'' **********Western diplomats said that Mr. Suzuki had read the communique before he signed it and that there was no explanation of how he hoped that the Japanese press would interpret the communique in a sense different from the one it implied. ---- U.S. Calls It an Internal matter Special to the New York Times **********WASHINGTON, May 16 - The State Department today called the resignation of Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ito a purely domestic matter that would not affect relations between the two nations. **********''It's purely a Japanese internal affair, and does not affect U.S.-Japan relations,'' a statement said in response to question from Japanese reporters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/16/world/for-salvador-peasants-fruits-of-change-seem-good.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Schumacher", "pub_date": "1981-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOR SALVADOR PEASANTS, FRUITS OF CHANGE SEEM GOOD", "print_headline": "FOR SALVADOR PEASANTS, FRUITS OF CHANGE SEEM GOOD", "body_text": " **********When Government soldiers came a year ago and claimed the plantation here on behalf of the peasants, one of the first things the peasants did was to vote out the administrators. **********If was not that they particularly disliked the former owner, or even some of his administrators. For them, it was a new start.  ''Now we are all equals,'' said Mateos de Jesus Vega, the elected vice president of the assembly formed by the peasants, ''and if there is a problem, we can solve it ourselves.'' **********Los Lagartos, 30 miles west of San Salvador, is one of the 282 cooperatives formed by the Government last year in a land redistribution program designed to undercut the power of right-wing landowners and win the hearts and minds of the peasants away from leftist guerrillas. All farms over 1,250 acres were expropriated and turned over to the peasants who worked them. Cooperatives Called a Success **********A year later, the cooperatives are being termed a success. More than 260,000 people - 10 to 15 percent of the rural population - live and work on the farms. The harvests just completed were about as big as those last year under the former owners, according to Western and Salvadoran experts. **********At Los Lagartos, where peasants say the harvest was actually up, the reasons appear elementary.  ''We are more conscientious in our work,'' said Jose Luis Oriana, a 27-year-old farm worker. ''We know who we are working for.'' Los Lagartos is a typical plantation village. Its 3,000 people live in dirt huts surrounded by dirt yards filled with tropical shade trees and unkept bougainvilleas. **********The main dirt road leads to a cluster of wooden buildings in a small dirt square. One building houses the farm offices and another is the town hall, where once every two weeks an old Mexican movie is shown. Church's Doors Are Closed **********A plain plaster church also sits on the square, but its doors are usually closed. There is no priest; one comes from nearby towns on special occasions. **********Across the road, under the shade of a sprawling amate tree, a man sells slices of watermelon to children wearing wide-brimmed hats to block the burning sun. **********The village sits in the middle of an 8,000-acre farm. Almost every man and woman, and many of the children, work either in the fields, where coffee, sugar, corn and beans are grown, or in the sheds as carpenters, bricklayers, mechanics and general laborers. **********The system under the former owner was virtually feudal. The owner paid the men the minimum agricultural wage of $2.08 a day and the women $1.86. Today, the women earn the men's former pay and the men have been given a raise to $2.40 a day. **********As before, medical care primary education is free, as are tortillas and beans, the basic diet, three times a day. The food is cooked communally in huge vats and wood-burning ovens in the plantation kitchen. Profits to Be Reinvested **********The biggest change is that the 506 adults who are members of the cooperative each own an equal piece of the farm. They expect to make a profit this year, but have decided to reinvest the money. **********''We are just beginning,'' said Jose Roberto Calderon, a young general laborer. ''We still lack a lot.'' Some of the profits will go for new housing, small prefabricated homes that the Government will help build and that will introduce many of the peasants to indoor plumbing. The village now has electricity but no running water. **********The cooperative is fortunate in being able to afford the housing.  The former owner was more generous than many; he took with him only the furniture in his home, known as the ''Great House,'' leaving behind the farm equipment. Many cooperatives are having to use their profits to buy equipment. **********Future profits will also go toward paying the Government for the land. The Government has still not set a price or paid the former owner, one reason being that the 250-acre plot he will be able keep for himself has yet to be designated. The Government has promised to pay owners for the confiscated land in Government bonds of up to 30 years. Guardsmen Are Replaced **********Leaders at many cooperatives were assassinated last year, allegedly by members of the security forces loyal to the former landlords. Los Lagartos did not have that problem. Nonetheless, the two National Guardsmen who were stationed here for many years have been transferred and six new ones brought in. The two, according to one of the new guardsmen, received a salary from the former owner in addition to their Guard salary. **********Most major decisions at the cooperative are made by a general assembly of the members. Administrators and the heads of work committees are elected, and are mostly peasants who can read and write. That narrows the field considerably since only about one-third of the rural population is literate. **********Complaints that early administrators were inefficient and were giving their friends easy jobs led to some being replaced, though there are still complaints. **********Officials from the Government's Institute for Agrarian Transformation are working closely with the cooperatives in a threeyear transition program. The institute also provides agrarian experts as well as training. The ''Great House'' is used for classes.  Insecticides Needed Urgently **********But what peasants say they need most are legal and financial experts. A shortage of financing because of the deficit in the country's balance of payments is slowing fertilizing and feeding.  There is barely enough work for some cooperative members. **********Perhaps worse, coffee rust, a plant disease, is spreading and could destroy crops if enough insecticides are not bought and sprayed soon.  The Reagan Administration is considering providing credit for such imports as part of an emergency economic aid package. In the meantime, the Government, which has already received $57 million in direct and indirect aid for the agrarian program, is scraping to find more funds. **********About 30 of the country's cooperatives have been cut off at one time or another by Marxist guerrillas. Los Lagartos is not in a guerrilla-infested area, and at the moment it does not appear they would be well received. Many of the peasants said they resent the guerrilla tactics of cutting roads, blowing up power lines and burning buses, trains and warehouses. **********''They are destroying our occupations,'' said Mr. Oriana."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/02/business/gerber-products-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GERBER PRODUCTS CO reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "GERBER PRODUCTS CO reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/15/business/heritage-bancorporation-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HERITAGE BANCORPORATION reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "HERITAGE BANCORPORATION reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/13/business/briefs-155316.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 306, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Motors Corp. said it will resume operations at a stamping plant in Milwaukee on Aug. 17, for the first time since September. * Bentley Laboratories Inc. said it was seeking a buyer. *********** Cray Research Inc. said it would install a $4.5 million Cray-One-B computer system at the University of Minnesota computer center. *********** GEO International Corp. is expanding its drilling fluids activity into the Southeastern market with the acquisition of Mississippi Mud Inc. of Laurel, Miss., for an undisclosed sum. *********** MSI Data Corp. entered into a letter of authorization with the International Business Machines Corporation for preliminary development work that could lead to an order in the future for a portable data terminal to be used internationally by the I.B.M.  customer service division. *********** Liberty National Insurance Holding Co. said it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Continental Investment Corp., now in reorganization, for $159 million.

In the next few years, the costs can be expected to reach $2 billion to $3 billion annually. **********What is known as the ''dialysis population'' in this country is now about 62,000, compared with about 16,000 five years ago. It rose last year by about 7,000 people, despite the fact that 2,000 had kidney transplants, which took them off dialysis for as much as five years. But only about half of kidney transplants are successful. **********Medical authorities say the dialysis population could rise to at least 90,000 by the end of the 1980's, with costs reaching $4 billion to $5 billion annually. **********The main treatment for kidney failure, or drastic impairment of the organ that is vital for cleansing the blood of waste, is hemodialysis, or an artificial kidney machine. Beyond that, a kidney transplant, though not feasible in all cases, may bring at least a temporary cure. **********For the patient, there is now almost complete protection on the major costs of such treatment. In 1973, the Social Security Act was amended to extend Medicare benefits for the first time to persons under 65, specifically to anyone suffering kidney failure. Medicare now pays 80 percent of the costs of hospitalization and treatment, and 100 percent of kidney transplant costs. **********Dr. Jeffrey Brensilver, attending nephrologist at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan, and an assistant professor at Columbia University, said a national program of benefits is necessary because kidney diseases are prevalent everywhere - in small and large communities. He noted that ghetto populations, which he said are more prone to high blood pressure and stress that cause many kidney diseases, need particular help on costs. **********New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and most other states take care of the additional 20 percent of treatment costs. In addition, Blue Cross and other private health insurance provide some benefits - perhaps three or four months of outpatient treatment. **********But, with rising costs of the benefits program, attributed mainly to the greater number of kidney-disease patients who survive because of the increasingly advanced technology available to them, anxiety is growing over the possibility that a budget-conscious Reagan Administration might reduce benefits. If, doctors assert, the present program is cut back - there has been no proposal, but the worry persists - it will imply that those who can't handle the costs simply won't survive. **********''We have to consider that we have nearly 60,000 people walking around who wouldn't be here if it were not for the program,'' said Dr. Belding H. Scribner, professor of medicine and head of the division of nephrology at the University of Washington. The program under Medicare has been regarded as a model for similar programs involving high-cost medical technology, Dr. Scribner said, and future development of heart transplants and artificial hearts will also raise problems of financing. **********Added Dr. Michael Michelis, chief of the kidney hypertension unit at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan: ''I find it encouraging that one-third of our unit's 50 patients have been returned to full-time jobs. This is a program that works.'' **********In dialysis - from the Greek for ''dissolve'' - the patient's blood is circulated through a machine containing artificial membranes and solutions that cleanse the blood of impurities before it is returned to the patient's body. **********Treatment, usually taking four hours, two or three times a week, costs about $130 to $150 at hospitals, clinics or special dialysis centers. Average annual cost per patient: $25,000 a year, plus in some cases treatment for complications that can involve the lungs, heart, or other organs. **********Home treatment, with the aid of a spouse or relative, or with a visiting nurse or paramedic, is less - perhaps $18,000 a year with a dialysis machine costing $5,000 or more. **********The kidney-disease patient's primary guide to help is the physician. But there are other groups offering assistance such as the National Kidney Foundation in Manhattan and the National Association of Patients on Hemodialysis and Transplantation, based in Great Neck, L.I. **********Margaret F. Diener, executive director of the patient group for the foundation, said there are now about 1,000 dialysis units in this country, mostly in major cities, and there are units also in about 50 foreign countries, primarily in Western Europe. **********There are now two main paths open for holding down dialysis costs for individuals: the encouragement of more home treatment through educational and special training programs and the development of simpler and more effective dialysis equipment. **********Dr. Michelis of Lenox Hill noted that while the effectiveness of treatment is improving steadily, costs, other than those for labor and materials, have not risen substantially. With an increase of home care, now accounting for about 10 percent of patients, he said, individual costs could be cut. **********Concerning progress in reducing the costs of dialysis machines, particularly with smaller ''suitcase'' models, Dr. Robert Stephen of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, said a number of prototypes had been developed but that commercial production is still years away and in their current state of development, the new models would cost three times what a current one costs. **********Dr. Stephen, associate director of the division of artificial organs at the university, is a close associate of Dr. Willem Kolff, who in 1945 perfected the first successful artificial kidney. **********Technically, Dr. Stephen said, it is now possible to produce the portable, more efficient machine if costs could be brought down. The machines ''would then be less expensive and less complicated,'' Dr.  Stephen observed, ''and would also allow patients to go on one- or two-hour daily sessions that we feel would be better for them than the present four-hour treatments.'' He estimated per-treatment costs at $50."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/20/business/atlantic-oil-corp-denver-colo-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ATLANTIC OIL CORP (DENVER, COLO) reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "print_headline": "ATLANTIC OIL CORP (DENVER, COLO) reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/01/world/amid-the-anarchy-of-beirut-8-die-in-shelling-on-a-beach.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1981-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 996, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMID THE ANARCHY OF BEIRUT, 8 DIE IN SHELLING ON A BEACH", "print_headline": "AMID THE ANARCHY OF BEIRUT, 8 DIE IN SHELLING ON A BEACH", "body_text": " **********The beaches were jammed this afternoon, as they always are here on Sunday, when the Lebanese try to enjoy the sun and the Mediterranean, two of the few gifts they have left. **********Then the rockets hit. Within seconds, the beach front in West Beirut emptied in pandemonium, people fleeing into the streets in their bathing suits. Cars careered the wrong way on one-way streets, horns blaring. Gunfire crackled as the gunmen of half a dozen factions fired pistols and Kalashnikov rifles in the air. **********In the emergency room of the American University hospital, where the casualties from the beach were taken, a doctor said this evening that 8 people had died and that about 60 were wounded. Chronic Chaos in Beirut **********It was perhaps the worst incident in a violent weekend here as constant shelling echoed across the so-called Green Line, which divides Beirut into a Christian east and a predominantly Moslem west. **********In the chronic chaos here, statistics are uncertain, but officials said that about 15 people were killed overnight and 18 during the day, and that more than 100 were wounded. **********As usual, nobody could say for sure who started the shelling, and each side blamed the other. But, in a way, it simply does not matter anymore. Victims of Anarchic War **********Beirut is settling into a permanent state of anarchic war. The victims are not the defenders of various causes in their tailored fatigue uniforms, who are hunkered down in heavily sandbagged shelters, but the old woman buying eggs, the auto repairman, the young couple on the beach and the children growing up with nothing else. **********In the Moslem districts along Corniche Mazraa, few people have been able to sleep for the last two nights because of the artillery fire.  Across town, the Christian neighborhood of Achrafayieh is nearly deserted, with its residents having fled into the mountains and its clean streets, lined with French colonial architecture, eerily silent. Shells in Yacht Club Harbor **********Up the coast, near the Maronite Catholic port of Junieh, where a huge statue of Jesus dominates a hilltop, several shells crashed into the harbor of the Kaslik Yacht Club among the bobbing white powerboats. One man was injured. **********The fighting comes in fits and starts. It has stepped up in the last few days, since the departure from the Middle East of President Reagan's special envoy, Philip C. Habib, who is seeking a way out of the standoff between Israel and Syria over the SAM-6 antiaircraft missiles Syria has stationed in the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon. **********''It won't last long,'' a doctor at the American University hospital said last night, referring to the intensified violence, ''because Habib will be coming back soon.'' **********But Mr. Habib's mission is only the latest round in a continuous crisis here. The crisis is rooted in a centuries-old feud that tore this country into warring factions half a dozen years ago. **********After the overnight artillery fire the morning was clear and quiet. Diners enjoying a late lunch of Lebanese mezza at the lamb house overlooking the Mediterranean suddenly saw two shells crash into the sea. **********Across the street, under a Ferris wheel, the clientele of the open-air Mediterranean restaurant vanished, leaving upturned chairs and half-eaten broiled fish. Beach Road Is Unusual Target **********The Corniche, the beach road running along Ras Beirut, or Beirut Neck, is one of the few pleasures left to the average people in West Beirut. Each Sunday it is crowded with cars and picnickers perched over the traffic islands, and its broad sidewalk is choked with strollers and vendors selling fruit drinks, shoes, pitchers, glassware and plastic toy monsters. **********The area is normally not fired upon.  But about 4 this afternoon, wounded people said, five rockets slammed into Long Beach, a broad strip of sand lying just down the hill from a Syrian roadblock and antiaircraft positions. **********Although much of the shoreline is cut up by private beach clubs, this is a ''free beach,'' where there is no required membership or admission. The sand was covered with people, many of whom had been cooped up in hallway or basement shelters for the last two days. **********Barefoot people ran screaming up the road. The taxicabs disappeared, and people tried to grab the few private cars on the road. Families near their autos piled in and raced off. Business District Is Deserted **********At least one shell fell near the Hamra business district, sending people scurrying. Leftist militiamen piled into their trucks and cars and drove wildly, firing into the air. **********In the ramshackle row of corrugated iron stalls along the Corniche that form a makeshift bazaar, the steel gates clanged down. Within minutes the area was deserted, with Palestinian commandos setting up roadblocks and ambulances wailing toward the beach. **********Firing stepped up along the Green Line as darkness fell. From the Muir Tower, a half-finished skyscraper towering over the vegetable market, Syrian troops fired at the Christian part of town. **********The Christian artillery had been sounding most of the day, too.  Shortly after dark gunmen from one of west Beirut's leftist factions brandished their Kalashnikov rifles in a Mobil service station in Ras Beirut and made off with two ambulances parked there. A Packed Emergency Room **********At the American University hospital the wounded from the beach were brought in on stretchers. Several leftist militiamen in uniform were also carried in, their ammunition belts stripped off and given to their friends before they underwent treatment. **********At least 30 people were brought in within half an hour, and three ambulances were backed up by the emergency room door, but the staff seemed calm. **********''We're used to this sort of thing,'' a nurse said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/26/business/business-people-energy-aide-at-coopers.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1981-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 261, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ENERGY AIDE AT COOPERS", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; ENERGY AIDE AT COOPERS", "body_text": " **********W.

The sound: the tinkling of silver and china, the hum of conversation. The food: excellent, royal squab grille, croustade of chicken livers or broiled fresh mushrooms on toast. A bottle of wine perhaps. Then the coffee, and the cup refilled without request. **********The check is laid upon the table in a most discreet fashion, and the payment, usually by credit card, sometimes by cash, follows.  Finally, the most important part of all - the light blue customer's copy from the American Express receipt is placed in pocket, purse or billfold. For the ultimate purchaser of the meal is not the businessman or businesswoman who signed for the meal, but the host's employer and ultimately, in large part, the American taxpayer. **********The meal is a product of that important American institution, the expense account.  Each year, individuals and corporations deduct billions of dollars from their revenues for meals, drinks, hotel rooms, entertainment and travel, thus reducing their taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department say it's impossible to calculate the amount of money involved, but Sidney Rutberg, author of ''The Joy of Expense Account Living,'' put the fig-ure at $54 billion annually. A sizable but much smaller estimate by a Library of Congress study put deductible spending for meals alone at $3.2 billion in 1976. **********It is one pocket of the economy that is unlikely to be touched by the Reagan Administration's budget writers. ''That's not the way the wind is blowing,'' said a Treasury Department official. **********The expense account is a businessman's perquisite that the businessman is rarely forced to defend. That's because one man's perk is another man's profit. Major businesses - restaurants, hotels, banking and credit card companies, theaters, professional sports, convention operators, airlines, car rental agencies and limousine services - often depend for a lion's share of their business on the expense account. **********Yet critics of the expense account say that it is responsible for higher prices in restaurants, hotels and airline travel, and that it often means that business decisions are not made on the basis of the quality of a product, but on the basis of personal or social obligations established by the expense account. They also say that the expense account system can lead to corruption. **********Philip M. Stern, author of ''The Great American Treasury Raid'' and ''The Rape of the Taxpayer,'' both studies of American tax policies, said, ''The expense account creates a two-class society, those who can utilize expense accounts, generally the middle and upper classes, and those who cannot, the working class and the poor.'' **********The Treasury Department, which in 1978 told of a taxpayer who had legitimatly deducted every meal for two years with the exception of one day, said that, with inflation, making extensive entertainment and travel privileges available to executives instead of salary was an attractive prospect for both employers and employees. Moreover, it appears that people with access to expense accounts will increasingly resort to them, sometimes in illegal ways, to increase income, Treasury officers believe. **********According to the New York State Restaurant Association, about 25 percent of the meals bought in all of New York City are expense account meals, and those in the restaurant industy say the figure rises to perhaps 50 percent in such business districts of Manhattan, Boston, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. **********New York food authorities believe, however, that in the restaurants widely regarded as the city's finest - 21 Club, the Four Seasons, the Palm, Lutece, La Grenouille and Christ Cella - perhaps 70 to 90 percent of lunches and dinners are placed on expense accounts. **********''Midtown is credit cards, and a large percentage of credit cards are business lunches,'' said Thomas Haas, publisher of Nation's Restaurant News. **********These restaurants are places where patrons can easily pay $50 to $100 for two for lunch and perhaps $135 to $160 for dinner. Some call the expense account lunch - or dinner, or, increasingly, breakfast - the Government's largest food program. **********Last year, 17.1 million visitors came to New York City, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, with a vast number on business trips, although the exact number is not known. The American Hotel and Motel Association says about 65 percent of the nation's hotel and motel guests - an estimated 1.4 million hotel and motel rooms are occupied every night with yearly lodging costs estimated at $25.9 billion - are businessmen, government employees or convention goers, people who could legitimately claim deductions on their room rates. In New York, such hotels as the Waldorf-Astoria, the Pierre, the Grand Hyatt and the Hilton are favorite dwellings for visiting businessmen. **********The American Express Company, the nation's leading travel and entertainment card company, with 11.9 million subscribers, says a majority of the use of its cards is for business expenses. The Air Transport Association says that one-half of the 300 million passengers that its member airlines carried last year - they paid $30 billion in fares - were on business trips. **********Other expense account conveniences involve the use of an employer's credit card to get discounts on rental cars or hotel rates. In professional baseball and football, large blocks of tickets are often bought by companies and other institutions. The tickets are made available to clients or employees, and the costs deducted from the company's revenues. **********Trips that combine business and entertainment - to the Greenbriar, the conference and resort center in West Virginia, the Masters golf tournament, the Superbowl, to business conferences in Mexico, the Caribbean or Europe -are often considered legitimate business deductions, meaning that the costs of attending the business meetings as well as food and drink and often lavish entertainment are borne at least in part by the nation's taxpayers. **********People in businesses that benefit from its use vigorously defend the expense account. ''The business meal often offers the only means that some elements of the business community have to approach a customer,'' said Robert B. Neville, chief counsel of the National Restaurant Association. A lunch or drink, or a pleasant resort, contribute to an atmosphere of congenialty and trust among businessmen, defenders says. And Mr. Neville suggests that they also often increase productivity. **********''I find business lunches extremely beneficial,'' says James Kennedy, a tax partner with Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., one of the nation's major accounting firms. He says if he has a meal by himself, his company gains nothing, but that if he takes someone to lunch and discusses business, his company benefits. **********''It's not the luxury of the food or the luxury of the drinks,'' according to Mr. Kennedy, who says he also takes clients to dinner and to such events as New York Knickerbocker games. ''It's the luxury of the surroundings. To be uninterrupted for an hour - that can be luxurious, too.'' He adds he does not entertain clients because the expenses are deductable. If his company does not gain, he does not entertain. **********''There's hardly a reason to have a meal in a restaurant that does not involve business,'' said Eric Green, of the restaurant consulting firm of Harris, Kerr, Forster & Company. **********Yet Ralph Nader, the frequent business critic, says, ''Inflationary forces are held in check when people who pay the bills, pay all the bills.'' He suggests that when the prices of the finest steak and wine are subsizied (business resents the word) by expense account purchases, price increases filter down to the lowliest hamburger and soda. Mr. Nader calls the expense account a kind of transfer payment, a term economists use to describe programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, or unemployment compensation. **********Tax deductions for business travel and entertainment last came under attack when President Carter complained during the 1976 Presidential campaign that it was unfair for a businessman to deduct a restaurant meal from his taxes, when a hod-carrier cannot deduct a bologna sandwich. As President, he proposed that the price of a business meal and drinks - the so-called ''three-martini lunch'' - be cut to 50 percent. He also would have eliminated deductions for other business entertainment, club dues, tickets to theater and symphony performances and sporting events, yachts and hunting lodges. In addition, he would have disallowed first-class air travel deductions by the amount they exceeded coach travel. **********But the Carter proposals were easily defeated. Al Ullman, former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, ''We're not going to pass a bill that puts half of America out of business.'' **********It is the jobs argument - that entertainment and travel deductions would mean reductions in employment - that is most often advanced by business and labor to defend the deductions. **********Fred Sampson, executive director of the New York State Restaurant Association, says that if a proposal like that advanced by the Carter Administration were passed, it would mean a 25 percent reduction in jobs in the New York restaurant industry, which employs 150,000 workers. Those affected, he said, would be women, blacks, Hispanic workers and the disabled, all employed in the restaurant industry. **********He adds, ''Lots of people who work in our industry - and thank God we have them, don't misunderstand me - if they were not working for us and supporting government services with their tax dollars, they would be on the dole.'' **********Robert Juliano, chief lobbyist with the 450,000-member Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union, says he is not troubled making the jobs argument, although it opens him to charges that he is a collaborationist. ''For us, it's one issue, and one issue alone,'' he said. ''Jobs. Jobs. And jobs.'' **********Mr. Nader, however, strongly opposes the expense account because, he said, it is an example of ''nonmeritorious competition.'' He says: ''You get your sale from your customer not by providing better quality, durability, a warranty, or safety, but by wining and dining.'' **********He adds that the expense account can lead to corruption. ''When people wine and dine politicians, they get them a little tipsy. They take them to the Yucatan or them take them on a hunting trip. They get them drunk and they have a nice, happy time, and then they've got them. Six months later when this sobered-up senator meets with some lobbyist, in the back of his mind is, 'They know something about me I don't want anybody else to know,' '' Mr. Nader says. **********Virtually the entire defense of deductions in Congressional hearings was given by officials of the restaurant or hotel industries, or from labor institutions that benefit from the expense account system, not by businessmen or others with the availability of expense accounts, notes Thomas F. Field, executive director of Taxation With Representation, a tax group. He rejects the argument that the expense account provides employment, and says the real reason food, lodging and travel industries oppose expense account curtailment is that it would reduce profits. **********Daniel Halprin, a Georgetown University law professor, who as a Treasury Department lawyer was charged with helping institute the Carter Administration proposals, says of the meal, drinks, and other entertainment expenses: ''If they are the thing that makes business go, if they are essential to doing business, there is no reason to expect that they wouldn't continue'' even if deductions were disallowed. But he adds, ''If they really aren't efficient, if people are being driven to do this only because of the tax benefits involved, certainly they are not something you would want to continue.'' **********He says the Carter Administration's proposals were defeated for three reasons. First, they became, under the phrase ''the threemartini lunch,'' humorous, even though vast amounts of money were involved. Second, many Government officials and politicans in Washington enjoy the amenities of the expense acount, making it difficult to alter the system. Finally, he says, the combined opposition of industry and labor was difficult to counter. **********And Sheldon Tallen, an owner of the 21 Club in Manhattan, suggests there was no reason for the law to change in the current political climate. ''Business and restaurants and people who work in restaurants cannot do without each other,'' he says."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/26/business/international-dairy-queen-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL DAIRY QUEEN INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL DAIRY QUEEN INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/23/world/around-the-world-gunmen-in-west-beirut-fire-at-the-us-embassy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gunmen in West Beirut Fire at the U.S. Embassy", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Gunmen in West Beirut Fire at the U.S. Embassy", "body_text": " **********Unidentified gunmen in a speeding car fired automatic weapons at the American Embassy in the western sector of Beirut early today and Lebanese guards returned fire, an embassy spokesman said.

Haig Jr. in which he discussed t he Middle East: **********Q. Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel will be visiting next week. What kind of a role do you see for the United States over the next several months in negotiations between Israel and Egypt? **********A. Let's answer the question by talking about the visit itself and how the visit will or will not contribute to that. Clearly, we had discussions during the Sadat visit on the Middle East peace process, and it was clear then that President Sadat is anxious to get on with both phases of the Camp David structure. We've had in the meantime an announced meeting to go on with that process on Sept. 23 at the ministerial level - that's the autonomy talks. **********So with respect to Mr. Begin's visit, we are very anxious to hear how he views this process, particularly with respect to the autonomy talks. **********But I think it's important that we view the prospects for the peace process itself under the Camp David framework; that we recognize there have been some fundamental changes since Camp David in the whole Middle East environment and situation. **********One of those changes is now an interrelationship which has developed between the situation in Lebanon and the peace process which, while on totally separate tracks, are increasingly interrelated, and a failure or a collapse of one can have a serious impact on the other; whereas progress in one contributes to an atmosphere of progress in the other. A Strategic Consensus **********Q. When you said that things have changed since Camp David, do you mean to say that you're looking for some widening of the framework of these negotiations? **********A. No. What I'm saying is that the environment has changed. When I went to the Middle East in April-May, you will recall my talking about a strategic consensus. Whether that's the right terminology for the phenomenon is less important than the fact that there is such a consensus. **********I wasn't talking about creating one. I kept hitting that as we went around. I was talking about the fact that one was emerging historically, and it was a product of post-Camp David events. **********What am I speaking of? I'm speaking of the collapse of the Shah of Iran, of the Iran-Iraq conflict, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the dynamics of the Horn of Africa and the two Yemens - that all of these things were a fact of life that have impinged upon the perceptions of the nations in the area with respect to the Soviet threat. **********It was really this strategic consensus - and still in embryo but nonetheless existent - which moved in under the Habib mission, the first to deal with the initial crisis itself in Lebanon, and you recall that was restricted. Surviving 2 Jolts **********Q. The Syrian missiles?A. Missiles, Zahle town, the Heights overlooking the Christian heartland and the efforts that Phil Habib launched at the President's direction to try to resolve that issue. **********That involved harnessing leadership and support from the Arab League, and with considerable help from Saudi Arabia not only in leadership and diplomacy but in resources which catalyzed certain progress. **********That progress was not certain. There was evidence of it, but it wasn't complete, when the whole process was jolted severely, first by the Israeli raid on the Iraqi reactor; and, secondly, the subsequent increased violence along the border of Israel, which involved Palestinians, the P.L.O. and the Israeli forces. **********The simp le fact of that, as a value judgment, is that this consensus had to be a very strong element in the new Middle Eastern mix or that p rocess would have collapsed by either of those two shocks. It ma naged to sustain itself in a very shaky way by some veryskillful work by Phil to produce a cessation of hostilities. **********That's not an insignificant new factor in the whole Middle East process, and it must never be overlooked as we talk about the strategic consensus, because that's what we're talking about. Uncertainty Over Meeting **********Q. The Egyptians and Israelis have talked about this ministerial level meeting on the 23d. Obviously, they mean real ministers. You can't attend. You've got business elsewhere on the 23d. **********A. There's still some uncertainty about this meeting in terms of location. We will participate, in any event, at whatever appropriate level we decide upon, and that should not be done until we have a little more information from both parties. Q. Is it possible you might move to New Yor k?  A. It's not impossible, and we would be hap py to do that. Or it's also possible that we would have one meeting at that time in which we would be represented on another level and have it take place in Egypt or any place else, and that it would be followed by another meeting that I could perhaps participate in.  We have some judgments to make before we get definitive on it, and c ertainly the discussionswith Mr. Begin will help in that regard. **********Q. I take it from what you're saying that it is your inclination not to have a special superambassador on this as has been done in the past? **********A. No. It is my inclination that it's too early to know whether or not such an ambassador would make an important contribution, or whether it's better to approach it from another point of view, either high or low level, so we have not prejudged it. **********Q. It's been done both ways, obviously. Kissinger and Vance did it; then they switched.  A. One of the outcomes of the Begin visit we hope for is a sharpening of our thinking on that subject. So while I'm getting back to the Begin visit, there will be two aspects of it. **********We would want to discuss the peace process under the Camp David framework and specifically the autonomy talks. Our strong feeling, which is now clearly shared by the other two partners - and we want to be a partner in this effort - is to get on with it and to get on with it rapidly. Regional Security **********Q. You said the first part of the talks with Begin will be on the autonomy.  A. Yes. And the second part, clearly, will be on the Lebanon process, which is far more fragile, far more prone to disruption and mischief making, and far more complex because of multiplicity of interest in parties involved -internal parties in Lebanon, Syria, with whatever degree of mischief the Soviets might or might not care to apply, and the other Arab states that have been involved. **********Q. Will Mr. Habib be here for those talks?  A. Yes. We want Phil here for precisely that reason, and it's clear that his rule of concern is that thus far that this cessation of hostilities not be an umbrella under which the P.L.O. can be further rearmed and strengthened and the Syrian missiles remain untended. **********So it is fragile and they must be reassured, and we must get progress and we must get cooperation from all the parties to get it, and Israel's cooperation is required as well. **********The third thing that this visit will involve, and probably first and foremost the most important thing is a meeting engagement between two leaders who have never met. I suppose I've become increasingly sensitive to the importance of the chemistry of the meeting of leaders. **********Let me add another final point for the Begin meeting that will also be on the agenda, and that's a discussion of the bilateral relationships in the sense of the period ahead in a changing situation - strategic concerns - and whether or not we are going to reaffirm. There's been a lot of rhetoric in the past and I think both sides are interested in putting some meat on the bone for that rhetoric with respect to our bilateral strategic relationship. **********Q. ''Putting some meat on the bone for the rhetoric.'' There's always the constant talk about some kind of defense, mutual security agreement. You're not talking about --A. No. I'm not talking about a treaty or an agreement, but I'm talking about practical cooperation, practical cooperation that will contribute to regional security. **********Q. Will you give me any hint on that? What you mean?  A. That could involve any number of things.  Awacs Discussion **********Q. Where will the Awacs discussion come in on this?  A. The Awacs discussion, I think, will come on probably early in the meeting and be disposed of rapidly. We understand, and I think the President will understand, Israel's natural concerns about any enhancement of Arab capabilities, especially in a neighboring Arab state. **********There's nobody that I think would approach this meeting with a view toward making this a litmus test of future relationships. It cannot be. We are very confident that the position we have taken on Awacs is the correct one. It is in America's strategic interest. It coincides with our regional objectives, and therefore indirectly - although difficult for Israel to accept -we feel it meets their interests as well. **********Q. How would you, just in a nutshell, explain to an Israeli supporter - you will get a chance at this many times in the next few weeks - how it serves Israel's interests? **********A. First and foremost, it brings America' s presence - we've talked about two Israels for some time. Some people have said, ''You are a strategic asset.'' That bothers Israelis. And why does it bother them? Because they've been the bastion, and a rather lonely bastion historically, toward Soviet inroads in the Mi ddle East. **********Historically, the United States has been somewhat less than that, and so in that context this Awacs, the American presence with respect to it - even though being in a sovereign nation -should be operated and owned with sovereignty in mind. It couldn't expect to be otherwise. **********It is a manifestation of, among a number of other steps that we are considering with the R.D.F. (Rapid Deployment Force) and not bases but facilities. That's a very important argument. **********Another very important argument is that it is in Israel's interest for someone else to provide Saudi Arabia with assistance, and we don't think so. **********Thirdly, we think that the operation of the system itself for the foreseeable future, our support will be inherent -maintenance and operation and supply of the system for the life of the system. All of these things, plus operating conditions, which will be explained when the consultation process starts in Congress, are justified that this is the right decision. **********We understand Israel has concerns about it as it is entitled to and which they have a right to express. I think on the American side we have to confine our approach to convincing the Senate that it should not challenge this important initiative taken by the President which could damage his foreign policy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/20/business/american-agronomics-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN AGRONOMICS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "print_headline": "AMERICAN AGRONOMICS CORP reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/24/business/business-digest-saturday-october-24-1981-the-economy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 667, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1981; The Economy", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST; SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1981; The Economy", "body_text": " **********The Consumer Price Index rose 1.2 percent in September.

''Evidence for an act of accusation does not have to contain a word of truth. Words are the evidence -no matter what words.'' **********The unsigned pamphlet was produced by an underground publishing house and was evidently compiled by people who had frequent dealings with the secret police. It first appeared in September, amid the rush of hopes for political liberalization brought about by the Gdansk strikes in August. It has already gone through three printings.

But it also outlines sections of the Criminal Code stipulating certain rights accorded suspects and witnesses. Most are unaware of these rights and the police are hardly disposed to inform them. Answering Questions Not Required **********It is possible to cite Article 166, which permits witnesses not to answer questions. The pamphlet says: ''The witness does not have to explain his refusal. It is extremely important to refuse answers because one who is a witness today can be the accused tomorrow and his answers can be used against him. If you are not strong enough to refuse, you can say 'I do not remember.' But this is not a good solution because it gives an opportunity for conversation, which should not be done under any circumstances.'' **********Under Polish law, the book says, persons who are detained are entitled to know the reason. They should demand to know the reason, the pamphlet says, even though they will probably not be told.  ''Sometimes we are told it is because we look like a dangerous criminal,'' it goes on. ''The militia man simply says he was 'told to' or answers 'Do not be so curious or I'll smash your face in.' '' **********The pamphlet paints a dark picture of the operations of the security police, asserting that they try to obtain information through illegal means, including lies, blackmail, threats, slander, force and imprisonment. It counsels a firm refusal to cooperate because any sign of wavering will be seized upon. **********''They are on the lookout for weak people,'' the readers are warned. ''If during the first talk, we do not give a strong 'no,' they begin the telephone calls, the visits at home and at work and the offer of meetings. **********''After a while, we are tired of it and surrender and 'for the sake of peace' agree to sign some sort of a paper, which most often is a promise to remain silent about these talks. Such a document can be easily changed, by cutting out a few words and and piecing them together, and used as blackmail.'' **********The readers are left with a final cautioning message: ''When we are under interrogation we should remember that one day we will be set free and will have to look our friends in the eye.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/24/world/afghan-war-economy-thin-diets-fast-fortune.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1042, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AFGHAN WAR ECONOMY: THIN DIETS, FAST FORTUNE", "print_headline": "AFGHAN WAR ECONOMY: THIN DIETS, FAST FORTUNE", "body_text": " **********Considering that a guerrilla war has been raging in Afghanistan for more than three years, the rural economy of the largely isolated desert and mountain settlements has survived with remarkable self-sufficiency. **********During six weeks of traveling in the countryside, most of it far from major roads or towns, this reporter found people living in stark conditions, but there were no signs of hunger or widescale malnutrition. **********Certainly for most of the hardy and poor people of Afghanistan the war has meant a steady, meager diet of bread and tea, often without sugar. For some, willing and eager to run the new risks of conflict, the war has brought relative riches, mostly from an active trade in guns and hashish. **********Many guerrillas talked openly of their bizarre black market collusion with the Soviet and Afghan troops who are their battlefield adversaries. Corrupt quartermasters are reportedly supplying diesel fuel and ammunition to the guerrillas in exchange for cash or hashish. A Boom in Lumbering **********In Paktia Province, a mountainous area, the war has led to a boom in lumbering. Most of the country's mountain slopes have been stripped of cover by generations who relied on wood for cooking and heating, but Paktia still has forests of cedar. Before the war the Government protected these woods but now the foresters are gone and there is no real administration. As a result the local tribes are felling trees with abandon. **********Along the three foot wide tracks that lace through the mountains, trains of camels plod, with each animal carrying two 400-pound logs.  The price paid for each log just over the border in Pakistan is $200, which is a great deal of money in Afghanistan, where the per capita annual income is about $190. **********As in peacetime, much of the economic activity in the rural areas involves subsistence farming. Men often divide their time between their homes and guerrilla groups, while women and young children tend fields and flocks. **********Some guerrillas explained that families were sometimes divided, with one brother taking some of the women to sanctuary in Pakistan, while others either stayed behind or joined the insurgents. There seemed to be some rotation among the men, who at times rested in Pakistan from the battle. Some Rebels Receive Pay **********Within some of the guerrilla groups food, such as it was, and the spoils of battle were distributed in equal shares. Some of the fighters are reported to receive regular pay, but others have only the barest essentials. One group had been forced to sell a rifle to buy food, and a few weeks later, when the unit's commander ordered a chicken killed in honor of the unexpected visit of a journalist, the 15 men who shared the meal said it was the first time they had tasted meat in two weeks. **********In addition to the food and clothes produced for purely local consumption, there is wider trade and commerce, as in the case of the logging in Paktia. In Kandahar, grapes are harvested and dried into raisins and funnelled into urban markets. Fruit and mutton as well as firewood does make its way to Kabul, the capital. **********In the small village shops, there is produce that has obviously come from the cities; drinking glasses from France, ballpoint pens, Russian cigarettes, cookies, rubber slippers and razor blades. Each of the tiny shops, which also sell dates, eggs and watermelon, had the same stock. The unit of exchange everywhere was the afghani, the country's unit of currency. No one would accept dollars, though Pakistani rupees were willingly taken. **********In addition to the sharing and self-sacrifice of the rebels, there is some evidence that guerrilla groups behave like brigands and demand tribute from civilians. Some Reports of Extortion **********There are reports of extortion and some of the guerrillas visited suggested that this might be the work of Government-sponsored provocateurs seeking to discredit the resistance fighters. Other rebels, though, said they had heard of young, undisciplined tribesmen who may have demanded not only food and shelter but actual taxes from villagers. **********Another recent problem described by the guerrillas involved urban merchants who, presumably out of sympathy, supplied food and equipment to the guerrillas at night. The fighters said that some merchants had been telling them that in some cases local Communist officials were keeping close watch on their stocks, demanding day by day accountings. **********Another aspect of the war economy involves the refugees in Pakistan and the amount of support provided to them by international agencies and Islamic groups. Officially, Pakistan and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees put the number of those who have sought sanctuary at close to 2.5 million, but some of the aid officials privately doubt this number. **********Some of these people say that many of the refugees register more members of their family than have actually come to Pakistan, and draw benefits fraudulently. The refugees receive $5 a month per person, with a maximum of $50 per family each month. Abuses Hard to Gauge **********Some people are said to collect this amount while actually spending most of their time in Afghanistan working their farms and coming across regularly to collect their benefits. It is hard to determine how widespread such abuses are and there is no doubt that most of the refugees are in genuine difficulties, living in tents.

Allen, President Reagan's national security adviser, has played a role behind the scenes in trade negotiations between the United States and Japan for more than a decade, according to Japanese Government officials. **********''Takase has occasionally served as a kind of go-between and informal line of communication between Japan and America,'' said a high official in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry who asked not to be identified. **********Mr. Takase's wife, Chizuko, was one of three Japanese women involved in a $1,000 payment received by Mr. Allen after a Japanese magazine interview with Nancy Reagan on Jan. 21 that the White House adviser helped arrange. **********Just what Mr. Takase's role in negotiations has been in specific instances remains unclear. He has sometimes merely been present at meetings between Americans and Japanese, usually meetings that occur outside official negotiating channels. At other times he has apparently served as a messenger. **********Meeting With Toyota Head **********Mr. Allen met in March with Shoichiro Toyoda, head of the Toyota Motor Sales Company, at a time when the Reagan Administration was debating lower import quotas for Japanese cars. Mr. Takase attended that session. **********During last year's Presidential campaign, Mr. Allen was accused of having leaked trade secrets to Mr. Takase while Mr. Allen worked in the Nixon White House. The charges resulted in Mr. Allen's resignation as a Reagan campaign adviser. After Mr. Reagan's victory, Mr. Allen was reinstated as foreign policy adviser after Mr. Reagan said there was no evidence that Mr. Allen had done anything wrong. **********On at least one occasion, Mr. Takase is said to have been a more active figure in negotiations between Tokyo and Washington. In his book ''The White House Years,'' former Secretary of State Henry A.  Kissinger describes his contacts with an unidentified emissary from Japan, who was not a Government official, during negotiations that began in 1969 on reducing Japanese textile exports. **********''It is widely believed that Takase is that man,'' said another official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry official who also asked that his name not be used. Japanese diplomats confirmed that Mr. Takase was the ''back channel'' used by Prime Minister Eisaku Sato to try to resolve the textile issue at frequent meetings with Mr. Kissinger. Tradition of Go-Betweens **********In Japan, there is a long tradition of men such as Mr. Takase, who are sometimes called kuroko, or ''stagehands,'' a term taken from the Kabuki theater. Such people act as intermediaries so that political leaders and their aides do not become personally involved in difficult negotiations. **********The reason for this is that through the use of go-betweens, the leaders may be able to avoid loss of face if negotiations go badly, a paramount consideration in a formal society. **********Mr. Takase, 52 years old, is a professor at Kyoto Industrial University. But his university position is largely a vehicle for a career in business, Japanese diplomats said; it gives Mr. Takase prestige and an impressive calling card. Diplomats said his salary at the university would be insufficient to cover frequent visits to the United States. **********Mr. Takase is ''not a scholar but a businessman,'' said an executive at an international company here who asked that his name not be used. He teaches twice a week at Kyoto Industrial University, where his colleagues include Kei Wakaizumi, who also served as an intermediary for Prime Minister Sato with the Americans in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Outside Activities **********Among his outside activities, Mr. Takase is a director of a Tokyobased consulting and research company called Technova. ''The firm pays a monthly remuneration to the members of the board, including Takase,'' said Toshikazu Kurokawa, general manager of Technova. Mr. Kurokawa did not disclose the amount of the compensation. **********Earlier this month, it was announced that Technova and the Center for Japanese Studies at the University of Michigan would coordinate research for a two-year study of the auto industries in the United States and Japan designed to provide ''a foundation for understanding and cooperation.'' **********The project is being sponsored by major auto makers in the United States and Japan, according to Mr. Kurokawa, who would not estimate its total cost or the amount that Technova is likely to receive. He said the four sponsors were Toyota, Nissan, General Motors and Ford. **********Technova was set up May 1, 1978, with capital of 10 million yen ($43,000). Its 15-member advisory council includes such figures as Saburo Okita, a former Japanese Foreign Minister, and Kenzo Tange, Japan's leading architect. Several prominent professors also serve on the council, but the newly established research group is run by an eight-m@ember board, with Mr. Takase listed in its brochure as senior director, under the president. A Staff of About 20 **********The headquarters of the company is on the 13th floor of a new life insurance building in central Tokyo, and it has a staff of about 20, including the board. The office is spacious and smart. Technova has a branch in Paris but none in the United States. **********Technova has had a close working relationship with the Potomac International Corporation, a Washington-based consulting company that Mr. Allen owned until just before he joined the Reagan White House staff. **********Peter D. Hannaford, who bought the business from Mr. Allen, said in an interview that Mr. Allen, while he headed Potomac International, worked as a consultant for Technova and that the two companies had common clients. One of those clients, Mr. Hannaford said, was the Industrial Research Institute of Tokyo, an organization supported by Japanese utilities and energy companies. **********Mr. Hannaford was an aide to Mr. Reagan when he was Governor of California. **********''Potomac International has no branch in Tokyo,'' said a leading businessman, who asked to remain anonymous. ''Takase at this end is their man, people here believe,'' he said. Ties to Governing Party **********Mr. Takase attended Harvard's Yenching Institute, which specializes in Asian affairs, and then went to the Hoover Institute at Stanford University in 1955. He met Mr. Allen while working in charge of Japanese materials at Hoover, a research institute closely associated with American conservatives. Mr. Allen also worked at the institute in the late 1960's. **********Mr. Takase has depended on close ties to members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party in his work as a consultant. He was originally introduced to Cabinet ministers in the 1960's by Okinori Kaya, a right-wing member of the party, and was later close to members of the Seirankai, an extremist group in the party formed at a blood oath ceremony after the suicide of the novelist Yukio Mishima in 1970. **********Ithiro Nakagawa, currently Minister of Science and Technology, and once a leader of the now disbanded Seirankai, is said to be one of those closest to him in the party. Another associate is Shintaro Ishihara, a former novelist and friend of Mr. Mishima."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/22/business/american-express-to-buy-shearson-as-takeovers-transform-wall-st.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1981-04-22", "snippet": "The American Express Company will acquire Shearson Loeb Rhoades, Wall Street's second-largest brokerage firm, for about $915 million in stock, the two companies announced yesterday.", "word_count": 2089, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Express to Buy Shearson as Takeovers Transform Wall St.", "print_headline": "American Express to Buy Shearson as Takeovers Transform Wall St.", "body_text": " **********The American Express Company will acquire Shearson Loeb Rhoades, Wall Street's second-largest brokerage firm, for about $915 million in stock, the two companies announced yesterday. **********The resulting company will be one of the giants within a new industry of financial institutions that is transforming Wall Street by offering consumers and businesses a broad range of banking and financial services as well as traditional brokerage activities. **********Responding to the news that American Express had agreed to exchange its shares for Shearson's, Shearson stock jumped $6.38 a share, to $48.63, with 500,000 shares changing hands.

A mother awoke in a hospital room, eager to examine the photographs of her newborn child, snapped by her husband just hours earlier.  A Los Angeles man who evacuated his hillside home as a brush fire encroached, displayed snapshots of the fire to friends before returning to survey his home. **********These southern California residents are not professional photographers. They are, however, among the clients of One Hour Photo Developing Centers, a new chain of laboratories that can process and deliver color prints in an hour. **********Idea Started in Toronto **********The developing centers are owned by a California couple, Dr. Bruce Frome, 42 years old, an anesthesiologist, and his wife, Diane. The idea began when a cousin visited Toronto in November 1979 and saw a photo-finishing machine there deliver finished prints in less than an hour. He told the Fromes about it. They investigated the technology and last March opened their first store. **********''People were amazed,'' said Mrs. Frome, president of the chain.  ''They'd stop and read the signs mouthing the words 'Film developed in an hour.' They thought we must be kidding.'' **********That first store, in Encino, a Los Angeles suburb, cost almost $300,000 to open, which included $150,000 for equipment, $60,000 for the white-and-blue futuristic interior, $55,000 in advertising, $14,000 in inventory, and $8,000 for salary and other expenses. In 60 days, the Fromes say, the store turned a profit. **********The Fromes now operate four stores in southern California; three more are scheduled to open before the end of the year. Franchising Planned **********The Fromes plan to sell franchises for the labs around the country and perhaps even overseas. (Paris and London are favored as initial sites.) Their plans call for 220 outlets to be in operation by the end of 1981. **********For a $300,000 franchise fee, the Fromes will select the site for the store, furnish it, train up to 10 employees, supply the inventory, provide preliminary advertising and put $20,000 in the cash register for the opening day of business. **********The technology of the development process is not new. Two machines developed in the past year by a Japanese manufacturer, Noritsu Koki, can develop 110, 126 and color film in 32 minutes, although the Fromes have allowed an hour to include the handling time of the film. **********The film is placed on 35-millimeter film canisters and fed into a processor, where it is developed in 17 minutes. Then, each negative is individually analyzed to determine the amount of compensation necessary for each print. The pictures are then printed in 11 1/2 minutes by the printer/developer, packaged and delivered to the customer. The labs can develop as many as 50 rolls of film an hour. Method of Analysis Disputed **********The Fromes say their machines produce high-quality prints, as good as if not better than their leading competitors, including Eastman Kodak and the Fotomat Corporation. They stress, for example, the individual analysis performed on each negative. But according to their competitors, computer analysis of negatives rather than hand analysis produces superior prints. **********''There are two ways to analyze negatives - by hand and by machine,'' said Richard Irwin, president of Fotomat. ''We, like other large photo finishers, use automatic printers controlled by computers. The computer analyzes each negative in at least 100 places and then makes a judgment on how to print the negatives.'' **********The Fromes also say that their service is competitive in price.  Their chain charges 29 cents a print plus $1.99 for processing.  Fotomat charges 35 cents a print plus $1.85 for processing, and an additional $1.50 for overnight service. Eastman Kodak charges 23 cents a print and $1.60 for processing. **********Although the new stores do offer the consumer a shorter waiting time, the one-hour photo developing centers are not yet considered a threat by their established competitors, including the Polaroid Corporation, which has been catering directly to the instant-picture market. **********''We haven't noticed, nor do we expect, any effect at all on us,'' said Donald A. Dery, a Polaroid spokesman.  ''They offer a beneficial service to the consumer and that's beneficial to the industry,'' said Tim Elliott, a spokesman for Eastman Kodak at the company's Rochester headquarters. ''We don't expect any significant adverse effect on our business.'' **********The Fromes, however, are banking on consumers who care about getting their film back almost immediately. ''The industry seems to think that people don't care when they get their film back,'' Mrs.  Frome said. ''Well, they've been in the darkroom too long.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/03/business/800-more-layoffs-planned-by-deere.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "800 More Layoffs Planned by Deere", "print_headline": "800 More Layoffs Planned by Deere", "body_text": " **********Deere & Company, a large manufacturer of farm equipment, diesel engines, transmissions and other major components for tractors and construction equipment, said it will place 800 more employees on indefinite layoff in the next four months as it reduces production of large farm tractors beginning in February. **********About 120 will be laid off at the foundry in East Moline, and the balance will be laid off at Deere's manufacturing complex in Waterloo, Iowa, a Deere spokesman said. **********In addition, the Waterloo operations will be closed for two weeks beginning in March, the company said. **********Of Deere's total work force of slightly more than 15,000, about 1,275 employees currently are on layoff at the Waterloo factories and about 50 at East Moline."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/24/business/acme-general-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-25.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ACME GENERAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 25", "print_headline": "ACME GENERAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 25", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/31/business/super-food-services-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-21.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SUPER FOOD SERVICES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 21", "print_headline": "SUPER FOOD SERVICES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 21", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/22/business/advertising-los-angeles-agency-gains-tyco-account.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Los Angeles Agency Gains Tyco Account", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Los Angeles Agency Gains Tyco Account", "body_text": " **********Scott Lancaster Mills Atha, a Los Angeles agency, has been named to the Tyco Industries toy account and has changed its name by adding Jackman in the middle. **********The story behind the new name -Scott Lancaster Jackman Mills Atha -is an interesting one. **********The agency was begun five years ago by four people out of Gumpertz, Bentley, Fried, Scott, where each had worked on Tyco business. **********Their contact at the client company was Robert A.

IC, in anticipation of Allegheny's entry yesterday, acted a day earlier, sweetening its earlier offer of $32, to $36 a share.  It was the first phase of IC's two-part merger plan that would involve some $480 million in cash and stock. **********Allegheny abruptly bid $38. It was the first phase of Allegheny's two-part merger plan that would involve approximately $521 million in cash and stock. **********The agreement as announced called for Allegheny to make an immediate public offer to pay $38 a share for up to 7.5 million Sunbeam shares. In a merger to come later, Allegheny would swap 36 one-hundredths of a new convertible preferred share for each Sunbeam share. The preferred stock theoretically is valued at $38, but because it yields only 11 1/4 percent interest, it was valued at roughly $31.50 to compensate for the yield. **********IC already owns 681,500 shares, or about 4.5 percent of Sunbeam, and is offering $36 each for 7.25 million shares, which would give it 53 percent. Its merger plan, which remained unchanged, called for a share-for-share stock swap. Although the stock price changes daily, IC rose $1.63 yesterday, to $32, in a move that some analysts said meant that IC's chances of landing Sunbeam had diminished. **********Allegheny's shares fell $2.88, to $36.63 a share, while Sunbeam's advanced $5.13, to $35.13, with more that a million shares changing hands. **********In a related move, intended to strengthen Allegheny's hand, Sunbeam agreed to sell 2.75 million new Sunbeam shares to Allegheny at $36 a share, giving Allegheny what would be 15 1/2 percent of the company after the shares were issued. The agreement -binding on both Sunbeam and Allegheny unless there are antitrust problems - could be construed as a hurdle for IC. Sunbeam's charter provides that at least 75 percent of its shareholders must approve any merger and 15 1/2 percent in Allegheny hands would mean that IC would have to get practically all the remaining votes to win. **********IC said only that it was studying the new development, but it did not appear yet that IC was conceding anything. In what was becoming a kind of chess game between IC and Allegheny, sources close to IC maintained that the battle would be fought over the first 50 percent of Sunbeam and that the bidder with the best price would win. **********This raised the possibility that should IC further sweeten its offer and Allegheny not outbid it, IC might land a big chunk of Sunbeam and Allegheny might be left with just the 15 1/2 percent it contracted to buy. Even so, according to sources close to Allegheny, since Sunbeam's directors serve staggered terms - with just a few being elected every year - even if IC landed a big block of Sunbeam, it would have to wait at least until 1983 to control Sunbeam. **********A hearing had been scheduled in the Federal District Court in Chicago yesterday on a motion by Sunbeam to delay the IC offer, but IC said Sunbeam had requested a postponement. Both sides will convene in court tomorrow to decide whether to reschedule the hearing. **********Until Allegheny's entry, Sunbeam shareholders had until midnight last night to withdraw shares sent to IC, if they wanted to do so, but the new bidder automatically extend's IC's withdrawal date to midnight Oct. 27. **********Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Allegheny has obtained written committments from 13 banks for $490 million on the basis of 90-day unsecured notes. **********Allegheny's $38 offer for 7.5 million Sunbeam shares involves only $285 million, Its agreement to buy stock from Sunbeam would cost $99 million but only 10 percent would be in cash. Even then, should Allegheny land Sunbeam, all of the funds would flow back to Allegheny. **********On the other hand, should IC win, IC would have to buy the shares from Allegheny, thus making the cost at least $100 million higher to Allegheny than to IC. **********As pieced together from a number of sources, nine days after IC first approached Sunbeam, the First Boston Corporation called Robert J. Buckley, chairman of Allegheny, to propose a merger with Sunbeam. **********By Oct. 5, Mr. Buckley met with Sunbeam's chairman, Robert P.  Gwinn, in the offices of Morgan Stanley & Company, Sunbeam's adviser. A few days later, the two talked by phone to discuss the terms. **********It had been agreed in advance that while the two chief executives would discuss the terms, the final offer -when it came - would be made only at Sunbeam's Columbus Day board meeting. Fredlock F. Babb, Allegheny's treasurer, acting on behalf of Mr. Buckley, who he said was away on business, stated that he made the $38-a-share offer personally to Mr. Gwinn outside the board meeting. **********The stakes are also high for the Wall Street advisers, with Lazard Freres to get a $3 million fee if IC wins and First Boston to get $3 million if Allegheny wins. Morgan Stanley, as adviser to Sunbeam, would get at least $2.5 million, regardless of which bidder wins."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/05/business/sulfur-price-raised-by-elf.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sulfur Price Raised by Elf", "print_headline": "Sulfur Price Raised by Elf", "body_text": " **********By Reuters **********Two months after being acquired by Societe National Elf Aquitaine, the Frenc h st ate-owned oil concern, Texasgulf Corporation said yesterday tha t it had raised the price of sulfur by $10 a ton, to $150, effecti ve immeidately. **********The rise drew immediate criticism by the International Minerals and Chemical Corporation, a major consumer of sulfur for its fertilizer operations. **********The Northbrook, Ill., company said it had sent telegrams to about 200 Congressmen and Cabinet officers protesting the increase. **********Elf paid about $2.8 billion in a tender offer last July for all of Texasgulf's stock except a 37 percent stake held by the Canada Development Corporation.

They were to depart tonight after the State Department raised questions about their status. **********The Administration said the five officers had applied for diplomatic visas through the American Embassy in Pretoria under what one official called ''misleading circumstances.'' The South African Foreign Ministry was said to have asked that they be given visas to consult with the South African Embassy in Washington. **********The whole matter is being treated very cautiously by the Administration. A reason for the extreme sensitivity seems to be that many of President Reagan's supporters have advocated a less hostile relationship with South Africa and Mr. Reagan himself has recently made some conciliatory statements about the South African Government. State Dept. Confirms Account **********The following account has been confirmed by the State Department and independently by other Administration officials: Upon arrival in Washington, the officers were said by Administration officials to have met some members of Congress through the auspices of individuals favorable to an improvement in relations between the United States and South Africa. **********One Administration official said that the American Security Council, a private group that espouses conservative views, played a role. It was not possible to reach any officers of that group by telephone this afternoon. **********An appointment was made for the five military officers to meet with a senior State Department official who was not identified, but shortly before they were to arrive at the State Department yesterday, the African Bureau of the department discovered who they were. When they entered the lobby of the department they were told that the appointment had been canceled. **********Subsequently, the department learned that one of the group paid what was described as ''a courtesy call'' on an official at the Defense Intelligence Agency at the Pentagon and on a staff officer at the National Security Council. When the State Department raised the matter of their status with the South African Embassy this morning and asked when they were leaving, it was told that they were leaving tonight to return to South Africa. The embassy had no comment. Some officials were upset at the developments because the South Africans seemed to be trying to initiate contacts through military channels at a time when future policy toward South Africa is one of the most sensitive questions facing the Reagan Administration, given traditional American opposition to South Africa's apartheid, or racial separation. Concern in Washington **********There was concern at the State Department that the visit not be interpreted as having been initiated by Washington. Officials insisted that it had not occurred with the advance knowledge of the Administration. **********But the trip of the five officers occurred at a time when some African specialists have been led to believe that the Reagan Administration intends to take steps to improve ties with the South African Government. The Carter Administration had very chilly relations with South Africa and imposed a total ban on all military sales to that country because of its apartheid policy. **********The Carter Administration was also very concerned about the possibility of South Africa developing nuclear weapons.  James P. Lucier, an aide to Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, arranged a meeting on Capitol Hill for three members of the group with several staff assistants. Mr. Helms did not meet with the South Africans. **********A participant in the meeting said that the officers had told of what they perceived to be a growing Soviet threat to Africa, particuarly in such places as Angola and Namibia, which are of particular concern to South Africa. One staff assistant said that the South Africans met at least one Cabinet member, but he would not identify him. **********President Reagan, in an interview with Walter Cronkite broadcast by CBS News on March 3, said that there had been ''a failure'' in the United States to ''recognize how many people, black and white in South Africa, are trying to remove apartheid and the steps that they've taken and the gains that they've made.'' **********''As long as there's a sincere and honest effort being made, based on our own experience in our own land, it would seem to me that we should be trying to be helpful,'' the President said. **********Mr. Reagan asked: ''Can we abandon a country that has stood beside us in every war we've ever fought, a country that strategically is essential to the free world? It has production of minerals we all must have and so forth?'' **********''I just feel that, myself, that here, if we're going to sit down at a table and negotiate with the Russians, surely we can keep the door open and continue to negotiate with a friendly nation like South Africa,'' he concluded. Preliminary Policy Conclusions **********State Department officials said that while the Reagan Administration had not concluded an overall policy review for southern Africa, of which policy toward South Africa is part, some preliminary conclusions have been reached. **********In essence, the official said, it is that although the United States cannot accept apartheid as such, it is important to approach South Africa from the point of view of ''constructive engagement'' rather than ''confrontation.'' **********But there has been no change in the regulations barring any military sales, officials said.There have been other signs recently that have been interpreted as indicating that the Administration was considering changes. These include the possibility of asking Congress to revoke the amendment barring aid to opposition groups in Angola. **********A key question that has not been answered yet is what approach the United States will take to the effort to bring independence to Namibia, also known by its colonial name of South-West Africa. The United States had been part of a Western effort, working through the United Nations, to bring about South Africa's disengagement from that territory. **********But no developments are expected until after South Africa's elections next month, officials said.  As to the visit of the five military officers, State Department officials expressed some puzzlement. They said they were not sure of the purpose of the mission or why South Africa resorted to misleading efforts to gain entry to the United States. **********''It's not as if we've been trying to stiff-arm South Africa,'' an official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/10/business/the-textile-industry-shakes-itself-up.html": {"writer_name": "Sandra Salmans", "pub_date": "1981-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2900, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Textile Industry Shakes Itself Up", "print_headline": "The Textile Industry Shakes Itself Up", "body_text": " **********The yarn whips across the Nissan loom 10 times a second, piling up cloth at the rate of 12 inches a minute. A jet of water propels each strand, driving it across the face of the fabric three times faster than the fastest shuttle loom - and far less noisily. It is quiet enough to hear the robots beep as they wheel down the wide aisles, picking up rolls of finished cloth and carting them off to the trucks. **********Experts say that this is the most advanced textile factory anywhere. Opened one and a half years ago by Burlington Industries, the largest textile manufacturer in the world, this $40 million plant contains the latest technology in the industry. It replaces a turn-of-the-century mill down the road, which produced one-fourth as much fabric with the same 800 employees. **********It is on this factory, and others nearly as modern, that the American textile industry is pinning its hopes for survival and future prosperity. **********Progressiveness and prosperity have not been virtues traditionally associated with textiles, especially in this Piedmont country that is the heart of the industry. What has tended to characterize textile manufacturers, rather, are father-and-son management, unimaginative marketing and an anti-union militance made infamous by J.P. Stevens, the second-largest publicly held textile company. Propagated by ''Norma Rae,'' the movie based on the Stevens labor dispute, the industry's reputation for backwardness has clung as persistently as cotton dust. **********Recently, however, the textile business has been undergoing a technological, managerial and marketing revolution. Instead of merely flailing against imports, it is starting to sell goods abroad. It is bringing in professional management. And it is continuing to invest in new technology, with the result that its productivity is outpacing that of United States manufacturing overall. In the 1980's, analysts say, the textile industry should be more competitive and - a quality that has also long been elusive - profitable. **********''They've been through labor problems, government regulations problems, and they've learned to cope with them,'' said Freddie Wood, a senior vice president of Kurt Salmon Associates, an Atlanta-based textile and apparel management consulting firm. ''I'm more bullish on the textile industry than I've been in many years.'' **********But the technology that is increasing productivity and exports, textile executives say, is also spelling the beginning of the end for a number of small companies, which have traditionally been a main part of the textile industry. And in the short term, the industry's prospects inspire less enthusiasm. **********With cutbacks in consumer spending in the United States and Europe, textile mills used only 72 percent of their factory capacity in February, the third straight monthly decline, according to the Johnson Redbook, a research service specializing in apparel, textiles, retail and chemical industries. For 1980, capacity use averaged 77.2 percent, compared with 85.6 percent in 1979. **********Orders for denim and corduroy have dropped the most precipitously, hurting specialty manufacturers such as Cone Mills and Crompton, which had profited from the worldwide jeans craze. **********Nor is it difficult to see new problems ahead. The weak dollar and controlled oil prices, two advantages that American textile manufacturers have historically held over foreign competition, have recently been lost. Apparel imports continue to rise at an alarming rate, reducing sales of United States apparel manufacturers and thus eroding an important market. **********Furthermore, the industry's profitability and return on investment, which have traditionally been well below the average for United States manufacturing, are becoming more critical to its survival, analysts say. Because of the huge sums that it must invest in technology, ''the big problem facing the industry in the 1980's will be the generation of cash flow necessary to stay in business,'' said Jay Meltzer, a textile analyst for Goldman, Sachs. ''Those that don't, will fall by the way.'' **********At Burlington's state-of-the-art plant here, however, it is easy to be optimistic about the future of American textiles. The mill's main product, an all-polyester fabric that is known in the trade as textured woven, buys man-made fiber from Du Pont that is made more cheaply in this country than anywhere else. The fabric can be manufactured at top speeds, wide widths and in long runs, and it is thus the sort of product for which America's textile mills are uniquely equipped. **********Each week, the Rockingham mill weaves 1.8 million yards of this fabric. The cloth sells to such major United States apparel manufacturers as Levi Strauss and Haggar, as well as to foreign customers. Originally, 1,000 people were to be hired to run the mill, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, ''but the technology is so good that we saved 20 percent of the labor,'' said Dale Ormsby, mill manager. Nor was there any labor trouble when the new technology was introduced; like most of the mills, the Burlington plant is not unionized. **********Ironically, Burlington and other big American textile manufacturers owe their dazzling efficiency largely to foreign technology. West German-made Barmag machines, priced at upward of $500,000, process the polyester fiber at a rate of 700 meters every minute -heating it, stretching it and putting in a twist. The yarn it produces is fed into some 700 Japanese-made Nissan looms, costing roughly $36,000 apiece, which weave it into fabric with the help of Staubli warpcontrol machinery from Switzerland. **********According to the American Textile Manufacturers Institute in Washington, approximately half of the fortune spent by the industry on new machinery - this year alone, the industry is investing an estimated $1.6 billion on new plants and equipment - is going abroad. While manufacturers still buy materials handling equipment, compressors, combers and some less sophisticated machinery in the United States, the pride of the mills in the Carolinas these days comes from West Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, Japan and even Britain. **********Textile manufacturers are going abroad because, they complain, the best technology is not available here at any price. ''In the 1950's, we bought most of our machinery in the United States,'' recalled Duke Kimbrell, president of Parkdale Mills, a $120 million-a-year yarn spinning company based in Gastonia, N.C. ''Then all the manufacturers were bought by conglomerates, stopped doing research and just sold machines.'' **********For his open-end spinning operation (a form of yarn spinning vastly more efficient than the traditional ring spinning), Mr. Kimbrell bought 30 Toyoda frames from Japan. When the yarn breaks, Schlafhorsts, German-made robots, deftly tie the strands together. In the last 16 months, Parkdale has bought eight Schlafhorsts at $386,000 apiece, and has four more on order. ''In cost per pound, we can match anything they're doing in Japan,'' he said. **********Thanks to such investment, the industry's record on productivity is one of the strongest at home and abroad. Despite occasional slumps in actual production during recessions such as in 1975, productivity has been rising at an annual rate of 4 percent for the last 20 years, an economist at the textile institute said. According to a study conducted last year by Werner Management Consultants, the United States textile industry has the highest average productivity for spinning and weaving, by a substantial margin. **********The American companies also have an edge in labor costs. Of the 864,000 workers currently employed in textile manufacturing - down from the 1973 peak of 1 million - fewer than 15 percent are unionized. And despite the much-publicized battle between Stevens and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, the work force remains relatively docile - and inexpensive. ''The European textile industry is unbelievably mesmerized by social benefits,'' said William Lord 2d, chief executive of Crompton. **********After years of indifference to, or distrust of, overseas markets, American manufacturers of yarn, fabrics and household textiles have begun actively courting foreign buyers. In 1980, they increased their exports by 14 percent, to a record $3.6 billion. That followed a year of even more dramatic growth, when exports rose by 43 percent - admittedly, from a very low base. **********Cannon and Fieldcrest, two leading household textile manufacturers, are selling their high-fashion sheets and towels abroad.  Americanmade rugs and carpets, which took a beating when the United States housing construction went into a slump last year, near doubled their exports, to 75 million square yards. The stylish, relatively inexpensive carpets were snapped up by Canada, Britain and Saudi Arabia, where construction is booming. **********The biggest beneficiaries of the export boom, of course, have been manufacturers of denim and corduroy, where a made-in-America label carries a cachet even if the jeans themselves are manufactured in Hong Kong. Crompton's exports, for example, are now running at about 25 percent of sales - a falloff from their 33 percent mark in 1979, before the European recession. **********Arguably the industry's strongest proponent of exporting, Mr. Lord said that his goal is to sell as much as half of Crompton's production abroad, and he is setting his sights on the Far East.  From its office in Hong Kong, Crompton is trying to peddle its corduroy and velveteen to the same Asian clothing manufacturers who have been overwhelming the American apparel trade. ''Down the road, the business is going to be re-exporting from the Far East to affluent markets, including America and Europe,'' Mr. Lord said.  ''Exporting to Europe is fun, but exporting to the Pacific Basin will be a matter of economic survival.'' **********Even relatively small companies are starting to hustle. In March, about a dozen yarn spinners embarked on their first trade mission to Hong Kong and China. ''There's an awful lot of folks over there to keep clothed,'' said Jim Conner, executive director of the American Yarn Spinners Association in Charlotte, N.C., who organized the expedition. **********Today, there are still an estimated 6,000 separate textile manufacturers in the United States; even Burlington, the giant with sales last year of $2.9 billion, had only 6 percent of the business.  But consolidation, which has been taking place steadily, has been accelerated by the industry's increasing capital-intensiveness. By one estimate, it will force as many as one-third of the companies out of business by 1990. In fact, Robert Coleman, chairman of Riegel and current president of the textile institute, predicts that there will be mergers even among the top 20 textile makers. **********''It takes a lot of money today to buy equipment,'' said Charles McLendon of Burlington, which invested $215 million on new plants and equipment last year and has budgeted more than $200 million for 1981. ''Small companies can still buy used equipment to start up, but that will happen less and less.'' **********The cost of capital is forcing larger companies to rationalize, too. Increasingly, analysts say, they are narrowing their product lines to a handful of areas where they are assured a large market share. ''If the company can't be a major factor, it's choosing to walk away from the business,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, textile analyst for Dean Witter. Frequently, the business being walked away from is apparel textiles, where imports have had their largest impact. In one of its mills, for example, West Point-Pepperell has converted its shirting line to sheets, where the outlook is brighter. **********Such changes have been facilitated by the entry of professional management into an industry once dominated by fathers and sons. In the last two decades, a number of companies - notably Cannon, Cone, Riegel and Springs - have come under professional management, and many that are still family-controlled are paying more attention to M.B.A. techniques. ''They seem to be running their companies better,'' said Mr. Edelman. **********Shake-out and specialization are just what the industry needs, according to Mr. Wood, the management consultant. ''Historically, the industry's basic problem has been overcapacity,'' he said. ''It is shaking down into a rational industry, with a half-dozen companies making towels, a few making denim.'' For the survivors, ''the 1980's will be a much more profitable decade,'' he added. **********Precisely how profitable, however, is hard to predict. One imponderable is the cost to be borne to clear the air of cotton dust, associated with the respiratory ailment, byssinosis. In recent years, manufacturers say, they have been spending up to 25 percent of their capital outlay to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. **********Last month, however, O.S.H.A. announced that it had decided to review its standard for protection of workers to determine whether the costs of the rule justified the benefits. While labor groups have protested the decision, industry executives say that they are hopeful for some relief. **********Textile executives caution that the export bubble could be pricked by the resurgence of the dollar and the decontrol of the price of oil, a prime feedstock for synthetic fibers. At Cannon, where exports are targeted to rise by 20 to 25 percent annually for the next three years, ''a stronger dollar could hurt us,'' cautioned Otto Stolz, the company's chairman and president. One of the newer breed of managers, Mr. Stolz, a New Jersey-born former Washington lawyer, is the first outsider to run the company. **********Apart from the denim and corduroy specialty manufacturers, moreover, few companies view exports as more than a bonus or a comfortable buffer against downturns in the domestic market.  Burlington, whose exports are currently running at a respectable 7 percent of total sales, has stated that exports are unlikely to exceed 10 percent of total sales in the future. And even Mr. Lord of Crompton noted that some Asian countries have virtually closed their markets to American imports. ''You can't get a yard of goods into South Korea with a shoehorn,'' he said. **********Some are even more blunt about the possibilities of markets abroad: ''Exports are the big myth of the time,'' said Mr. Edelman.  ''They're not the big savior of the industry.'' **********Apparel imports, meanwhile, grew by 8 percent last year, to 20 percent of all clothing sold in this country. With the entry of China, the industry fears, imports could reach 40 or 50 percent by the end of this century. That is bad news for United States apparel manufacturers and, of course, for the people who sell them their cloth. ''Every time one of our customers goes out of business, that's a sale we've lost forever,'' said Mr. Conner of the yarn spinners association. ''There's no way we can survive without them.'' **********Accordingly, the textile industry has joined apparel makers in clamoring for a more restrictive policy on imports from the low-wage regions, particularly the so-called ''Big Three'': Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong. With the present Multi-Fiber Arrangement, the international agreement signed by both importing and exporting nations, expiring at the end of the year, negotiations on the next M.F.A. opened in Geneva last week. The industry is lobbying for an agreement that would limit annual import growth to the growth of the United States market. **********Ultimately, could the textile industry be more directly threatened by imports? ''The import problem is an apparel problem, not a textile problem,'' Mr. Wood said, noting that importers have concentrated on the labor-intensive garment manufacturing. Most analysts and manufacturers, arguing that low-wage manufacturers won't receive an adequate pay-off for such large investment, believe that the American industry will be able to maintain its technological and cost advantage. **********Mr. Stolz of Cannon is less confident. Asia ''can buy those looms in Germany and Switzerland, just as we can,'' he said. ''And they don't need our air-cleaning equipment.'' **********Against that day, he added, he is doing everything to fortify Cannon -strengthening its brand name, improving productivity, increasing exports. ''You've got to do all those things when imports are insignificant,'' he said. ''If Cannon is successful with its program, we should be able to deal with imports when they make a major push.''  TEXTILESAT A GLANCE **********Last year, there were 6,000 companies around the nation with 7,200 plants employing 864,000 people, producing 24 billion square yards of material and racking up total sales of $44.9 billion, according to the American Textile Manufacturers Institute. **********The mills consumed 8.6 billion pounds of man-made fibers, 3 billion pounds of cotton and 1.2 million pounds of wool. Of the finished product, 42 percent went into apparel, 30 percent into home furnishings, 23 percent into industrial and other consumer uses and 5 percent into exports. **********The Southeast is the home for the majority of textile companies, 47 percent of which are in that area. The Mid-Atlantic states account for another 32 percent, with the rest of the industry scattered about the nation. **********The top 10 textile states, in terms of numbers of people employed by the industry are: North Carolina 254,000 South Carolina 142,000 Georgia 116,000 Pennsylvania 51,000 Alabama 44,000 Virginia 44,000 New York 42,000 Massachusetts 28,000 Tennessee 27,000 New Jersey 23,000 The top 10 companies, in terms of 1980 sales, are: Burlington Industries $2,901 million J.P.

Fans of Frequency Electronics say this New Hyde Park, L.I., atomic clock company justifiably carries a multiple of 50 - a multiple higher than that accorded to all but the most promising of companies. **********Two years ago, that multiple would have been absurd since this high-technology company earned modest profits on sophisticated timing devices produced by the handful for the Apollo moon shots and other space programs of the 1960's and 1970's. **********But about a year and a half ago, the Government began specifying ultra-precision timing and frequency control devices for encoded military communications, for navigation and for guidance systems.  Frequency Electronics, a leader in these fields, began to experience a sales bonanza. **********At $14.2 million, sales in the fiscal year ended April 30 were up more than 50 percent from the $9.3 million reported in the prior fiscal year. Meantime, income nearly tripled, reaching $2.2 million, up from $784,000. Even adjusting for an additional 500,000 shares offered to the public last November (adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split in April) that raised capitalization to 2.4 million shares, earnings per share were up 130 percent. **********But the skeptical, viewing the stock at 49 on earnings of 90 cents a share, might think Frequency Electronics to be a short sale. And there is evidence from the floor of the American Stock Exchange that short sellers are becoming active in the stock. **********Frequency Electronics is moving into a larger plant in Mitchell Field, L.I., next December, which will increase the company's shipping capacity to $125 million a year, up from $25 million now.  Presumably, it will be years before Frequency Electronics reaches that sales level. **********Speaking generally with regard to rapidly growing young companies, analysts are quick to point out that problems often develop at some point - usually at around the $100 million sales level. **********Further, Frequency Electronics shares have experienced a two-and-ahalf-fold price increase in four months and could fall prey to profit-taking. **********The shareholders experienced dilution again in June when the company offered 334,000 new shares at 40, raising capitalization to almost 2.9 million shares. **********The skeptics also note that, with a total market capitalizaiton of $145 million - 10 times sales -there is not much room for such disappointments as a lag in earnings. **********In any event, there are two major reports out on the stock that find the shares attractive at current levels. One is by Stanley J.  Goldring, who follows the company for Advest Inc., a New York Stock Exchange member firm. **********Mr. Goldring notes that Frequency Electronics controls the market for military ultra-precision time and frequency control devices since Hewlett-Packard, the company's major competition, has withdrawn from that sector of the market. **********Frequency Electronics products are quartz crystal and cesium beam atomic clocks - timing devices with accuracies up to 10-billionth of a second. The devices allow a navigator to determine position with heretofore unattainable accuracy. In a different form, they allow military cryptographers to divide speech into minute portions for encoded communication. **********The company serves three major military programs. The first is Navstar, which, in Defense Department planning, is called the non-Communist world's military navigation system for the 1980's and 1990's. **********The second is the The Tiger secured digital multiplex communication system, which provides nonvoice data transmission capability for satellite and military uses. The third major military application is quartz crystal oscillators for tail warning radar systems on fighter aircraft. **********Mr. Goldring has written that sales of these three programs could reach $2.5 billion to $3 billion by mid-decade, up from $150 million today. He argues that these are high-priority items that would not be affected by defense cutbacks mandated by Congress or under a different national Administration. **********The analyst adds that the company should not need additional capital since Government prepayments provide 85 percent of its working capital needs. The company is debt-free and has $17 million in cash. **********He is expecting Frequency Electronics earnings to nearly double in the fiscal year that began May 1, 1981, to $1.75 a share on $25 million in sales. He expects the company to maintain a 100 percent earnings growth rate for several years to come and to earn $10 to $15 a share by 1985-86. **********Michael Carstens, who follows the company for A.G. Becker & Company, believes that Frequency Electronics is ''uniquely situated'' to benefit from an expected tenfold to twentyfold expansion of the high precision frequency and time control device market over the next five to six years. **********If the analysts are correct, the current price-earnings ratio will drop dramatically in just a few short years if the share price holds steady."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/10/business/dutch-joblessness-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 40, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dutch Joblessness Up", "print_headline": "Dutch Joblessness Up", "body_text": " **********Dutch unemployment rose to a post-World War II record of 435,400 in November from 423,300 in October, the Social Affairs Ministry said today.

The weakness in auto sales and house buying caused by high interest rates could spread to other consumer durable goods, the advisers said. **********Administration officials reported the essence of the appraisal as part of a White House drive to prepare Congress for more cuts in the budget, including military spending. **********Dismayed and frustrated by the continuous rise of interest rates in recent weeks despite slower inflation and deep budget cuts by Congress, David A. Stockman, the budget director, and other senior aides have concluded that the Government - White House and Congress - must make an even greater show of willingness to tighten spending and hold down the budget deficit. **********As politically risky as this may be for Mr. Reagan and Republican hopes of winning control of the House in 1982, the President's advisers have concluded that there is nothing else to do. 'Time Is Now' **********The new emphasis on interest rates was reflected in remarks by two senior Congressional leaders who conferred with Mr. Reagan at the White House yesterday. Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader, said, ''The time is now to address the high interest rates and get them down.'' **********Chastising the financial community, Senator Baker said, ''It's time they pulled their oar.'' ''We can't live with a 20 pe rcent prime rat e and expect to see any economic recovery,'' the House minority leade r, Representative Bob Michel of Illinois, said. **********Administration economists indicated that their own prognosis was almost as grave. They said there was a good chance that the fourthquarter economic upturn predicted by the Administration in July might not occur and that the first quarter of 1982 might also be lackluster. **********With private analysts revising their 1982 forecasts downward, Mr.  Reagan was told, the Administration's July prediction of 3.4 percent real economic growth in 1982 ''is at the high end of the range.'' **********A new forecast has not been prepared formally, but informal calculations show the 1982 gain might slip to 2 percent, officials said. That would imply higher unemployment, they said, but no new unemployment estimates were given to Mr. Reagan. **********The July 15 prediction, part of the midyear budget review, was that the unemployment rate would climb to 7.7 percent by the fourth quarter of 1981 -it was 7.2 percent in August - and fall to 7 percent by late 1982. Hopes for Help From Fed **********Officials said the July forecast also looked high now because it assumed a 10 percent income tax cut would take effect July 1, a position the Administration abandoned early in June when it switched to the 5 percent cut on Oct.1 that Congress enacted. **********Administration economists are guardedly hopeful that they will get some help from the Federal Reserve soon in the shape of slightly faster growth of the money supply, which by some measures has fallen below the central bank's target path. **********But the officials fear that the money markets may construe such a change as indicating that the Federal Reserve has lost its courage and is backing away from continued slow growth of money to combat inflation. **********Such an interpretation - misinterpretation, officials say - could drive interest rates up.  Mr. Reagan was told that autumn was the customary season for corporations to draw up capital spending budgets for the following year. Consequently, the aides said, the persistence of high interest rates for a few more weeks could hold back the surge in business investment in 1982 that was expected to result from the more generous investment write-offs authorized in the 1981 tax bill. Driving Up the Deficit **********The aides also reported to Mr. Reagan that even some of this year's good economic news could drive up the budget deficit in the 1982 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. **********The official forecast is $42.5 billion, but other estimates range $15 billion or more higher.  Revenues may run below expectations, the advisers said, because the weakening of oil prices - which has helped to slow inflation - has cut into receipts from the ''windfall profits'' tax. Similarly, lower inflation probably means some loss in corporate tax payments. **********The bumper grain crop that has helped to moderate food prices, the President was told, has led to a large"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/12/business/judy-s-foods-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JUDY'S FOODS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 30", "print_headline": "JUDY'S FOODS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/11/world/around-the-world-afghan-riots-reported-over-call-up-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Afghan Riots Reported Over Call-Up Plan", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Afghan Riots Reported Over Call-Up Plan", "body_text": " **********Street protests erupted in the Afghan capital of Kabul this week, including one in which four people were wounded when the police opened fire, diplomatic sources said here today. **********The demonstrations, which involved many women, were apparently to protest the Government's decision Monday to call up young retired soldiers to bolster the Afghan Army against rebel guerrillas, they said. **********In one protest by several hundred people on Tuesday, four people were wounded when the police opened fire, the sources said.

But lately, real-life Hollywood has been intruding on the largest manufacturer of wool textiles in Britain. **********The company, Illingworth, Morris, produces some of the world's best-known names in textiles, such as Huddersfield worsteds and Scottish Crombie wool for overcoats. It also makes the covering for Dunlop tennis balls, lining for Rolls-Royces, and cloth for papal vestments and the uniforms of guards at Buckingham Palace. Its roots run deep in the rich history of one of this country's bedrock industries -the company's headquarters enjoin a 125-year-old mill in this town about 200 miles north of London. **********But Illingworth's most powerful shareholder is Pamela Mason, a 58-year-old television talk show personality, denizen of Beverly Hills and ex-wife of film star James Mason. As executor of her father's estate, she effectively has a controlling interest. Her son, Morgan Mason, 25, who has been active as a fund raiser for the Presidential campaign of fellow Californian Ronald Reagan, is on the board. **********Under the suddenly active direction of Mrs. Mason, Illingworth has recently been acting out of character. At the annual meeting last September, she abruptly dismissed the company's long-time auditors, investment bankers and stockbrokers, and appointed to the board a fellow expatriate, Thomas Yeardye, a former executive of Vidal Sassoon, a maker of cosmetics and owner of a chain of hair dresser salons. **********''I want to get this company off its butt,'' Mrs. Mason said at the time, adding recently that the company ''needed to consolidate manufacturing and look for new markets.'' **********For Illingworth, that has mainly meant moving into the United States. In March, it set up a company under New York designer Leon Block to manufacture women's wear there from top-quality Illingworth textiles. Nancy Reagan, wife of the Presidential candidate, has already bought 10 of the suits, which retail for about $400 each.  Illingworth expects to set up another company by year-end and also has acquisition plans. **********Such sudden moves, after years of quiescence, have surprised Illingworth's rivals as well as financial analysts. Some applaud Mrs. Mason for making the company more aggressive, but some doubt that Mr. Yeardye and Mr. Mason are the right men for the job. Others are even more skeptical. ''Illingworth's management clearly needs a bomb behind them,'' said David Buck, of Laing & Cruickshank, a stock brokerage firm in London. ''But I'm not sure that Mrs. Mason is the right kind of bomb.'' **********Although Mrs. Mason inherited control of the company when her father and uncle died in 1976, what provoked her recent interest was a blot of red ink on the company's balance sheet last fiscal year. In the year ended March 31, Illingworth lost $3.2 million on sales that declined 9 percent, to $238 million, which compared with an aftertax profit of $5.8 million in fiscal 1979 - itself a 13 percent decline from the previous fiscal year. **********Illingworth is not the only British wool textile company in distress. The industry is still Britain's sixth-largest exporter, having sold $912 million worth of goods abroad last year of its total production of $2.8 billion. But it has been in steady decline since World War II, and the downturn has accelerated in the last five years. **********Compounding the problems of the strong pound, soaring inflation and high interest rates, which make British goods less competitive on the world market and are afflicting most industries here, a handful of other factors are bringing Britain's wool textile manufacturers to their knees. The important Iranian market, a particularly large consumer of British wool textiles before the Islamic revolution, has collapsed, and the attractive United States market has been virtually closed to foreign manufacturers through a prohibitive 50 percent tariff on wool and worsted fabrics. **********At home, top-quality British suits have been shouldered aside by Italian imports, generally rated superior in design - although companies here charge that the Italians' major advantage is their evasion of some taxes and their failure to pay certain employee benefits. The lower end of the market is also being flooded with European imports, many of which, British manufacturers charge, are actually made in East Germany, Poland and other Communist-bloc countries. **********As a result, companies in West Yorkshire - the heart of the British wool textile trade - are closing mills and laying off workers at an unprecedented rate. Since the start of this year, employment has plummeted by 6,000, to 64,000, and is expected to continue to fall.  The National Union of Dyers, Bleachers and Textile Workers, which has accepted the job cuts with relative docility, has predicted that the industry may disappear within two years unless it is nationalized.  Employers are scarcely less pessimistic. ''It's a back-to-the-wall situation,'' admitted Peter Richardson, of the Confederation of British Wool Textiles, an industry trade association. **********The recession could not have come at a worse time for Illingworth, which had embarked on a long-overdue reorganization following the deaths of Isidore (Mrs. Mason's father) and Maurice Ostrer. The brothers, who acquired a majority stake in the company during the 1940's, had spent their last years in the south of France. ''Isidore used to meet the board at Claridge's,'' recalled Peter Hardy, the company's joint chief executive for wool and worsted manufacturing. **********Directors remember that he used to instruct them to order the lamb cutlets at the London hotel's restaurant and to avoid white sugar. He also instructed them to buy companies, lots of them, and to finance them with short-term bank loans that now total some $56 million. **********With Mrs. Mason's go-ahead, Mr. Hardy and Donald Hanson, the joint chief executive for raw material-to-yarn production, are now whittling away at Illingworth's empire and its large debt. In the past 15 months, they have shut down five mills, trimmed operations in others and cut employment by 2,000 jobs, to 7,000. ''Our first priority is to get our house in order here,'' said Mr. Hardy. **********In the company's new Los Angeles office, meanwhile, the California branch of the board is laying the groundwork for expansion into the United States. ''Our long-range plans are mainly into America,'' said Mr. Yeardye during a visit to London last month. Although exports to the United States contributed a modest $3.5 million to Illingworth revenue last year, Mr. Yeardye said that ''we'd like it to account ultimately for half of our overseas sales.'' **********Already in the planning stages, according to management, is a United States factory that would weave cloth from Illingworth yarn. A men's wear manufacturer that would use imported Illingworth cloth is also contemplated. **********By setting up its own United States sales network - thus avoiding agents' commissions - and importing lower-duty yarn rather than cloth for use in its own United States factory, Mr. Yeardye maintained, Illingworth would be able to leap the tariff hurdle that has caused problems for its competitors. Nor would Illingworth's huge debt be an obstacle, according to Morgan Mason, who, after an extended absence from the board - ''He came to Shipley for a few days and then disappeared to Malibu for a year,'' grumbled a former Illingworth executive -has plunged full time into the company's United States affairs. **********''I'm up to my ears in banks and insurance companies to refinance Illingworth,'' he said in a telephone interview. He predicted that he could put together a consortium of 10 banks to furnish working capital as well as cash for takeovers. **********The company's other directors are less enthusiastic about United States expansion. ''There's no fundamental disagreement,'' insisted Mr. Hardy. ''It's just a question of timing.'' According to an industry analyst, however, the plans have produced ''a complete divergence on the board. Yeardye's off paddling his own canoe, while the other directors have to cope with the real problems,'' he said. **********Analysts are dubious about the odds for success in the United States. ''How can you sell to the U.S. with a 50 percent tariff anyway?'' asked Donald Anderson, of Vivian Gray, a London stock broker. ''They're concentrating on the U.S. because they live there.'' **********''A lot of U.K. weavers have burned their fingers in downstream activities, such as manufacturing garmets, to use up their cloth,'' observed Mr. Buck, of Laing & Cruickshank. ''If Illingworth textiles are not competitive, a U.S. company won't do them any good.'' **********But Mrs. Mason does not share such doubts. ''There is a market for British wool wherever there is money,'' she said.  Rival manufacturers also question the qualifications of Mr.  Yeardye, who oversaw Sassoon salons in the United States, and the young Mr. Mason, a graduate of Beverly Hills High School who was once the program coordinator of the ''Tonight Show.'' ''You can't suddenly jump into the textile business and make snap decisions,'' declared a top executive of a major British textile company. ''Those guys are acting like two kids in a candy shop.'' **********But Mrs. Mason is quick to back up her selection of Mr. Yeardye, noting that he had been in charge of selling Sassoon salon franchises around the world. ''Selling is selling,'' she said. **********Her son displays a similar confidence, asserting that he is no newcomer to the business. ''My father is from Huddersfield and my grandfather was a textile merchant,'' he said. ''My family is as well steeped in the industry as any in Britain.'' As American residents, he added, ''we probably know the U.S. market better than most British textile manufacturers.'' **********Thanks in part to its large payroll cuts and mill closures last year, Illingworth is expected to edge back into profit in 1981. But few analysts are optimistic about its long-term prospects. ''What Mrs. Mason wants to do could be good for the company, but she hasn't got the right men in Yeardye and Morgan,'' said the former Illingworth executive.

The I.C.C. ruling yesterday implements the Staggers deregulation act. **********The three railroads that met or exceeded the 11.7 percent return were the Fort Worth & Denver, a subsidiary of the Burlington Northern, and two lines owned by United States Steel, the Bessamer & Lake Erie and the Elgin, Joliet & Eastern. **********''The ruling is very important to the industry,'' said Richard E.  Briggs, executive vice president of the Association of American Railroads. ''Its full effect will not be realized for several years as we get into deregulating somewhat further, but it is a very sound beginning.'' The association is the chief trade group here for the nation's major railroads. Commission's Position **********''Railroads can obtain funds for investment only by offering rates of return comparable to other investment opportunities,'' the commission said in its ruling yesterday. ''Otherwise, investors will elect to invest their funds elsewhere. If railroads earn less than adequate rates of return because of inappropriate regulatory action, rather than because they are not providing a desired service, then the standards of the Rail Act and the clear thrust of Congressional policy will be thwarted.'' **********While praising the move of the commission as a step in the right direction, securities analysts were doubtful that the 11.7 percent return - if it was to be accomplished by railroads - would be adequate to make the companies comparable in financial performance to other industries. The acceptable rate of return, which will be recalculated yearly, may be higher in the future, they agreed. **********''The 11.7 percent does not match the current cost of capital, either debt or equity, but we are glad to see them moving in that direction,'' said Henry Livingston of Kidder, Peabody in New York City. Analyst Lauds Move **********Robert Long of First Boston, also in New York, said that the commission action was a ''positive event,'' but observed that most railroads ''are very far below the threshold that the agency has established.'' **********Mr. Long said that other future actions by the commission, such as decisions on new coal rates or exemptions of certain sectors of the railroad industry entirely from regulation, would be more important.  ''The exemption of piggyback traffic from regulations, done recently, was very important,'' he said. **********By comparison with the 11.7 percent rate of return that the commission found acceptable, some major roads, based on 1979 data, showed results as follows: Union Pacific, 7.4 percent; Southern System, 9.1; Seaboard Coast Line, 7.2; Chesapeake & Ohio, 4.6; Burlington Northern, 4.1, and Conrail, because it makes no profits, 0."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/03/world/algerian-envoys-return-to-teheran-with-new-us-offers-on-hostages.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1981-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1016, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALGERIAN ENVOYS RETURN TO TEHERAN WITH NEW U.S. OFFERS ON HOSTAGES", "print_headline": "ALGERIAN ENVOYS RETURN TO TEHERAN WITH NEW U.S. OFFERS ON HOSTAGES", "body_text": " **********The Algerian intermediaries returned here today with the latest United States proposals and terms for the release of the 52 American hostages. **********The three intermediaries - the Ambassador to Washington, Redha Malek; the Ambassador to Teheran, Abdelkarim Gheraieb, and the director of the Algerian Central Bank, Mohammed Seghier Mostefai - arrived at Mehrabad Airport by special plane this morning, after four days of talks in Washington. They were met at the airport by Ahmad Azizi, the Government's Director of Hostage Affairs. **********There was no official comment from the Iranians, although they were presumably given the United States position paper. Friday is the Moslem Sabbath and all Government offices were closed. **********The Algerian diplomats, who have maintained a steadfast public silence, retired to their rooms in the old Hilton Hotel in northern Teheran. General Agreement on Terms **********Iran and the United States have apparently reached general agreement on the terms for the release of the hostages but are bogged down in the mechanism for carrying them out. **********The key factors are money and the possession of the hostages - when the Iranians will receive the assets frozen by the United States, how much they can put their hands on immediately and when the hostages will be set free. **********The proposal brought here today is reported to have called for the deposit of $5 billion to $6 billion - the amount of Iranian assets relatively unencumbered by lawsuits in the United States - in the Algerian Central Bank. **********The Iranians are to take possession of the money when the hostages are released. The rest of the assets are to be released as claims against them are processed by an international arbitration panel. The value of the frozen assets has been estimated at up to $14 billion. **********The proposal also serves notice that an agreement must be reached within two weeks if the situation is to be resolved by the Carter Administration. **********Otherwise, the notice seems to imply, the administration of President-elect Ronald Reagan will begin with a clean slate. Although Mr. Reagan has refrained from involvement in the negotiations before he takes office, in recent days he has described the Iranian conditions as ''ransom'' demanded by ''barbarians,'' remarks that have caused considerable stir here. **********On Nov. 2 the Iranian Parliament laid down four conditions for the release of the hostages: a pledge by the United States not to interfere in Iran's internal affairs, the return of the assets that were frozen after the United States Embassy was seized in November 1979, the dropping of court suits by American companies and individuals and the return to Iran of the late Shah's wealth. Agreement on Most Demands **********The initial American response of last month, along with a later clarification, were released by the Iranians and then by the State Deptartment and indicated that the United States had agreed to all or most of the Iranian demands. **********The initial response and the clarification said the United States would formally promise not to interfere in Iranian affairs, to unfreeze the assets and revoke all economic and financial sanctions, to ''cancel and nullify'' legal claims and to freeze, help identify and assist in court cases aimed at recovering portions of the wealth of the late Shah and his family that were still in America. **********The Minister of State for Executive Affairs, Behzad Nabavi, one of the key Iranian officials involved in the negotiations, described the terms of the American response as ''generally acceptable.'' **********However, the Iranians, in their response to the United States on Dec. 21, put a $24 billion price tag on carrying out the conditions.  They demanded that the United States put that sum, which included $10 billion as a security for the recovery of portions of the Pahlevi family fortune, in the Central Bank of Algeria as a ''guarantee'' against the return of what they regarded as Iran's money. Deep Distrust for Great Satan **********The $24 billion plan seemed largely to be an expression of the deep distrust the revolutionaries feel for the United States, which they call the Great Satan. It was suggested, said the Speaker of Parliament, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, ''so you don't swindle us.'' **********American officials immediately said that the new proposal was impossible to carry out.  Then Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai summoned the heads of diplomatic missions to an extraordinary session last Saturday evening at which he made another proposal: the United States should return everything that could be documented as belonging to Iran, and the rest would be decided by binding arbitration. Meanwhile, the hostages would stay in Iran. **********Otherwise, Mr. Rajai said, after lengthy denunciations of the United States, ''the heroic nation is ready for martyrdom.'' Not much more has been heard of the Prime Minister's proposal, which carried no dollar figure but appeared to be an indication that Iran wnated to keep a flexible bargaining position. Latitude in Settling Mechanics **********Iranian officials have emphasized in the last few days that, within the context of the conditions set down by Parliament, Mr. Rajai, Mr.  Nabavi and the others are to have latitude in settling the mechanics of the agreement. **********The adherents of the Islamic Republican Party, who dominate Parliament and have effectively controlled the fate of the hostages all along, now appear eager for a settlement of the issue. **********Among the pressures mitigating for a settlement is the financial crunch caused by the border war with Iraq, the destruction of oilproducing facilities during the fighting, and the cumulative effect of the economic sanctions imposed after the seizure of the embassy. **********But the religious fundamentalists, having used the hostage issue as a weapon to undercut the liberals around President Abolhassan BaniSadr, risk being put in a difficult political position if, after morethan a year of flaming oratory, they are seen to be compromising with the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/12/business/sigmor-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SIGMOR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "SIGMOR CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/20/business/advertising-addendum.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 16, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ADDENDUM", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; ADDENDUM", "body_text": " *********** Museum magazine to add a New York edition, effective with the September/October issue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/10/business/amrep-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMREP CORP reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "print_headline": "AMREP CORP reports earnings for Qtr to July 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/11/business/general-magnaplate-corp-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GENERAL MAGNAPLATE CORP reports earnings for Yr to June 30", "print_headline": "GENERAL MAGNAPLATE CORP reports earnings for Yr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/02/business/slater-electric-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-aug-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SLATER ELECTRIC INC reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 31", "print_headline": "SLATER ELECTRIC INC reports earnings for Qtr to Aug 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/24/business/sec-is-busy-on-new-issues.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

''Japanese auto makers fully intend to hold car shipments to the level agreed.'' **********Japan, under strong pressure from the United States, decided May 1 to cut car shipments to America in the year ending next March 31 to 1.68 million units, down 7 percent from the 1.82 million units shipped last year. **********Toyota and Nissan also reported that domestic sales had dropped in May.  For Toyota, the largest car maker in Japan, the drop in all three categories - exports, domestic sales and production - was the first since January 1974. For Nissan, the second-biggest producer, whose vehicles sell under the Datsun brand, it was the first decline in all three figures since last February. **********Both companies, in separate statements, attributed the decline in part to export curbs worked out with the United States, Canada and West Germany. **********In the domestic market, the companies said sales were depreseed by an increase in Japanese commodity taxes that went into effect May 1.  Moreover, Mr. Mizuno noted, until recently wage increases in Japan had not kept pace with inflation, reducing disposable income and hurting car sales. **********While some recent wage gains have been more favorable, the effect on car sales will not develop until later this year, he predicted.  ''I think car sales in Japan will pick up in the second half,'' Mr.  Mizuno said. Declines of 3.5% and 11% **********Toyota's total vehicle exports to the United States in May came to 63,146 units, down 3.5 percent from May 1980. Exports of Toyota passenger cars fell 5.2 percent, to 50,093. **********At Nissan, shipments to the United States declined 11 percent, to 53,206 units. Passenger car shipments fell 11.1 percent, to 42,040.  Yet despite the decline in United States shipments by Toyota and san, Japan's Kyodo News Service quoted industry sources as saying that exports to the United States by the Japanese auto industry as a whole rose 3.9 percent in May from the year before, to 155,446.  Exports by such companies as the Honda Motor Company and Mitsubishi Motors rose, the Japanese news service said. **********Auto analysts speculated that it may have been more difficult for some of the smaller, fast-growing Japanese producers to restrain their exports than for their larger counterparts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/10/business/ashland-approved-on-integon-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ashland Approved On Integon Bid", "print_headline": "Ashland Approved On Integon Bid", "body_text": " **********Ashland Oil Inc. said the insurance commissioners of Georgia and Kansas had approved Ashland's plan to acquire the Integon Corporation in a two-phased transaction valued at about $252 million. **********An Ashland subsidiary will buy 2.84 million shares of Integon common at $40 a share in cash, as provided in its tender offer. **********It said the 2.84 million shares, or 45 percent of Integon, would be selected from the roughly 3.14 million shares tendered. **********In the second phase, Ashland will make a one for one exchange of a new series of cumulative convertible preferred stock for the remaining 55 percent of Integon. **********Ashland also announced that it had completed the purchase of an additional 1.7 million shares of the United States Filter Corporation at $33 each, giving it 60 percent of the company's voting stock."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/01/business/a-conglomorate-that-works.html": {"writer_name": "N.

It tells what it cares to about itself, and generally that is not much. It seems to discard more prevailing wisdom than it follows. Big as it is, it tends to keep its head low. And it is widely heralded as one of the best-managed companies in the world of business. **********Teledyne Inc. keeps rolling along, getting bigger, drawing more envy, attracting more mystery. It prospered mightily during the golden years for conglomerates in the 1960's, prospered when they subsequently fell from favor, and continues to prosper as they march back into the affections of investors. It is that rare conglomerate that has always worked. ''It's one of the almost unique companies in America,'' says Robert Christensen, a securities analyst at A.G.  Becker. ''It's a company that's a different beast than most.'' **********Broadly diversified, Teledyne is an amalgam of 130 companies (it doesn't like to call them subsidiaries) that make, among other things, engine tools, drones, Water Pik dental hygiene products, shower heads, swimming pool heaters, Acoustic Research stereo speakers, dental cements, the world's largest welding positioners and manipulators (capacities to 227 tons), bakery production lines and seismic systems to monitor earthquakes. It also owns several prominent insurance companies. The horde of properties can essentially be split up into five lines of business: industrial products, aviation and electronics, specialty metals, consumer products, and insurance and finance. **********Through its insurance arms, Teledyne has also poured money into a flock of companies - Litton Industries, Reichhold Chemicals, Walter Kidde -that are not brought into the family. On the whole, they have been propitious investments, the latest evidence being the agreement struck this week between Kennecott and Curtiss-Wright in their scrap for Curtiss-Wright shares. One upshot is that Teledyne's holdings in Curtiss-Wright will swell to a majority 57 percent, from 31.6 percent. **********To a large extent, Teledyne is the creation of one man. The man is Henry Singleton, an unorthodox and remarkable businessman who is high on almost everybody's list of the 10 most effective chief executives in the country. The holder of a doctorate in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (he favors being called Doctor), Teledyne's chairman founded the company in 1960, and, going his own idiosyncratic way, has fashioned it into a $3 billion corporate whale. While many other conglomerates have recently been selling off diseased acquisitions from the 60's, Teledyne eschews such activity and goes its smiling way. **********''It is, in my opinion, one of the best-managed companies in the country,'' says Robert Hanisee, an analyst at Amdec Securities, ''and Dr. Singleton is one of the best managers of assets there is.'' As one example of its stellar performance, Teledyne ranks 11th among the largest companies in its earnings-per-share growth rate between 1969 and 1979. **********Mr. Singleton runs the variegated world of Teledyne out of farfrom-ostentatious quarters high in a sleek Century City tower, symbolic of the lean operations that Teledyne prefers. These days, he rarely strays far afield. Company officers fly in to see him. He shuns presentations before Wall Street analysts. (''I have a job to do here, rather than running around touting the stock.'') The corporate communications staff rarely blows the publicity bugles very loudly, though, every so often, Mr. Singleton will consent to sit still for an interview in his office. **********The office affords a panoramic view of the Los Angeles Country Club. Near the window stands a low table supporting an exquisite chess set. An accomplished player in his own right, Mr. Singleton continues to follow developments in the chess scene, though he says he hasn't played the game much in the past 30 or 40 years. Teledyne has been his profession and avocation. **********Although many corporations readily spew forth long-range strategic plans, designed to fuel stupendous growth, Mr. Singleton professes to have no grand scheme for his empire. ''In the 60's, I was flying around trying to buy companies all the time,'' he says. ''In the 70's, we were trying to build up the companies and work on organization. The 80's? I don't know. I didn't know what I'd be doing in the 60's. Basically, it's the same thing. You just go to work and work the same.'' **********He continues, ''I don't think we can successfully lay out as a long-term strategy what we should be doing right now and for a month from now and for 10 years from now. If we could lay this out, we could just go on vacation for 10 years.'' **********To some extent, Mr. Singleton is being cute. He has now proven, better than anyone else, that the conglomerate concept can be made to work and thrive without having a feel for the future. ''You can't tell me that someone as smart as Henry Singleton doesn't have plans in mind,'' says an analyst who has long followed the company. ''He likes to tweak the nose of the outside world a little bit. The latest game that Henry is on is that he doesn't know what he's going to do.'' **********Though many corporate chieftains are lamenting the uncertainty of the time, Mr. Singleton doesn't view the environment as overly unpredictable. ''It's pretty uncertain all the time,'' he says.  ''People say it's more uncertain. You pick up Dickens's 'A Tale of Two Cities,' and it starts off, 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.' These are not the worst of times. I can remember a lot worse. I can remember the beginning of the 40's. I can remember all of the 30's. Those were worse times. Those were more uncertain times.'' **********In many respects, Mr. Singleton is akin to a corporate hoarder - gathering up a mishmash of properties, squirreling them away and never letting go. If one of his ''children'' misbehaves, he merely cracks the whip and brings it into line. With few exceptions, he has kept the companies he has acquired and held on to most of the investments he has orchestrated. **********A SK him why, and he responds, ''We're not in the cigarette business, but let's say we are. Say we just built another plant for cigarettes. Why should we sell it? We're selling a lot of cigarettes from the plant, why sell it? I have the same feeling about everything else, whether it's a cigarette business or oil or shares of Coke.'' **********Teledyne has attracted gales of attention for its large-scale investments, through its insurance companies. Whereas many other insurance companies pour their cash into a broad portfolio, Mr.  Singleton has opted to amass sizable holdings in a more select group. Teledyne holds 25 percent of Litton Industries, 57 percent of Curtiss-Wright (pending the Kennecott deal), 29 percent of Brockway Glass, 21 percent of Reichhold Chemicals, as well as large chunks of Walter Kidde, National Can, H.J. Heinz and International Harvester, among others. **********Though the performance of these investments has varied widely, they have, on the whole, done handsomely.  The Litton experience alone has been spectacular enough to wring emotion from the crustiest of investors. Teledyne bought its 9.6 million Litton shares at an average price of $14. Litton currently sells for about $75, a gain of more than $580 million in roughly five years. What does Mr. Singleton think of that? ''It's turned out just fine.'' One of the ironies of Henry Singleton is that he formerly worked at Litton, learned conglomeration at the feet of what was the concept's master, and learned to run a better conglomerate. When Litton came on hard times, its departed son returned to scoop up large blocks of Litton stock. **********Over the years, there has been conjecture that Mr. Singleton was aiming to add Litton and some of the others to the Teledyne stable, but he has always staunchly insisted that he had no such designs. And he has kept his word. He has also largely shied away from selling investments, even when the sweetest of offers present themselves.  ''All of these are thought of pretty much as permanent investments,'' Mr. Singleton explains. ''The idea of buying and selling investments is not very appealing to us. I'm not sure we'd be good at that.'' **********Also, to heck with meddling in the management of the companies in which he has sunk money, even though the size of his holdings affords him effective control in several of them. ''I don't get involved,'' he says. ''The phone is there, and anybody can call me.'' Do they?  ''It would be the exception if someone did.'' **********Although there have been undeniable disruptions in Teledyne's kingdom -some of them critical - Mr. Singleton does not publicly admit to disappointment in any acquisition. ''No,'' he says, ''the feeling of disappointment or happiness is not a very professional one. If one company needs attention, we just work on it.'' **********The Singleton way of working on a company can assume several forms. A major failing was Packard-Bell, which ran into serious problems in its television and stereo business some years ago. Mr.  Singleton plucked the company from those businesses. Another major crisis befell the Argonaut Insurance subsidiary in the mid-1970's.  The company, like some others, was hit with an avalanche of large malpractice settlements at a time when malpractice premiums were low, resulting in a major write-off in 1975. Teledyne management replaced most of Argonaut's senior officials, and essentially pulled out of the malpractice business. **********Last year, Teledyne's net earnings slipped to $343.8 million, from $371.9 million, on sales that edged up to $2.93 billion, from $2.71 billion. However, Mr. Singleton and company analysts ascribe the earnings drop strictly to the tough economy and not to any inherent problems at any of its sundry companies. **********Indeed, the performance of Teledyne has been daunting enough to almost trigger suspicion from interested observers on Wall Street.  ''I can't tell you for sure that it's not done by mirrors, the numbers are so good,'' says Robert Christensen. ''I can't be sure that something won't come unglued, but these numbers have been high for years. Some have accused Singleton of not spending enough on plant. I don't think that's true, but I can't swear he isn't milking something.'' **********I MMEDIATELY prior to beginning Teledyne, Mr.  Singleton worked for six years at Litton Industries, where he ascended to vice president and general manager. Along with George Kozmetsky, a Litton associate, Mr. Singleton left and with $225,000 each, they founded Teledyne. The enterprise grew by snapping up small and medium-sized companies, the bulk of them private, while leaving the management pretty much intact. Overall, Teledyne boasts an enviable record of management continuity. **********As distinct from the fashion of many conglomerates of merging companies in related businesses together, Teledyne fastidiously believes in keeping things small. What better way, it figures, to motivate company managers and to smoke out ills before they turn cancerous. **********For instance, Teledyne Systems, one of the electronics companies, had a department that made hybrid circuits for in-house consumption.  The department began to sell to outside purchasers and after sales got up to several million dollars a few years ago, Teledyne broke off the department into a separate company called Teledyne Microelectronics. **********As conglomerates go, Teledyne is relatively decentralized, affording its scattered companies considerable autonomy. ''Teledyne'' is a word culled from Greek origins that means ''force applied at a distance.'' **********''We simply function here as personnel directors and reviewers of the activities,'' Mr. Singleton says. When it comes to tracking the financial health of its widespread companies, however, Teledyne is a watchful parent indeed. Voluminous reports flow into the Century City offices, where they get scrutinized by Mr. Singleton and George Roberts, Teledyne's president. **********Day-to-day operations are largely the province of Mr. Roberts, though there is no clear split of duties between him and Mr.  Singleton. ''As far as I'm concerned, he can do anything he wishes, and I always know what that is,'' Mr. Singleton says. ''I'm free to do anything I want, and he's not going to get on me. He's free to do anything he pleases, and I won't get on him.'' **********After buying up companies during the 1960's, Teledyne has become an unusually passive consumer. It has not bought a company since 1969.  In large part, Mr. Singleton has been abashed at the gigantic prices that companies are fetching. ''We have a fine group of companies and our attention is on them,'' he says. ''I believe we can do a better job for our shareholders investing the money rather than buying up companies.'' **********''He'd rather buy 25 percent of a company real cheap than get into a bidding war,'' says Robert Hanisee.  Close followers of Teledyne, however, anticipate that the aggressive conglomerate will be shopping again in not too many years. Teledyne generates a tremendous cash flow, on the order of $150 million to $200 million a year, and it needs to find a home for that money. In the past decade, it has used the cash to buy back large blocks of its stock and to invest money in the insurance subsidiaries. **********For many years, Teledyne has been viewed as a vastly undervalued stock. Like its conglomerate kin, it fell out of fashion. But of late, conglomerates have come part of the way back into vogue, though securities analysts still regard Teledyne stock, which closed Friday at 190 1/4, as a good buy. **********As it happens, the stock is one of the most expensive issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Though it currently hovers around $200 a share, it sold for $60 in late 1976 and about $8 in late 1974. Some analysts are predicting a rise to above $300 within a few years. **********Some corporate chieftains might split the stock when the price gets that high in order to bring it within reach of a broader array of investors, but not Mr. Singleton. ''I don't really think much about that,'' he says. ''The company is traded on the stock exchange, and if people want to buy it they can.'' **********Another quirk of Mr. Singleton's is his adamant refusal to pay a cash dividend. Asked about this, he retorts, ''Well, I feel the shareholders don't want a cash dividend. If they wanted one, they wouldn't buy the stock, because they know we don't pay one.'' Pressed for further elaboration, he adds, ''If you have to borrow the money for a cash dividend, I don't know why you would want to do it. It is the practice of American industry to borrow money to pay the cash dividend.'' They say, 'Oh, no, we're paying it out of profits.' Well, then they're borrowing for something else. Be-cause there is debt. So you're asking the wrong person. You should ask the others why they're paying the cash dividend.'' **********Mr. Singleton does, however, pay a stock dividend. ''Many years ago we started doing that for many of the same reasons that people started paying cash dividends,'' he says. ''It was the fashion, and some of the shareholders like it. I don't think it has much effect one way or the other. It's a noneconomic event.'' **********Though he is now 64, Mr. Singleton claims that retirement is not in his thoughts. Nor does he admit to fears of a Teledyne minus a Singleton. He maintains that George Roberts ''could run this company as well as I can.'' **********Can the company continue its staggering growth? ''I think we can,'' Mr. Singleton says without pause. ''I just don't know how to do it.  That's why you just go to work every day. We can do the best job we can by being diligent every day.''

It was a record yield for a new Treasury issue of that maturity, exceeding the previous high of 15.81 percent for notes sold May 5. **********Many economists who have been predicting a sustained drop in interest rates since May are dismayed by yields that are at record high levels for maturities longer than a year. So far, investors have not shown much confidence that the slowdown of inflation will continue over the life of their investments and are quite willing to keep their funds invested in the money markets, where yields are well over 17 percent for nearly risk-free securities due in a month. **********''Bullishness toward fixed-income securities has not been squelched by any means,'' commented Alan Lerner, senior vice president at the Bankers Trust Company, ''but there is considerably more indecision today.'' He pointed out that the Treasury expects to raise more than $30 billion of new cash in the fourth quarter, which could put upward pressure on rates. **********Although analysts agreed that investor demand for notes and bonds was weak, many said that the weakness tended to be overstated in the days before large Treasury financings as dealers try to cut prices and raise yields to levels that will make it easier to sell the new securities. More Financing Imminent **********The $4.25 billion note sale was the first of three note and bond auctions this week and will be followed by sales of $2.25 billion of 10-year notes today and $2 billion of 13 7/8 percent bonds tomorrow.  In advance of those auctions, the 14 1/2 percent notes due in 9 3/4 years were offered at 97 30/32, to yield 14.89 percent, up 1/8 on the day, and the 13 7/8 percent bonds due 2011 were offered at 98 6/32, to yield 14.12 percent, up slightly more than 1/2. **********In the tax-exempt market, many state and local governments, like corporations, have been relying on short-term debt while they defer long-term bond financings until interest rates are lower. For some, it has been a costly lesson in the perils of trying to predict interest rates. **********Philadelphia, for example, rejected bond underwriters' proposals last March because the net interest cost of 13.21 percent was unacceptably high. Since then, interest rates have moved sharply higher and yesterday the city sold $60.5 million of bonds at a 13.9 percent net interest cost. **********Underwriters led by Citibank said that all but $2.7 million of the issue was sold from the syndicate account by late in the day, though a significant number of bonds were still in dealer hands. Yields for the serial bonds ranged from 10 percent in 1982 to 12.4 percent in 1991, while 13 percent term bonds due 1996 were offered at par, as were $43 million of 13 1/2 percent term bonds due 2006. **********Despite the Philadelphia experience, many local government borrowers continue to develop sources of credit that would suplement the long-term bond market. Connecticut recently announced plans to sell $150 million of notes due April 15, 1982, with most of the proceeds earmarked for repayment of previously issued temporary notes that fall due on Sept. 1. The offering circular for the notes said that the state plans to begin sales of tax-exempt commercial paper in September, which would make it the first state to make use of that increasingly popular financing device. Cheaper Source of Funds **********Underwriters say that several other states, as well as the Municipal Assistance Corporation of New York are considering issuing tax-exempt commercial paper because it adds financial flexibility and can be a cheaper source of funds.

This was clearly implied by figures released yesterday by the New York Stock Exchange. The figures disclosed that margin debt in accounts with less than 40 percent equity jumped to 38 percent of the total at the end of August, up from 25 percent in July. **********Margin accounts with less than 40 percent equity are regarded as vulnerable because most brokerage firms send out margin calls when accounts fall below 30 percent. Some firms call for more capital when accounts drop to 35 percent. **********Not since March 1980 has so much of the margin debt been concentrated in accounts with less than 40 percent equity. It was perhaps understandable, then, that the market plunged in April 1980 as investors reacted to word that the capital of a few major brokerage firms could be in jeopardy as a result of alliances with the Hunt brothers of Texas, who had experienced heavy losses in the silver market. The market's downswing that April was pushed still lower when shares were ordered sold as thousands of investors failed to meet margin calls. **********Last month, as share prices plummeted, total margin debt dropped by $600 million, reducing the total to $14.3 billion. That decline was the largest since April 1980, in the wake of the silver crisis. **********Since the end of last month, the market as measured by the Dow Jones industrials has dropped another 4 1/2 percent. That includes yesterday's drop by the Dow of 6.75, to 851.60 - a fraction of a point above the 15-month low. **********Margin calls were clearly a factor in the August decline and brokerage houses have taken to monitoring accounts closely so that calls can go out promptly in the event of a drop below the required level of equity in the weeks ahead. **********There are factors at work in margin accounts that can bring an early call. Many brokerage houses in calculating the value of customer portfolios for purposes of determining whether to call for additional funds do not recognize as eligible for margin purchases shares selling for less than $5. Many firms also require maintenance of 50 percent equity in shares selling at between $5 and $10 each.  The extended bear market has caused shares of some companies that once sold in the high teens to drop below the $10 level. **********In any case, margin calls go out sooner than many inexperienced investors expect. Assume a customer's equity is at 40 percent and the total value of the customer's holdings are $10,000. The equity then is $4,000. A decline in the shar es averaging 10 percent (less than that if the v alue of some shares dropped below $10, of course) reduces the c ustomer's equity to $3,000, or just over 30 percent of the new $9,00 0 value of the holding. **********As the customer's equity declined, he would receive a call even at the more liberal brokerage house to increase the percentage of his equity and decrease the amount of his margin - the money borrowed to buy the stock holding. (Stock exchange rules require that a customer have at least 25 percent equity.) **********In an era of unusually high interest rates, the customer might think twice about answering the call with more cash. Brokers are charging most margin customers at least 20 percent interest and some are subject to even higher charges. **********The customer with the $10,000 account on 40 percent margin would have a loan of 60 percent of that sum, or $6,000. Assume that he paid interest on the account at a rate of 20 percent a year. That would amount to $1,200 a year, or $100 a month. **********Once the values in the account dropped by $1,000, the customer would have to produce several hundred dollars to meet the broker's margin call, without a reduction in the monthly interest expense.  Obviously, many hard-pressed investors cannot afford to hold their positions and others are so discouraged that they no longer want to. **********The price of failing to meet a call is considerable. The account in the example is now worth $9,000 and the customer still owes $6,000.  Liquidation would leave him less than the $3,000 selling price because of the deductions for margin interest and brokerage commissions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/25/business/rowan-companies-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-mar-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ROWAN COMPANIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "print_headline": "ROWAN COMPANIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Mar 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/05/business/ramada-inns-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-apr-2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RAMADA INNS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Apr 2", "print_headline": "RAMADA INNS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Apr 2", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/18/business/finance-briefs-009528.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Scientific Leasing Inc. announced an intial public offering of 750,000 shares of its common stock at $6 a share through a John Muir group. *********** Thoratec Laboratories Corporation registered an initial offering with the Securities amd Exchang Commission of 625,000 common shares, through a First Albany group. *********** Citicorp sold $150 milliion of 91-day commercial paper at an average rate of 16.495 percent, down from 16.583 percent at last week's sale."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/29/world/mrs-thatcher-back-to-rising-criticism.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 953, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MRS.

THATCHER BACK, TO RISING CRITICISM", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has returned to Britain from the conference of rich and poor nations in Mexico to find the dissatisfaction with her economic program stronger than ever. **********Mrs. Thatcher had hoped to calm the dissidents within her party at the Conservatives' annual conference in Blackpool this month, and she won a standing ovation from the grass-roots activists on the conference floor. But she failed completely to calm the anxieties of Tory backbenchers and Cabinet members who see their political futures jeopardized by the rigor of the Prime Minister's doctrine. **********Today, the House of Commons debated a no-confidence motion introduced by Michael Foot, leader of the opposition Labor Party.  ''Many on the Government side are becoming increasingly alarmed at the course on which they have embarked,'' said Mr. Foot. ''They would like to see a change and a very drastic change - they have spoken out against the theoretical basis of monetarism and said they wish to place a greater emphasis on dealing with unemployment. Much of what they said is right.'' To no one's surprise Mrs. Thatcher restated her faith in her monetarist policies, and to no one's surprise she won a vote of confidence, but the victory will still leave vital problems unsolved.'' **********The fears of the dissidents, or ''wets'' - ''wet'' is an undergraduate slang word in Britain meaning weak-willed -were heightened by the Tories' bad showing in the Croydon North West byelection Thursday, when the Liberal-Social Democratic alliance won the seat. Those fears were redoubled this weekend when a publicopinion poll showed that Shirley Williams of the Social Democrats was likely to win the next by-election, at Crosby in the Liverpool area, overturning a Tory margin of nearly 20,000 votes. Change of Course Predicted **********Speaking on television Sunday, Sir Ian Gilmour, a leading ''wet'' who was ousted from the Cabinet some weeks ago, argued that widespread unhappiness among Conservative M.P.'s and Conservative voters, as manifest at Croydon, would soon force the Prime Minister to change course. He said that ''the strategy is falling apart,'' and added that ''Mrs. Thatcher can see the writing on the wall as quickly as anyone else and does not want to go down in disastrous defeat.'' **********''It is quite impossible for Mrs. Thatcher to ignore that very heavy weight of opinion,'' Sir Ian declared. ''It is there. She cannot wish it away. She cannot reshuffle her Cabinet all the time, presumably to get 21 people all of whom agree with her. It is simply not practicable to do so.'' **********The Cabinet is Mrs. Thatcher's most pressing current problem. At an unusually difficult meeting last week, it was unable to reach agreement on the Treasury's proposals for cuts in public spending of almost $10 billion. The Prime Minister strongly supported the proposals, a key element in her anti-inflationary strategy, but she was able to command the backing of only seven other ministers of the 21 present at the session. **********It seems evident that Mrs. Thatcher's most recent Cabinet reorganization, which was designed to reward her friends and punish her critics, has failed to achieve its goals. Sir Ian asserted, and several current Cabinet members privately agreed, that the Prime Minister no longer commands a Cabinet majority for her overall economic plan, which is called the medium-term financial strategy. **********Even John Biffen, one of the most vehement monetarists at the beginning of Mrs. Thatcher's term two and a half years ago, has in the last two weeks begun saying semipublicly that her strategy is impossible to sustain politically, and he opposed the cuts in the Cabinet discussions last week. Cabinet Gets a Warning **********Sir Geoffrey Howe, the embattled Chancellor of the Exchequer, remains a loyal supporter of the Prime Minister. He has warned the Cabinet that he will not increase public borrowing to make up for any failure to cut spending, because that would increase inflation.  His only alternative, he reportedly said, would be to increase levies such as sales and excise taxes. **********In contrast to the previous pattern, Sir Geoffrey's threat appeared to have little impact on the ministers opposed to more cuts. One said over the weekend that higher taxes were ''better political symbols than spending cuts'' at a time of record unemployment. **********The argument will resume tomorrow at another Cabinet meeting. Since last week, Leon Brittan, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has been attempting to sell its ideas to the rebellious ministers in ''spending'' departments, with a conspicuous lack of success so far. **********Some Conservatives believe that there are already enough dissident backbenchers prepared to vote against another deflationary budget to prevent Mrs. Thatcher from getting it through the House of Commons, even if she could somehow win in the Cabinet. If she becomes convinced that they are right, the Prime Minister might relent from her insistence on a rigid link between revenue and spending; a defeat on a budget bill would be a crippling humiliation, even if it did not precipitate a general election that she would almost certainly lose. **********A clue to the trend in the Government's thinking may have been provided last weekend in a speech by Francis Pym, the leader of the House of Commons. Mr. Pym is considered a likely future party leader by his peers, and he has been reluctant to become publicly identified with the ''wet'' point of view. **********Speaking to a group of Young Conservatives in Suffolk, he said of the nation and the Conservative party: ''We abhor extremes, or anything near them; we prefer compromise and agreement to confrontation and disharmony.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/21/world/walesa-appeals-to-the-west-for-food-aid.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1981-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 609, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WALESA APPEALS TO THE WEST FOR FOOD AID", "print_headline": "WALESA APPEALS TO THE WEST FOR FOOD AID", "body_text": " **********Lech Walesa, Solidarity's leader, addressed an unusual appeal to ''the working people and trade unions of Western Europe'' today, asking them to pressure their governments to provide food aid to get Poland through a difficult winter. **********The nation's economic situation was so alarming, he said, that it could lead to ''spontaneous outbursts of public discontent'' in the coming months that ''would have disastrous economic and political consequences.'' **********If Western trade unions were to persuade their governments to provide emergency food aid, he said, then the Solidarity union would ''insure public control of the distribution'' and also the fastest possible repayment.

Strikers Are Ignored **********That the army units directed most of their attention toward the local administration, and not to the strikers, was implicit in remarks today by a Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Stanislaw Masztanowicz. He said that local administrators had been made aware of their own ''shortcomings'' and that the military group leaders had collected information for the Supreme Control Chamber, the state body that investigates official corruption. **********A Solidarity bulletin from Katowice noted a few days ago that ''party propaganda'' had originally depicted the army units' role as ''suppressing hotbeds of tension'' and ''neutralizing'' anti-Communist forces. **********''Everyone has been pleasantly surprised that the operational groups are not pulling pigs out of pigsties,'' the Solidarity publication said, ''but are driving the corrupt local government apparatus to work. It has turned out that indeed the army is looking for antisocialist elements and is finding them in local governments, in rural retailing cooperatives and also, which no one had anticipated, in local party committees.'' **********''Carry on, general,'' the bulletin urged, ''but with greater courage.'' Gasoline Prices to Rise **********In an attempt to cut down lengthy gasoline lines, the Government announced an increase of up to 50 percent in the price of high-octane gasoline. It will take effect Sunday. **********In another development, a Deputy Prime Minister, Mieczyslaw Rakowski, told representatives of officially sponsored trade unions that the Government would appoint a group within the next few days to set up a front of national accord, an overall coalition that would presumably include Solidarity, the Communist Party and the Roman Catholic Church.

The purpose, according to Enrique V. Iglesias, the secretary general of the conference, is to create a worldwide climate of opinion that will pave the way for accelerated development of alternatives to fossil fuels. **********In a recent interview, Mr. Iglesias, a Uruguayan, said it was important for the world to begin ''to move away from oil to a new energy mix.'' **********The Nairobi conference will examine ways to broaden the use of power from the wind, the oceans and water in other forms, the sun, geothermal sources, draft animals and firewood, which all provide fuels that tend to be environmentally benign. Focus on Developing Nations **********Mr. Iglesias said that the conference would concentrate on the needs of the developing countries. He noted that more than two billion people now depend on rapidly diminishing supplies of firewood as their major source of energy. **********However, a recent gathering of experts known as the North-South Roundtable, meeting to prepare for the Nairobi conference, concluded that the increased use of renewable energy might be more critical in industrialized nations than in the poor countries. **********Maurice F. Strong, the Canadian chairman of the International Energy Development Corporation, a private company concerned with energy resources in developing countries, conducted the roundtable meeting in Rome. He said at a recent news conference that the industrialized nations could certainly afford the investments in research and development of new energy sources, which could then be shared with the poorer nations. **********A State Department paper on the conference said that the goals of the United States for the meeting included accelerating ''the development, acceptance and use of new and renewable sources of energy, taking into account the effects on the global environment and resource base.'' Elimination of Support **********In its domestic program, however, the Reagan Administration is trying to eliminate or cut back Government support of most programs to develop renewable fuel sources and other alternatives to oil and coal consumption. **********This year the Department of Energy prepared legislation to eliminate many of these subsidized programs and the Office of Management and Budget has been seeking to cut the money available for such projects. **********In its recent budget vote, the House of Representatives retained some funds to encourage the commericial development of solar energy and other alternate programs. But the Administration seems determined to leave such efforts largely to the private sector. **********A study conducted for the Carter Administration's Energy Department by the Solar Energy Research Institute, a Federal agency, concluded that heavy investment to promote renewable sources and energy efficiency could virtually eliminate this nation's need to import oil by the end of the century. Director Asked to Resign **********In late June, the director of the institute, Denis A. Hayes, was asked by the Energy Department to resign. He charged that the Administration, specifically Energy Secretary James B. Edwards, was seeking to paralyze solar energy development to concentrate on nuclear power. **********No one could be reached at the Energy Department who would respond to questions about the Administration's position on renewable energy resources. **********However, James Stromayer, the United States coordinator for the Nairobi conference, said, ''The new Administration feels it is sound economics to put all forms of energy on an equal footing in the marketplace.'' **********Mr. Stromayer added that the Reagan Administration had not embarked on ''a total abandonment of research and development in new and renewable sources of energy.'' The Government's role, he said, was to investigate long-term applications of new energy sources while commercial interests developed such sources in response to market conditions. Essential to Remove 'Burdens' **********''This Administration is not saying by its policy that we don't think renewable energy sources are good,'' Mr. Stromayer said. ''What our policy is saying is that it is essential to remove regulatory and bureaucratic burdens from the economy. Lifting that burden should release the creative forces of the private market.'' **********But Mr. Iglesias said ''it would be a pity for the United States not to continue to develop technology'' for new and renewable energy sources. ''It is not only in your interests but the interests of the rest of the world,'' he said. **********Mr. Iglesias said that the attitude of the United States toward renewable energy ''is not the mood you perceive in Western Europe.'' ''All the Western European countries are working hard on this,'' he said. ''So is Japan.'' Mr. Iglesias emphasized that the conference was not an attempt to turn the developing countries to alternative sources of energy so that the remaining oil reserves would be available to the industrialized countries. He said that the poor countries would continue to require oil and coal. **********But he said he was optimistic that alternate fuels could supply some 20 percent of the world's needs by 2000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/11/world/around-the-world-drive-to-oust-bazargan-said-to-expand-in-iran.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 172, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Drive to Oust Bazargan Said to Expand in Iran", "print_headline": "Around the World; Drive to Oust Bazargan Said to Expand in Iran", "body_text": " **********A drive by Islamic hard-liners to oust former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan from Parliament includes a petition drive for the ouster for Mr. Barzargan's parliamentary supporters, a former Bazargan aide said today. **********Ahmad Sadr Haj Seyyed Javadi, who was Interior Minister under Mr.  Bazargan, said in a telephone interview that the petition by supporters of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini appeared to be part of a campaign to have the Parliament, vote to expel Mr. Bazargan and eight others, including himself.

Although McDonald's is expected by forecasters to earn $6.60 a share in 1981 - which would be a sparkling 20 percent gain over last year's $5.49 a share - that growth rate looks like a peak to some analysts and is decidedly below historic rates. **********Skeptics argue that a major factor in the company's recent success has been the depressed condition of the beef market over the last two and a half years. Wholesale utility cattle prices, which peaked at 57 cents a pound in the spring of 1979, touched 42 cents a pound earlier this year, just above the low of 39 cents a pound set at the end of 1978. The most recent available figures showed 44 cents a pound. **********While beef prices have fallen, menu prices have remained firm. As a result, McDonald's and other leading fast-food companies have experienced improved margins but with smaller increases in traffic.  Specifically, the sales of McDonald's were up about 14 1/2 percent in the first half of 1981, while earnings were up 22 percent. **********The question is, will McDonald's grow enough in the years ahead to justify investment by those seeking high future growth?  Michael Culp, who follows McDonald's for E.F. Hutton & Company, thinks not. He comments: ''McDonald's growth in recent years has come almost exclusively from the opening of new stores and the raising of menu prices. If you adjust the figures to reflect changing economic environments, you discover that the customer base has been flat for five to 10 years. It stands to reason that growth over the next five years for a company with 6,000 outlets here and abroad should be much closer to 15 percent than 20 percent.'' **********Mr. Culp expects that reduced rate of growth as a result of a 7 percent addition to the store base annually and 8 percent higher menu prices. He explained that, when inflation is high - as it has been - McDonald's ''needs to and can get 10 percent price increases annually.'' But in a period of declining inflation, which he expects will occur well into the decade, he believes that price increases will have to be lower - especially since new competitive factors loom. **********In a recent report by Mr. Culp recommending Denny's Inc., a coffee shop chain, he argued that McDonald's, Burger King and other limitedmenu chains had broadened their menus in recent years, thereby compromising the two areas critical to their success: low prices and fast service. ''In so doing, they have made themselves vulnerable to intense competition from the coffee shops because the price differential has been narrowed but the quality differential has not,'' he said. **********Coincident with a reduced rate of growth is McDonald's rapidly rising dividend. McDonald's formerly paid out 5 to 10 percent of earnings, using most of its cash to finance new stores. Now much of McDonald's excess cash is being used to retire debt since less is needed to finance new stores. **********Mr. Culp couples a 15 percent growth rate with the company's 1 to 2 percent dividend yield for a total return of 16 or 17 percent. This assumes no improvement in the price-earnings multiple, currently 8 1/2 times the $7.75 a share he estimates for 1982. **********By contrast, the 1,000 companies that E.F. Hutton follows show an average earnings growth of 14 percent and a yield of 5 percent for a total average return of 19 percent. On average, these stocks sell at a price-earnings multiple of 7, Mr. Culp said. ''Thus, McDonald's has a below-average total return and an above-average price-earnings multiple,'' he added. **********Needless to say, he is not recommending the shares, though he believes they are worth 70 as compared with the current price of 64.  William Trainer of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith believes McDonald's growth rate over the next five years will be 17 percent.  But he draws a different conclusion: This rate of growth makes the company's shares highly attractive. Mr. Trainer concedes that past tactics of opening more and more units will be tempered by the company's already impressive size. **********But there are favorable implications to slower growth: Internal cash flow will exceed capital expenditures for the first time in 1981 and continue to do so by ever wider margins, he said. In 1980, cash flow was 92 percent of capital expenditures. He noted that balance sheet leverage was declining. In the first six months of 1981, the company retired $87 million in long-term debt, ''mostly prime-related,'' to reduce the total to $883 million on June 30. **********Mr. Trainer said that McDonald's ''has a consistency that is extremely hard to find; it is one of the few companies among the socalled 'nifty fifty' of the late 1960's that hasn't stubbed its toe; I am an aggressive buyer of the shares.'' **********Robert Emerson, who follows McDonald's for Fred Alger & Company and looks for even higher growth than Mr. Trainer, said: ''The problem Wall Street has had with McDonald's is the slowing growth rate. In the mid-1970's, growth was about 30 percent, and it gradually slowed to the 16 percent area in the late 1970's. But this year the growth is accelerating to about 20 percent, and the rate could be 21 to 22 percent next year.'' **********He added that the key to McDonald's success now is that McDonald's is so profitable and is such a cash generator it can open 500 stores and increase market share even as it pays off debt."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/14/business/patents-avoiding-closed-eyes-as-photos-are-taken.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy jo", "pub_date": "1981-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 184, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Avoiding Closed Eyes As Photos Are Taken", "print_headline": "Patents; Avoiding Closed Eyes As Photos Are Taken", "body_text": " **********An engineer for the Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, has found a way to avoid poor photographs of people who shut their eyes.

Many are already buying.  ''We think we're near the bottom in both the stock and bond markets,'' said Donald R. Kurtz, executive vice president for securities investments for the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States. Despite having lost money so far in 1981 for Equitable's pension fund accounts, ''we're becoming fairly fully invested,'' he added. **********The profess ionals, as they are known on Wall Street, did not panic during August and the first half of September, when the market suffered its worst drubbing of the year. Few have reduced their stockholdings belo w 50 percent of the total assets under their aegis.

At the end of last year, for instance, 65 percent of pension fund assets were invested in stocks, with 35 percent in bonds, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 'Not Until 1982' **********''Nobody is going to make money in the stock market until 1982,'' Mr. Kurtz said. The market's latest tumble is only another dip along a long road they are traveling, most of the money managers said confindently. **********''We're not short-term players, we're in the market for the long run,'' asserted William Iglehart, vice president for common stocks at the Aetna Life and Casualty Company. **********In interviews, some managers of the larger institutional investors were quick to dismiss the much-vented worry about a deepening Federal deficit, arguing instead that the Administration's economic program was likely to soften the pace of inflation and spur the economy if the Federal Reserve Board did not weaken its steady grip on the nation's money supply. Scope of Their Holdings **********Money managers have notable influence on movements in stock prices. Institutions managed stocks valued at $519.9 billion at the end of 1980, or roughly a third of the total value of common stocks of American companies, according to the S.E.C. (The total value was $1.600 billion.) **********Foreigners held stocks valued at $114.5 billion, with other domestic stock investors, primarily individuals, owning shares worth $938.9 billion. On the New York Stock Exchange, institutions owned $440 billion at the end of last year, or 35.4 percent of the total value of $1,200 billion for all common stocks listed on the exchange, according to the exchange. **********Many of the professionals already have begun to place their bets on specific stocks and industries that they believe are likely to outperform the broader market in the coming months. They point out, however, that bonds appear to be a better buy for making money quickly. Some of the Favorites **********Dave H. Williams, chairman of Alliance Capital, which shepherds more than $10 billion in pension funds, is favoring stocks that will benefit from increased consumer spending. Recent Alliance purchases included Walmart, General Motors, Cox Broadcasting and Delta Air Lines. Stocks in favor are among other fund managers include MCA, Coca-Cola and General Electric, plus utilities like Commonwealth Edison, Consolidated Edison, Houston Natural Gas and Florida Power and Light. **********''We think we're in for a long period of declining interest rates,'' Mr. Williams said. ''We're very light on energy stocks, but are fairly heavily invested in specialty retailers and consumer goods manufacturers.'' Alliance also is accumulating bonds with eight- to 10-year maturities, he said. **********Eliot Williams, president of the Travelers Investment Management Company, a unit of the Travelers Insurance Company, said ten-year bonds, with yields of 15 percent or more, were paying so much that only further, sharp rises in interest rates could render them poor investments. Travelers has extended its retreat from stocks, and is buying bonds. Attractiveness of Bonds **********''Looking out over the next six to twelve months, bonds are at least as attractive as stocks,'' acknowledged Robert G. Wade Jr., president of the Bank of American Investment Management Corporation.  ''But stocks selected now should do extremely well over the next two to three years.'' **********Mr. Iglehart of Aetna says that buying bank, insurance and other financial service companies should be profitable in 1982 if the surprisingly protracted run of high interest rates abates. ''But we would change our strategy in a lot of ways if the Federal Reserve eases its monetary policy,'' he cautioned. ''That would put us back into the inflation kick, making the energy area and other inflation hedges much more attractive.'' **********Many of the managers said, however, that they believed the Fed would continue its tight grip on the growth of the money supply. They acknowledged that the monetary policy was already squeezing the availability of credit within the economy and that a stiff recession might be unfolding. ''That is w hy the market has been scared,'' said Dave Williams of Alliance Capi tal. Mr. Iglehart deflected the notion that the anticipated g rowth of the Federal deficit, causing the Government to borrow more a nd keep interest rates high, would be the main cause of a recession.  ''The issue of the deficit is irrelevant compared to theimportance of monetary policy ,'' Mr. Iglehart said. **********A recession would depress corporate earnings in what a few months ago was expected to be a strong economy in 1982.

Wald. I was drawn to read the article because of the word Amway. I am one of the 750,000 Amway distributors that Mr.  Wald wrote about. **********Mr. Wald evidently believes that with his various jibes and journalistic innuendoes, he has belittled these distributors.  Speaking for myself, I found the reverse to be true. Some very positive aspects were evident for the discerning reader: *********** ''The Amway totals are staggering; founded in 1959, the privately held company reported sales of $1.1 billion in the 12 months ending Aug. 31, 1980 ...'' *********** The Federal Trade Commission investigation begun in 1975 found ''the bulk of its operation was judged legal.'' (Actually, Amway won.) *********** ''For those with faith, it seemed, all things are possible.'' *********** Janice Santovasi, of Vernon, Conn., describing dropping out of Amway, is quoted: ''I guess I didn't believe in it enough myself. I couldn't get up there and explain it to them, and get very enthusiastic.'' **********I think the article was slanted to show Mr. Wald's clever turn of phrase, rather than to inform his readers in a straightforward manner of his encounter with one Amway distributor. It is easy to spice up a story. I could do so rather easily by questioning his expectations when he implies that he was lured to a strange woman's apartment. **********I would like to address Mr. Wald's astonishment at the failure of the Amway distributor to disclose her profits. I challenge him to contact 20 or so people in business or otherwise and see how many disclose their income. The corner delicatessen man, his most respected Congressman (who is bound by law to full disclosure), the fellow pounding out a story in another office of The Times, is hard pressed to be completely honest in this regard. Mr. Wald might even try asking his mother-in-law or his best friend, and I will wager he would not be able to separate fact from fiction. **********Mr. Wald contacted the Amway Corporation to ascertain the volume of the average distributor. He was told the average doesn't mean a lot, but he evidently disputed this fact. In order to bring this idea into focus for him, I would suggest that he research the average income of writers. Or actors. Does that discourage the thousands of college students studying journalism today? Does that account for the long waiting lists to enroll in the prestigious drama schools? **********Mr. Wald questioned the ''retention rate'' or survival rate of Amway distributors. I suggest he question the turnover rate of any business or industry he chooses. Start with The New York Times. Then General Motors. How many times do you get waited on by the same clerk in your local ''7-11'' or Waldbaum's? All this research might be enlightening. **********I could continue discussing each and every point of the article.  Instead, I would just like to put on record that Mr. Wald is only one person with one opinion. He saw only one distributor's effort to take a shot at improving her financial status. I applaud anyone who tries to better him or herself, and I deplore the negative media who make their living dredging up the worst in any given situation and relishing every opportunity to do so. **********You, Mr. Wald, take your way! I will stick with Amway.  RITA C.

Wooden poles prop up shaky walls, patched roofs continue to leak and sewer breaks send rivulets down the steep streets where children play. **********''We'd like to get out, but there's no place to go,'' Mohammed Makhloufi, a cinema operator, told a visitor at his home. ''We got scared when the house next door fell down recently and cracks began to appear in our walls.'' **********One of the fine old mansions of the Casbah, the Makhloufi house, with its tiled, Moorish-style balconies and arches, marble stairs and fountain, was built for one family. Today there are 14 families living in the 14-room house, each family with seven to ten people in a room. There is no kitchen or bathroom to speak of, only three Turkish toilets, but the house is scrupulously clean. Too Many People **********The main problem of the Casbah, in fact of Algiers as a whole, is overcrowding. In precolonial times, prior to 1830, the Casbah was the city of Algiers, with a population of 30,000. Then came the French colonial settlement, the general rush to the cities and a high population growth rate in Algeria of 3.2 percent. Today, between 80,000 and 100,000 people live in the 110-acre Casbah. They represent only a small part of the Algerian capital, which has a population of more than two million. **********An international effort to rehabilitate the Casbah is under way.  ''We must displace one-half of the population of the Casbah,'' said Hiroshmi Daifuku, an American consultant with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Mr. Daifuku is one of a small group of international experts working with Algerian architects on a project called The Conservation and the Rehabilitation of the Casbah of Algiers. **********There have been debates for the last decade over what to do about the Casbah, but until now no serious reconstruction plans were drafted. **********Some people argued that the Casbah should be emptied and converted into a museum and tourist area. Others thought that it was more urgent to resolve the housing shortage and that the whole place should be razed to make room for decent housing. A Plan for Restoration **********Two years ago, the Algerian Government turned to Unesco for help.  Tugrul Akcura, a Turkish professor of town planning who has worked on the restoration of the cities of Fez in Morocco and Mecca in Saudi Arabia, is considered the father of the new plan for the Casbah. **********Mr. Akcura and a team of foreign consultants together with young Algerian architects of the Atelier, or Workshop of the Casbah, have carried out detailed studies of the Casbah and drafted a renovation plan. The plan is to be submitted to the Algerian Government next month. **********''Our aim is to restore the urban fabric of the Casbah as a whole, physically, socially, economically,'' Raci Bademli, another Turkish consultant, told visitors in the Atelier offices, located in the ancient governor's palace, which itself is undergoing restoration. **********Mr. Bademli recently completed a study of small workshops in the Casbah, which became a slum area in the 1940's, when the modern, largely French section of the city emerged. There are today about 500 shops -jewelers and clockmakers, tailors and shoemakers, repairers and carpenters, leather-product makers and weavers - scattered hither and yon. Residential and Business Zones **********The upper part of the Casbah is scheduled to be restored as a residential quarter, Mr. Bademli said, with the workshops shifted to the lower Casbah, which will be zoned as a business district. **********''We're trying to reintegrate the Casbah into the life of the city,'' said Scheherazade Nafa, an Algerian architect, who added that under French rule the area had become a ''Moslem ghetto.'' **********The principal need is to establish a mechanism for financing the restoration, according to Mr. Akcura. He said that almost all property in the Casbah was privately owned and that the people did not have the money to pay for restoration. **********''The state will have to subsidize the works in part,'' Mr. Akcura said. He estimated that it would cost $140,000 to restore a house in the Casbah. The Housing Problem **********Algeria, however, already has a huge housing deficit. The people who lack any housing must be helped before the Government will consider the enormous improvements required in the Casbah, according to Algerians working on the Casbah project. **********Algeria's new five-year plan introduced last year emphasizes social needs, particularly housing, and calls for the construction of 100,000 dwelling units a year. Housing units are now going up at a rate of 20,000 a year, a pace that does not keep up with the population increase. **********There is also the problem of El Asnam, the city 100 miles southwest of Algiers that was devastated by an earthquake last October. At least 5,000 people were killed and 200,000 were left homeless. The city has become the Algerian Government's top priority, and most international aid has gone to the regugees of El Asnam. **********Nevertheless, the people of the Atelier said that it was becoming more urgent to to something about the Casbah. Of a total of 1,700 houses, there are 457 houses in ''very bad condition,'' compared with 100 five years ago, according to Ahmed Koumas, an Algerian architect. **********Houses are pronounced dangerous when it is apparent that they could fall down at any time. The familes who are forced to evacuate those houses are lodged in ''dormitories,'' dark cellars under the market. The Glory That Was **********A tour of the Casbah shows little of the glamour of the days of World War II or the Battle of Algiers in 1957, when the French besieged this nationalist fortress. **********Instead, there are children everywhere, playing in the rubble of a fallen house or in the garbage heaps in the few vacant lots. Sturdy donkeys, the only means of conveyance to master the steep cobblestone stairs, bring in goods of all kinds and serve as garbage collectors.  There are scenes of dire poverty - veiled women with plastic bags picking up dung to take home for use as firewood. **********''People with money are no longer interested in the old houses in the Casbah because they can't get to them by car and prefer a villa in the new city,'' Miss Nafa said. ''If we can make this a decent living area, I'm sure it will become fashionable again to come to the Casbah.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/19/business/italy-in-first-soviet-gas-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Italy in First Soviet Gas Deal", "print_headline": "Italy in First Soviet Gas Deal", "body_text": " **********Italy's state-owned gas company has signed a preliminary agreement to buy about 300 billion cubic feet of natural gas a year from the Soviet Union starting in 1984, officials said.

President Francois Mitterrand had made decentralization one of the key planks in his campaign platform. **********''We must rid ourselves of what remains of Napoleon's ancien regime,'' Mr. Mauroy said recently. **********Assembly Approval Certain **********''The men of the chateaus are gone now,'' he said, referring to the defeated Government of Valery Giscard d'Estaing. ''We must acomplish the historic task of creating a republic of citizens.'' **********The decentralization program, which is sure to be approved by the Socialist majority in the National Assembly, calls for a transfer of power from the departmental prefects, appointed by the Government in Paris, to regional and departmental councils. **********The plan, which will take effect over three years, in effect calls for the dismantling of a form of government that has been virtually unchanged for more than four centuries, except for the chaos of the Revolution, after which Napoleon re-established the strong central control that had existed under the monarchy. **********The first step in the new plan, to be carried out almost immediately, is to end the powers of the 21 regional and 96 departmental prefects. Their most important powers are negative. They have the right of veto over all administrative and fiscal actions approved by local governments. **********The second step, to be accomplished within a year, will exactly define the powers of the bodies replacing the prefects - the regional and departmental councils. The final segment of the plan will determine to what extent local authorities will be responsible for their own finances. **********Even some of Mr. Mitterrand's opponents in the campaign endorsed his decentralization proposal. There is almost no French citizen who has not suffered frustration at the hands of the central Government - or suffered neglect from it. Anyone who has read Balzac is familiar with the hatred and suspicion provincial France traditionally has felt for the Government in Paris. ''This is a country of petits fonctionnaires, little clerks,'' is a common and ancient complaint. Everything Through Paris **********Stories of waiting 10 years to get a road approved in Angouleme or four years to get a street name changed in Nimes are routine, for almost everything that is done by a government agency must pass through the appropriate ministry in Paris. **********The prefects, ranking civil servants with good Paris connections, have been transferred like ambassadors from one department to another with no thought to their familiarity with local problems or local politics. **********Under the proposed law, the elected leaders of local governing bodies, along with the elected regional and departmental councils, will have the right to determine their own budgets without advance approval from Paris or from the new ''commissioners of the republic,'' who will be appointed by Paris but who will have mostly consultative roles. **********At least that is what the Mauroy Government is saying. There are some skeptics. ''In France,'' said Charles-Noel Hardy, a Giscardian and prefect of the department of Loire-et-Cher until the Socialist victory, ''when one really doesn't want to change things fundamentally, one changes their name.'' Fiscal Watchdogs Curbed **********Also losing out in the new arrangement are the regional paymasters-general, budgetary watchdogs appointed by the Ministry of Finance in Paris who, like the prefects, have had absolute veto power over local expenditures. Their powers, too, are to be diminished. **********The new law has been dubbed the Defferre law after the Gaston Defferre, Interior Minister in the new Government, a long-time Socialist politician and Mayor of Marseilles for almost 40 years. **********Mr. Defferre has been in charge of preparing the decentralization legislation since Mr. Mitterrand's victory May 10. There is some irony in this since he has governed Marseilles with an iron hand and neither prefects nor fiscal inspectors nor even heads of state crossed him lightly. **********Not everyone approves of the new program. Objectors include those who believe the Constitution demands that such a profound change be put to the voters in referendum and leaders of the conservative political minority who see France's fundamental strength emanating from its strong central government. Prefects' Contribution Cited **********''It would be sad to see the title of prefect disappear,'' said Roger Genebrier, a former prefect, writing in Le Monde. ''Our corps has contributed enormously to the grandeur of the nation. The prefects assumed by delegation from successive governments the permanence and heavy responsibility of the general administration.  And in troubled times, they have been in the provinces the principal maintainance of the state and of the republic.'' **********Then too, many of the mayors of France's tiny villages - 90 percent of the country's 36,000 incorporated communities have fewer than 2,000 inhabitants - have neither the desire nor in some instances the competence to deal with fiscal matters. **********Andre Reny, the Mayor of Girancourt, a town of 516 people in the Vosges, said he had no faith in local democracy. He recalled a questionnaire about increasing local responsibilities that was sent to 520 mayors in his region in 1976. ''Only 121 of them responded,'' he said, ''and all they were interested in was how to get more money from the Government because of a serious drought we were having at the time.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/27/business/brazilian-gold-policy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brazilian Gold Policy", "print_headline": "Brazilian Gold Policy", "body_text": " **********The Brazilian Government has adopted a new gold policy aimed at increasing its reserves of the metal, the Finance Ministry said today.

Foley, the Democratic majority whip, both called the Reagan-backed Kemp-Roth plan dangerously inflationary. **********Tax Burdens 'Inequitable' **********Mr. Foley also said it was ''inequitable'' because it ''puts most of the tax relief on very high income people rather than on the bulk of the middle class.'' **********All three made their comments on television network news programs.  Mr. Regan was interviewed on ABC's ''Issues and Answers,'' Mr.  Rostenkowski on CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' and Mr. Foley on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' **********Mr. Rostenkowski, whose committee originates tax measures, acknowledged the President's political strength and declined to predict a victory for his own plan. Dangers of Tax Cut **********He said that many conservative Democrats and Republicans who supported the President in the budget vote shared his own view that a three-year tax cut and the larger deficits that it would entail would be ''dangerous'' in light of ''the unpredictability of the economy.'' **********He said that he would be open to discussions of a possible compromise with Republican leaders including the President.  Mr. Regan, on the other hand, said the Administration was ''standing firm'' on its proposed three-year tax cut as an ''integral part'' of the President's economic recovery program, and predicted an Administration victory. **********''The support is out there for President Reagan's tax cut proposals,'' Mr. Regan said. Popular Support **********''People actually do want a stop in the amount of money that they are paying to the Federal Government.'' he said.  Mr. Regan appeared to keep the door to possible compromise barely open by saying that he would listen to proposals for a tax cut smaller than the $54 billion that the Administration proposes for the first of the three years if they could ''accomplish the same thing.'' **********But he said that alternative proposals made so far, apparently including those made by Mr. Rostenkowski, ''would negate the effects of what the President wants to do,'' and ''would just be adding little baubles on.'' **********He denied that the Administration was in a mood to compromise ''even on dollar figures,'' at this point, although Republican leaders have said privately that the President may have to make some compromise eventually of about $40 billiion to retain about the same $10 billion saving for business that the President's plan calls for in the first year, and would save individuals about $14 billion less.

United States agribusiness conglomerates are said to be eyeing the industry, as are farmers in a number of foreign countries. **********For Dolores and Charles Rowland, soybean farmers in Humphreys County, Miss., raising catfish began eight years ago as ''just something to play around with, like a hobby,'' Mrs. Rowland said. **********But the couple say they have made more money in the last three years off their 70 acres of fish ponds than from their 1,000 acres of soybeans. ''We were using the fish to pay for our losses on beans,'' Mr. Rowland said, which moved them last year to quadruple their pond acreage and stop farming soybeans altogether. **********Catfish culture started in the mid-1960's as the hobby of a few entrepreneurial Mississippi and Arkansas farmers. It has now spread to some 70,000 acres in 16 states, mostly in the South. Mississippi leads with 63 percent of the pond acreage, followed by Alabama, Arkansas, California, Texas, Georgia and Missouri. The 1980 harvest brought in 76.7 million pounds of channel catfish worth $54 million to growers - double the haul just two years before. And the windfall led to a pond building explosion last year that will double the crop again in 1982. But compared with the 216.9 million pounds of flounder harvested last year, worth $82.5 million, catfish have a way to go. **********With supplies overflowing the traditional Deep South and Middle West markets, catfish processors began to hire salesmen to market the fish to restaurants and supermarket chains in Texas, the upper Middle West and California. The fish are now being shipped to 36 states, including Alaska and Hawaii. **********The toughest markets to crack, it is said, will be the seafood-rich Northeast and Northwest, where catfish is still disdained as a lowly ''trash fish,'' unfit for good eating. **********Mention of this unsavory fish is not without justification. The ''wild'' catfish tend to have flavor problems. They are by nature hardy scavengers that thrive in polluted waters, and as a result, their flesh can have a dank, musty flavor. About half the catfish sold in the United States belong to this wild variety, caught in American rivers and lakes or imported from the Brazilian Amazon. **********Farm-raised fish are more expensive than the wild type, but they have the advantage of being grown in a controlled environment and fed a high-protein grain, soybean and fishmeal diet. The product is not cheap - fillets retail around $3.69 a pound - but the flesh has a mild flavor, no odor, a low cholesterol and a lot of protein. **********Tommy Taylor, agriculture extension agent for Humphreys County in Mississippi, otherwise known as the Catfish Capital of the World, has taken a more optimistic outlook on the new product. ''You don't have to change people's taste to sell catfish,'' he said. ''Once they bite into it, they're hooked.'' One of Mr. Taylor's professional assets is that he can recite catfish recipes in rapid succession. All of them, he says, are ''so good they'll make you slap your Granma.'' **********To the grower, the appeal in catfish is the money. In a good year, catfish bring in three times more per acre than cotton and rice, and five times more than soybeans. **********Catfish are fairly invulnerable to such natural forces as drought and heat, and last year they thrived, despite the dry weather.  ''Farmers were sitting there watching their cotton and soybeans burn up,'' said Charles Estess, assistant agriculture extension agent for Humphreys County. ''That made catfish look all the better.'' **********Indeed, catfish have seemed such a promising investment that even high interest rates have not damped an epidemic of pond-building fever. In the Mississippi Delta, the heart of the industry, the pond acreage jumped by nearly 50 percent in 1980 and is expected to increase by at least 40 percent this year. **********A profitable catfish business first requires heavy clay soil to form a stable pond, a cheap supply of clean water, flat land and a warm climate. In Mississippi, which averages 240 days a year of weather no cooler than 65-degrees, six-inch fingerlings put in the ponds in March will usually be ready to harvest in November at 1 1/4 pounds, the size the processors prefer. **********And startup costs average between $3,500 and $4,000 an acre for land, pond construction and equipment, plus another $1,800 an acre for the first year's operations costs. **********T HERE are risks, however, chiefly oxygen depletion and disease. If oxygen levels in the pond drop too low, the fish will die within minutes. During the active growing months -March to October - farmers become fanatical pond checkers using special aerating equipment at night when oxygen levels are lowest. Sometimes an entire pond will die anyway - an instant loss of as much as $50,000. **********The disease problem is just as troublesome. Even to the experts, many ailments are still mysteries. A whole pond may thicken and the fish die within a few days. ''We're just completely in the dark,'' complained Neal Berryhill, president of Catfish Farmers of Mississippi, who himself lost $100,000 worth of fish last winter to disease. ''The research is years behind us. We're just feeding fish and crossing our fingers.'' **********But the rewards match the risks. With current prices the farmers get at around 70 cents a pound for whole, live fish, a good farmer will average at least $400 an acre per year in pretax profits. If all goes well, he can make twice that much. Part of the profitability is because of the fish's efficient protein-conversion ratio. It needs only 1.6 pounds of food to gain a pound of protein. For chickens, the ratio is 2.4 to 1. **********Promoting the fish seems to be as much as part of the growers as fingerlings and water. Besides Humphreys County calling itself the Catfish Capital, there is a Catfish Queen and a yearly Catfish Festival, complete with a Catfish Eating Contest and a Catfish Cookoff. The festival is held in Belzoni - the seat of the catfish capital - and draws a crowd of 20,000, a sizable number since in all of Humphreys Country there is only one 18-room hotel. **********Investment-hungry corporations, naturally, have started to test the catfish waters. Mark Freeman, executive secretary of Catfish Farmers of America, says he has been inundated with inquiries from major American and foreign companies. Mr. Freeman will not divulge company names, but says agribusiness corporations are showing the most interest. **********And it is not hard to explain all the interest. Even growers who complain most bitterly about the risks of fish farming tend to betray their satisfaction with the profits in subtle ways. What is the accepted ''cure'' for losing $50,000 worth of fish in 30 minutes? Three farmers put it this way recently: ''Sit down on the bank, open a bottle of Jack Daniels, and cry.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/08/world/bhuttos-detention-extended.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bhuttos' Detention Extended", "print_headline": "Bhuttos' Detention Extended", "body_text": " **********Pakistan's military Government has extended for 90 days the detention of the widow and daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Prime Minister, an official of their political party said.

''We don't.''

''When you ask me, I will say that I am Sichuanese,'' a woman in her late 30's said. ''But that doesn't mean that I expect to return to where I was born.'' **********Alluding to Taiwanese suspicions that a ''great China'' patriotism that the islanders do not share might prompt a Kuomintang government to accept a Peking offer one day, a senior official rejected a frequently heard contention that the Government was adamant in rejecting all Peking proposals largely because categorical opposition to the Communists was the Kuomintang's main claim to legitimacy for its rule over Taiwan. Flight of Talent Is Feared **********''We reject it for more practical reasons,'' he said. ''We would divide this country if we accepted negotiations with Peking, no matter how hard a stand we adopted.'' **********Government officials, businessmen and foreign business and banking representatives here offered another practical reason for the Government's almost automatic rejection of all offers from Peking.  To raise the possibility that Taiwan might surrender its independence, under whatever guarantees Peking offered, would shake faith in the continuation of the economic policies that have brought about one of the most booming economies in Asia, and lead to a flight not only of capital but also of entrepreneurs and technical and business talent. **********Many highly educated people here hold ''green cards'' that entitle them to permanent residence in the United States.  With surprising unanimity, which is rarely heard among Taiwanese commenting on Government declarations, various versions of the theme ''We have nothing to gain and everything to lose'' were heard in interviews and conversations. No one argued with the view that the Government spokesman, James Soong, expressed in two questions: ''What do we have to give away? What can we get?'' On most other issues, Mr. Soong does not express the views of the other people interviewed. U.S. Called the Audience **********Opponents of the Government also share the official view that Peking's offers are addressed to the United States rather than to Taipei. They are generally regarded as an attempt to depict Peking as conciliatory and Taipei as obdurate and thus to influence the Reagan Administration to weaken further its ties to the nationalists and reduce military sales. **********''If Peking really thought that reunification is a serious subject, they would not make a public ballyhoo but use more discreet channels that are available,'' a foreign professional analyst said. **********Speaking about the Governments on both sides of the Formosa Strait, a Taiwanese writer said: ''There isn't a popular Chinese Government.  We don't want the Communists, and we doubt the sincerity of the K.M.T. We fear one day they will go to the mainland and make a deal without asking us.'' **********Speaking of reunification under either existing regime, he said: ''I am not so ambitious. Maybe in the next generation they will have the wisdom to solve that problem. But the Kuomintang can't drop the idea. If they did consider Taiwan as separate from the mainland, as it is, they would have to change the Government and hold elections, and the President would be a Taiwanese. They would have no excuse to postpone all kinds of reforms.'' **********The state of emergency that has justified restrictions on democratic government since 1949 is based on the claim that the Nationalist Government rules all of China and that Taiwan is only one province in a country still engaged in civil war."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/15/business/auto-dealers-cut-inventories.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Auto Dealers Cut Inventories", "print_headline": "Auto Dealers Cut Inventories", "body_text": " **********New-car dealers reduced their domestic inventory by almost 200,000 units during August, the trade publication, Automotive News, reported today. **********The publication said that domestic new-car inventories totaled 1,485,692 on Sept. 1, down from 1,675,192 on Aug. 1, representing a decline to an average 64-day supply of cars from an 87.5-day supply. **********About 519,000 units in the current inventory are 1982 models, the weekly newspaper said.

The subcommittee urged that control standards for cars and trucks be made at least as stringent as those that have been in force in the United States since last June. **********The group described the nonferrous smelting industry as the largest source of sulfur dioxide emissions in Canada, and it urged that six major smelters in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec be forced to reduce their pollution by 80 percent within th e next five years. **********''Canada's nonferrous smelters are owned and operated by very profitable corporations which can afford to implement the necessary technology,'' it said. **********Ontario has begun to apply tighter controls on Canada's biggest single polluter, the smelter operated by International Nickel in Sudbury, which spreads sulfur dioxide over large areas of eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. Worried About Coal Use **********The subcommittee warned that the problem may worsen as the United States converts oil-fueled industries to coal and as Canada makes greater use of coal to generate electricity, notably in the Maritime provinces, which now rely heavily on oil-fired power plants. In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the coal has a high sulfur content. Two new stations in Ontario and Saskatchewan, close to the border, will burn low-sulfur coal. **********Canada and the United States signed a memorandum of intent in August l980 to study and control crossborder pollution. Talks on an agreement for controlling air pollution began last June, and the subcommittee urged that an agreement be signed by the end of 1982.  But it said new Canadian legislative, regulatory and enforcement measures, including heavy fines for noncompliance, should not wait for the completion of the agreement or further studies. **********''The time for protracted study of the acid rain problem has ended,'' the subcommittee said. ''The need for immediate action is clear and unequivocal.'' It said the United States ''should similarly act in good faith.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/12/business/advertising.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-12", "snippet": "THE first advertising campaign from Young & Rubicam for the Jamaica Tourist Board, seeking to sell the American traveler on the feeling of civility and gentility on the island, will begin to run Monday on television in seven markets.\n\nThe three 60...", "word_count": 719, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising", "print_headline": "Advertising", "body_text": " **********THE first advertising campaign from Young & Rubicam for the Jamaica Tourist Board, seeking to sell the American traveler on the feeling of civility and gentility on the island, will begin to run Monday on television in seven markets. **********The three 60-second TV commercials, prepared under William H.  Appelman, who is creative director and a vice president, are all made up of quick takes and comments from a variety of local people. All are affluent and most of the locations are steeped in affluence - the polo field, the expensive restaurant, the mansion. **********The campaign is one of three that Y.&R.; presented to the Jamaicans in rough form and the one that helped them win the business on April 6 from Intermarco U.S.A., the incumbent, and Benton & Bowles. **********''No reggae,'' Mr. Appelman said. ''No tourists frolicking around.  We're showing the people themselves and, through them, reflecting the island and its treasures. **********The new theme, he said, is: ''Make it Jamaica. Again.'' ''And that's saying, 'Come back, everything's O.K.' '' ''We're not appealing to the head,'' he explained. ''We're trying to talk to them though the heart, showing the pride the people have in their island.'' **********When Doyle Dane Bernbach had the business, three ad agencies ago, it tried some ''back'' theme lines, too: ''Take me back to Jamaica,'' and ''Welcome back to Jamaica.'' **********There may be something in that to appeal to the important travel agent segment. Travel agents, who tend to recomend destinations that customers will want to go back to, have a 68 percent rate of repeat business. Many travel agents, one travel advertising source believes, have not been recommending Jamaica to clients. **********Since 1975, when Caribbean travel suffered, Jamaica travel suffered more.  And now, with the eight-month-old conservative Government of Prime Minister Edward Seaga, the tourist unit has the mandate to turn things around. **********In a full-page ad in The New York Times in December, the Prime Minister was quoted as saying: ''I belive Jamaica's tourism industry is vital to a strong economy. In the coming months we will do everything possible to promote and develop tourism in Jamaica. Our people are committed to this.'' **********The difficulty of changing American perceptions of the island is reflected in the agency's use of the 60-second, more persuasive commercial, and by the fact that the $7 million budget (two-thirds in TV) is twice last year's budget. Some $2 million of the $7 million will come under the Jamaica Vacations program, which promotes charters through ads in newspaper travel sections. **********The advertising that breaks next week will all be in TV and will push summer vacations.  ''The sooner we get people down there the better the word will spread when they get back,'' Mr. Appelman said.  The markets on the schedule are New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami, Los Angeles, Dallas and Houston.  In the fall, when winter vacations are being planned, Minneapolis, St. Louis and perhaps Memphis and Tulsa, Okla., will be added. In addition, there will be newspaper advertising and a national print umbrella in news weeklies, and travel and trade publications. **********The television, aimed at more affluent adults 22 years old and up, will run during all parts of the TV day using a system borrowed from Wunderman, Ricotta & Kline, Young & Rubicam's direct marketing subsidiary: A station is given a budget and asked for the most efficient buy. It comes back with a schedule, which the agency checks out and approves. This replaces the normal agency practice of selecting the time and buying it. **********Jamaica is trying, through stressing wealth in its creative product, what Bermuda is attempting to do through its magazine selection: to attract a higher class of people than it was getting. **********''The people with more money,'' said Thomas Spangenberg, agency vice president, ''will stay longer and spend more money.''

Will an open-handed tax cut strewing money on the public like the gentle rain produce a return to industrialization? **********Come, let us reason together: Suppose we take the average individual taxpayer in 1981 and estimate his tax at, say, $5,000 a year. Now we give him a $500-ayear tax cut; that is $10 a week. Let's see how this individual's $500 might find its way back into the economy. **********In one week, he might buy an extra eight gallons of gasoline to drive the kids to the amusement park. Or in another week, his wife might buy a little better cut of meat. Maybe he saves the whole $500 and uses it to buy a Sony television set, in which case most of the $500 goes winging to Japan. Money trickled through the $2 trillion United States economy in this fashion is not likely to create great pools of new profits with which Bethlehem Steel can rebuild its forges. **********The supporters of the kind of tax cuts advocated by Congressman Jack Kemp would argue that the Kennedy tax cut in the early 1960's created more jobs and more income for the Government. However, the situation was somewhat different then: The United States was operating in a much more closed economy that was far more selfsufficient and paying far less than the $100 billion yearly now spent on imported oil. **********What is more, the Kennedy tax cut was not entirely free of inflationary byproducts. For that matter, the economic spurt in 1963 may have been the result of events other than the tax cut, like the increase in foreign sales and the growth of United States multinational corporations. **********There is no certainty over what effect the current tax-cut proposals would have. The ''X'' factor in the equation appears to be the way the money would be returned to the taxpayers. All of the tax bills that have been offered so far suggest that the money would be returned in a kind of hose-like spray - scattered over the population to fall where it may and to produce what it may. **********It is paradoxical that politicians who are so adept at developing specific taxes and specific methods of taking money out of the private sector are so careless about returning it. Shouldn't there be some kind of direction to the manner in which this money is returned to the private economy? Could@n't the tax reduction be made in such a way as to encourage consumer investment and savings, produce jobs, increase capital investment in plant modernization, and improve the value of the dollar? **********This could be accomplished if the consumer tax reduction was made with a temporary string attached. An individual receiving a $500 tax cut could be given one-third outright and the other two-thirds at the end of each tax year in the form of special Federal investment certificates. **********These certificates could be used to purchase a unique preferred class of stock in companies with capital improvement programs. The certificates could also be used to buy three- to five-year building certificates in savings and loan institutions. They could be applied to any class of investment that was involved with construction, capital-building, or domestic expansion. Smaller companies or nonstock companies might participate in the benefits of this new money through the Small Business Administration. **********Of course, big investors in the stock market and the mutual fund industry would benefit from such a plan, but only to a modest degree. If tax-cut money went into a special preferred class of stock, closed to all except the influx of tax funds, then there would really be no market in that category of stock, at least not for several years. **********O N the other hand, all investors certainly would benefit, since the regular market would boom in the face of this type of investment. And that boom would draw billions of Eurodollars, which would push the market higher still. **********The effect on interest rates should be rewarding, too. The presence of billions of dollars of new funds in the United States market would drive bank rates down to the 6, 7 or 8 percent level. What is more, the presence of this new capital pool would make additional sources of money available. If the General Motors Corporation could easily acquire $1 billion or $2 billion through such a program for a $10 billion rebuilding project, it would certainly have no trouble finding the other $8 billion through normal money markets. **********To qualify for such a program, the activities of recipient companies could be shaped to help the job market. Part of G.M.'s capital building program, for example, would have to involve training marginal workers. **********Of course, doctrinaire conservatives, as well as doctrinaire liberals, may object to the attachment of such Government strings on returning this tax money to the public. But there should be some order to the removal of excess taxation - anarchy is not necessarily a perfect alternative to tyranny. A little transitory logic and direction can do a lot toward making the remedy work."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/14/world/brezhnev-phone-call-said-to-have-protected-hard-liners-in-poland.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1981-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 653, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BREZHNEV PHONE CALL SAID TO HAVE PROTECTED HARD-LINERS IN POLAND", "print_headline": "BREZHNEV PHONE CALL SAID TO HAVE PROTECTED HARD-LINERS IN POLAND", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union interceded at a Central Committee meeting of the Polish Communist Party two weeks ago to insure that hard-liners in the Politburo were not purged, reliable Polish sources said today. **********These sources said that the hard-liners, Tadeusz Grabski and Stefan Olszowski, were retained after a letter was read from the Soviet Central Committee. The letter, sent when Soviet troops were on maneuvers in and around the country, reportedly said that ''Poland is at a critical moment'' and urged against any change in the Politburo or Central Committee for the sake of ''party unity.'' **********The letter reportedly was backed up by a phone call from Leonid I.  Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, to Stanislaw Kania, head of the Polish Communist Party, during a crucial two-hour recess of the Central Committee meeting. **********Mr. Brezhnev is presumed to have conferred with Mr. Olszowski when both attended a party congress in Czechoslovakia last week. This has prompted speculation among Western diplomats in Moscow, who believe that the Kremlin is losing confidence in Mr. Kania and may sponsor a move to put Mr. Olszowski in his place. **********Such a move, however, is virtually ruled out here, since Mr.  Olszowski represents a minority view among the leadership on how to deal with the crisis. He would clearly be unacceptable to the Central Committee and the vast majority of rank-and-file party members. The party base is moving rapidly in a liberal direction, and any attempt to impose a hard-liner as leader might set off a party rebellion. **********There is a precedent for ignoring Moscow's wishes. In 1956, the Polish party faced down Nikita S. Khrushchev and the threat of military intervention to elevate Wladyslaw Gomulka, then viewed by the Soviet Union as heretical, to be first secretary. Poles feel even more defiant now. **********The strains in the relationship between Moscow and Warsaw are not always apparent, but they are considerable at times. Two weeks ago, for example, Orbis, the Polish tourist agency, abruptly stopped all excursions to the Soviet Union without providing a reason. Officials have confirmed privately that the move was taken because a busload of Polish tourists was attacked there and some of them were badly injured. **********The Warsaw Pact maneuvers may have exacerbated the strains.

''What if we had called the national commission, and what if they had not called off the strike?

In addition, it charged, the new Administration adopted a number of belligerent measures, seeking to ''drown the national liberation movement in El Salvador in blood,'' promising ''continued arming of counterrevolutionary bands'' in Afghanistan, espousing the cause of ''terrorist groups'' in Angola, raising a Rapid Deployment Force for the Persian Gulf area and creating new flashpoints for armed conflict around the world. **********There is a way out of the dangerous situation created by the United States, the article continued, and that is to take up the proposals put forward by Mr. Brezhnev at the party congress."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/03/business/collins-foods-international-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COLLINS FOODS INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "print_headline": "COLLINS FOODS INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/30/world/soviet-press-is-criticizing-schmidt-harshly.html": {"writer_name": "John Vinocur", "pub_date": "1981-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 630, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET PRESS IS CRITICIZING SCHMIDT HARSHLY", "print_headline": "SOVIET PRESS IS CRITICIZING SCHMIDT HARSHLY", "body_text": " **********The Soviet press has recently made an unusually harsh series of attacks on Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, and West German correspondents in Moscow, quoting diplomatic sources, said the criticism was unlike anything seen in the Soviet media in Mr.  Schmidt's seven years in office. **********Some of the diplomatic reports have speculated about the possibility of a serious deterioration in West German-Soviet relations. A more current analysis among officials in Bonn was that Moscow was trying to increase pressure on the Chancellor and encourage those in his party who are seeking to block deployment in West Germany of NATO's new medium-range nuclear missiles. **********The main attack was in an unsigned article in Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper, but other, similar commentaries were carried by Tass, the Soviet press agency, and by the weekly Novoye Vremya. **********Writing of Mr. Schmidt's visit to Washington, Pravda said, ''Having confirmed there the American line toward the arms race and primarily that of nuclear armaments in Europe, the Federal Chancellor followed Washington along the path of aggravating the international situation.'' Schmidt's Tone Has Changed **********As if acknowledging how sharply Mr. Schmidt's position toward the Soviet Union had changed, the newspaper continued: ''It was not so long ago that he favored detente, defended the SALT II treaty and declared for good neighborliness with the Soviet Union.'' **********While in Washington, Mr. Schmidt did not use the word detente and referred to his concerns about Soviet expansionism and the Soviet arms buildup. The Chancellor, whose tone on the Soviet Union was cautious for the first year after its intervention in Afghanistan, became more directly critical this spring, saying in a state of the nation address April 12 that Soviet policy was essentially responsible for the ''world's darkened political horizon.'' **********The Soviet attacks on Mr. Schmidt were rejected by a Government spokesman here as ''totally baseless,'' but there was irritation in some areas of the Government coalition about what was seen as an attempt to discredit the Chancellor and to characterize him as a hostage of Mr. Reagan. Invitation Is a Complication **********The situation is complicated by an invitation from Leonid I.  Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, to Willy Brandt, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party and a former Chancellor, for talks in Moscow. A party spokesman indicated yesterday that Mr. Brandt would probably visit Moscow in June or July. **********Mr. Brandt has been a very much less avid supporter of the NATO missile plan than the Chancellor and recently described a decision by a party regional conference to call for its reconsideration next year at a national party congress as ''important and weighty.'' **********Newspaper editorials asked what purpose Mr. Brandt's trip to Moscow could serve, particularly since Mr. Brezhnev plans to come to Bonn in the autumn and could communicate directly with Mr. Schmidt any time. **********The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung commented: ''Now the Moscow leaders will try to influence developments in the Federal Republic over Schmidt's head. A visit to Moscow by Brandt would be especially in line with their interests. This is what they're striving for.'' The Opposition View **********Alois Mertes, the foreign policy spokesman of the opposition Christian Democrats, said Moscow was trying to turn Mr. Brandt into an ''anti-Schmidt'' who might persuade the Chancellor to change his ways. **********Mr. Brandt's attitudes were so carefully masked, Mr. Mertes charged, that the Russians hoped they could soften Bonn's position with his help. **********Mr. Mertes called the former Chancellor ''the secret leader'' of the forces in the Social Democratic Party who want to move closer to Moscow.

In the last last week or two, many lending institutions across the country have clipped off about a point. This break in rates comes during a period in which the sharp increases in home prices have also abated. In the last year, after a decade in which average prices almost tripled, housing prices dropped by about 10 percent after accounting for inflation and for discounts on financing granted by owners eager to sell. **********This is not, however, a new turn of the old cycle of prices and mortgages. The old cycle has been buried in the immense losses that the lenders have swallowed for letting homeowners reap the benefits of low-rate mortgages in a time of high inflation. From that era, a wholly new housing market is emerging. **********The terms of mortgages have been changed to favor the banks. The forces that allowed house prices to outperform just about all other investments in recent years have been deflated. Yet mortgage rates and prices, most analysts expect, are likely to remain relatively high, putting ownership of a single-family home beyond families that earn less than $30,000 to $40,000 or so.  ''Isn't it amazing, people say they can't wait for rates to get down to 13 percent,'' muses Anthony Downs, a housing expert and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''Right now 12 percent sounds like a red hot item.'' **********Of course, rates are still well above that level. Nevertheless, this season's break in mortgage rates and home prices makes buying a home easier than it has been in months. And because of that, some economists see a turnaround in the market beginning about now, and ending perhaps late next spring when they expect prices to begin creeping up again. **********Housing experts differ on the best way to approach the housing market now. Some advise waiting until rates fall further. Others recommend jumping in as soon as rates fall far enough for a house to be affordable. **********What seems to be developing in the housing market is a new opportunism that dictates playing the business cycle in buying a home and looking for dips in interest The new home-buying rules of thumb. Page 15. rates and housing prices rather than holding out for the much lower rates and prices that were available through the 1950's and 1960's. **********Kenneth J. Thygerson, a vice president at the Western Federal Savings and Loan Association of Denver and chairman of its subsidiary, the WestAmerica Mortgage Company, drew an analogy between the emerging home-buying strategy and the way companies seek financing. ''Corporations look for a window in the bond markets to do financing,'' he said. ''Now the individual has to do the same thing, and the window is just beginning to open now.'' **********While rates are likely to fall further still as the recession deepens through the winter, and perhaps into next spring, most economists predict that rates on fixed-rate, conventional mortgages will not drop much below 14 or 15 percent. Rates on variable-rate mortgages are likely to be somewhat below those of the conventional fixed-rate mortgages.  Robert Dall, a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc., said, ''Mortgage rates might come down to 14 percent by the end of the first quarter of 1982. But then I'd expect them to go right back up again.'' **********Peter Treadway, chief economist at Cralin Securities, an investment banking firm, and the former chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association, is even less optimistic.  ''Long-term mortgage rates may come down a little bit more,'' he predicted. ''But 15 percent is likely to be the bottom for fixed-rate mortgages, and anything below 15 percent will not last too long.'' **********While it is possible to find forecasts that call for somewhat lower mortgage rates, Kenneth L. Rilander, a vice president at Blyth Eastman Paine Webber, said, ''The only people who expect to see a more dramatic drop in mortgage rates are those who expect a very severe recession.'' **********For the home buyer, then, the trick is to find the best combination of mortgage rates and housing prices. Some bankers and real estate agents recommend buying as soon as possible, to take advantage of the depressed housing prices before they turn up. **********''The housing market is probably at rock bottom right now,'' said Mr. Treadway. ''While mortgage rates may still come down a little bit more, a home buyer could take out a mortgage now with an adjustable rate, and still benefit if rates fall further. The key is to try to develop flexibility.'' **********Others recommend waiting a few more months until mortgage rates have dropped a bit further, although there is a greater risk of waiting too long, until the decline in rates has stimulated demand and sent prices rising again. **********''I would advise someone who wanted a fixed-rate loan to wait a while longer, because rates are going to come down some more,'' Mr.  Dall of Salomon Brothers said. He said a few extra months would not necessarily cost the home buyer more on the price of a house, ''because there is still a backlog of homes to be worked off and because there are still financing problems that will keep buying activity slow.'' **********While the experts debate the best time for buying a home, they are united in the belief that the consumer should not try to pick the exact bottom in rates, since when rates do reach their lows they often turn up almost immediately. ''If the experts can't pick the bottom, most consumers probably won't be able to either,'' Mr.  Thygerson said. **********Indeed, one factor that is likely to help push mortgage rates up again is a sudden rush to buy houses or to renegotiate the mortgages on the houses they already own. **********''If rates come down, a lot of people sitting with properties are going to run out and refinance them,'' said James T. dePietro, a sales associate at First Minneapolis Realty. ''The demand for credit could be so great that it would just push those rates right back up again.'' **********W HATEVER the timing strategy, housing experts say there is a good deal of pent-up demand for housing, and that many people are expected to begin buying as rates continue to edge down. But instead of heralding a period of unlimited vigor, it is expected that the lower rates will usher in only a limited resurgence. **********''We are moving down from an impossible level to a slightly less impossible level,'' said Richard G. Marcis, chief economist for the Dallas Federal Savings and Loan Association, and until recently the chief economist for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. He noted that the current level of rates was still too high for most people to jump back into the market. ''The real key will be to get rates down to 14 or 15 percent, where some segment of potential home buyers will begin to qualify for mortgages,'' he said. **********N. Leo Beller, an assistant vice president for real estate loans at the Bank of America, illustrates the affordability problem with the example of a family that is seeking a $100,000 mortgage for the purchase of a $125,000 house. For a 17 percent mortgage, monthly mortgage payments would run about $1,425, and a typical lender would probably look for yearly income of $62,400, Mr. Beller said. ''That's twice the average household income in California,'' he said. **********If mortgage rates were 15 percent, he said, the income requirement would fall to $55,900 for that same mortgage application. If rates fell another point, to 14 percent, the income requirement would still be $52,750. **********That continuing affordability problem is a grim reminder that while the recession will bring some relief by lowering interest rates, consumers are not likely to find the market they knew 10 or 20 years ago. It was a market that housed and enriched millions of Americans for several decades, but it was also based on a financial structure that helped to drive the thrift industry close to bankruptcy. **********For while mortgage rates will fall during the downturn of each business cycle, other changes have been taking place - especially in the way in which homes are financed - that will not be reversed. **********These more permanent transformations, which are still in the process of evolving, include everything from who makes mortgage loans to the kinds of mortgages that are available. And the home buyer attracted by lower interest rates will still have to be prepared for the other changes in the marketplace. **********The shift in who is willing to make mortgages is expected to continue. Traditionally, savings and loans have been the largest mortgage lenders. Because of low earnings and outflows of deposits, however, many of them have stopped making mortgages. Mergers of troubled associations have also reduced the number of institutions making mortgage loans. Commercial banks have picked up some of that slack. But many of them are willing to make a mortgage only if they know they can resell it to a pension fund or other institutional investor. **********New kinds of mortgages will continue to displace the traditional long-term, fixed-rate mortgage. It is still possible to get a 30-year mortgage with a fixed rate, but fewer of them are available. In their place are mortgages with shorter terms and with interest rates that vary during the life of the mortgage. The forms are still proliferating, as lenders and buyers search for a new formula that will please both. ''There will be a panoply of mortgages available, and the best deal will really be a matter of doing a heck of a lot of shopping around,'' Mr. Thygerson advised. **********''Creative financing'' will remain prevalent. Instead of bank mortgages, many home buyers have been receiving financing from relatives, friends or the people selling the house. This kind of financing now takes place in about 60 percent of all home sales, according to a broad survey just completed by the National Association of Realtors. **********The survey also found that the average interest rate on these loans is 13 percent, well below the rates available on more traditional mortgages. People who cannot afford even the lower bank mortgage rates predicted for next spring are likely to continue to use these new financing methods, so long as they remain less expensive, said Jack W. Carlson, executive vice president of the association. **********House prices should start rising again by mid-1982, but the increases will be much more moderate than in the late 1970's. Any decline in house prices is likely to end when mortgage rates fall to about 14 percent, although it may not happen immediately because there will be inventories of housing to be sold off. When that is finished, economists predict, prices will again begin to rise, although the large price gains that outstripped both the inflation rate and many other forms of investment are not likely to return soon. **********''Owning housing is not going to be the windfall it has been,'' said Mr. Downs of Brookings. ''In the future, people shouldn't be as reluctant to rent, since the advantages of owning are now greatly weakened.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/29/world/around-the-world-us-and-egypt-discussing-sinai-peacekeeping-force.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. and Egypt Discussing Sinai Peacekeeping Force", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; U.S. and Egypt Discussing Sinai Peacekeeping Force", "body_text": " **********The United States and Egypt resumed talks here today on forming a multinational peacekeeping force to patrol the Sinai peninsula when Israel completes its withdrawal from there next year.

Prices have been plummeting since mid-1981. So what is the basic message of the market? **********''It's saying that we are heading into a recession,'' declared A.  Marshall Acuff Jr., investment strategist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********At Goldman, Sachs & Company, the chairman of the investment policy committee concurred. Leon G. Cooperman amplified his recession forecast by stating: ''We believe the economy is likely to be stagnant over the next three quarters.'' **********If this is the case, where does an investor find the best protective cover to survive a business slowdown with a minimum of bumps? **********The accepted wisdom of Wall Street is that certain stock groups weather a recession better than others - although even these ''defensive'' sectors offer no sure-fire guarantee against falling prices. ''It's like combat,'' a money manager said. ''Instead of getting killed, you may escape with some minor wounds.'' **********Merrill Lynch, in a study of group performance during the last seven recessions, found certain sectors did consistently better than the overall market. **********''Among these are drugs, foods, utilities, soaps and banks,'' according to the nation's largest brokerage house. ''Companies that produce day-to-day necessities such as soap, food and drugs tend to be good performers because their businesses are less affected by recessionary forces. **********''Interest-sensitive groups such as utilities and banks tend to do well, because lower interest rates, which usually accompany a recession, help to moderate their operating and financing costs.'' **********But a person does not necessarily make money -or even hold portfolio losses to a minimum - by following past scenarios.  In last year's short but sharp business downturn, for example, soap stocks fared poorly. Three months into the teeth of the 1980 recession, the soaps sank 15.2 percent, while Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 5.4 percent. Then, six months after the onset of that recession, soap stocks were ahead a mere 1.1 percent, while the broad market index gained 5.8 percent. **********Oil stocks, which often slide during a recession, turned in snappy gains last time. Six months after the recession began, this group had scored an advance of 30.6 percent, reflecting the frantic search for ''inflation-hedge'' issues prevailing at the time. **********''So far, in the face of the oncoming recession, the more defensive stock groups seem to be adhering pretty much to past patterns,'' Mr.  Cooperman said. **********There exists no clearcut consensus among analysts pointing to emerging new groups that could outperform the market in the next recession. **********One possible candidate is the funeral service business. The basic rationale here is that th e death rate is rising - recession or no recession - a nd certain companies stand to benefit. Hillenbrand Industries, t he leading manufacturer of finished burial coffins, is the choice of Prescott, Ball & Turben, a Cleveland-based brokerage firm. Smith B arney's pick is the Service Corporation International, whose activit ies embrace funeral homes, cemeteries, crematories and flower shops. **********Other possibilities: drug store chains, producers of bank checks, telephone companies and service companies that clean and maintain office buildings. Some analysts, meanwhile, detect recession-resistant qualities in hospital-management companies. One caveat for investing in this group, however, could be the matter of price, inasmuch as some companies have scored huge market advances in recent years and now carry fairly lofty price-earnings ratios. **********Group performance in the next recession depends upon certain variables, including the length of the slowdown and the level of interest rates. **********One way to build a ''defensive'' portfolio is to find industries that seem to have something extra going for them this time around.  Using this approach, Smith Barney's Mr. Acuff sees good things ahead for two broad market segments that would benefit from a slowgrowth economy and a declining inflation rate. These are the electric utilities and the insurance stocks, specifically fire-andcasualty and multiline companies. **********''While traditionally regarded a s defensive investments, the utility and insurance stocks could assume a l eadership position in the economic environment we envisage and thus take on offensive - or more dynamic - characteristics,'' he explaine d. **********Specific purchase recommendations by Smith Barney in utilities have included Consolidated Edison, Dayton Power and Light, Delmarva Power, Pacific Power and Light, Southern California Edison, Texas Utilities and Wisconsin Public Service. **********The firm's suggested ''buy'' list of insurance issues - a group that generally has suffered from investor disfavor for several years - includes Aetna Life and Casualty, the INA Corporation and the U.S.  Fidelity and Guaranty Company. Bache Halsey Stuart Shields Inc. also favors the outlook for electric utilities. **********Mr. Cooperman's current strategy takes a different approach. He noted that several groups that are sensitive to perceived changes in interest rates, particularly large money-center banks and electric utilities, have outperformed the overall stock market recently. **********But rather than stick with these groups now, he would choose to ''play'' the actual decline in interest rates elsewhere. His top choice is not some recession-resistant stock group but intermediateterm bonds with a maturity of 10 years or less. **********It's not that Mr. Cooperman is bearish on the stock market at this point, in the face of the sharp decline of recent months. But he feels that bonds, along with cash equivalents, offer a safer haven for a while, at least. **********Some stock groups that have fared poorly on a relative basis during a recession in the past have included home furnishings, textile products, electrical household appliances, automobiles and building materials. **********High technology stocks can suffer in the face of a business slump, according to John R. Groome, who heads investment research for the United States Trust Company. ''A case in point is the price decline in semiconductor stocks, which are reflecting a slowdown in capital spending,'' he said. **********Texas Instruments and the Intel Corporation, leaders in the semiconductor industry, have sustained sharp price drops this year.  Imminent recessions also can be hard on former market stars. Apple Computer traded early last week below $15, in the wake of lowered earnings estimates by some analysts. When this maker of personal computers made its eagerly awaited market debut in December, it sold as high as $29.25. **********What investors must bear in mind, of course, is that groups or individual stocks whose prices falter in the face of a recession often reach a level where they become attractive for potential market gains. Here the secret of success has not changed. It's simply a matter of stock selection and timing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/10/business/company-news-corco-expects-end-of-chapter-11-status.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Corco Expects End Of Chapter 11 Status", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Corco Expects End Of Chapter 11 Status", "body_text": " **********Judge Joseph C.

So when Arab heads of state gather at Fez on Wednesday, Nov. 25, they will find themselves in a city whose spirit and power have run well beyond the high crenelated walls that girdle it, past the magnificent vistas that strikingly recall those of Jerusalem, a place that will certainly figure on their agenda. **********King Hassan II, who will be host to the meeting of the Arab League, has seen to it that Fez, whose 570,000 people are mostly crammed into the maze-like old city behind the walls, is being spruced up. Hotels are being refurbished, walls and road signs repainted and roads cleaned; a lot of money is being spent at a time when the Moroccan exchequer is dry. **********Opposition Party Curbed **********The King clearly wants no domestic embarrassments during the Fez meeting, and some link his crackdown on the Socialist opposition - whose leader, Abderrahim Bouabid, has been arrested -to this desire to keep a lid on things. **********The meeting will bring Fez momentary international luster. But in Morocco the mystique of the city is fading as powerful and wealthy natives abandon it for Casablanca, the teeming commercial metropolis, or Rabat, the capital and center of political advancement. **********''Fez is no longer the city of the bourgeoisie,'' said Mohammed Ben Said, a Socialist politician, offering a visitor a plate of sweet cakes and mint tea. ''It is now the city of the proletariat, with a little bit of the lower middle class.'' **********Confirmation of this downward sociological shift came in the 1977 municipal and parliamentary elections. Fez had traditionally been a fief of the Istiqlal, a nationalist party led by wealthy Fassis, as Fez natives are called, but the Socialists took all four of the city's seats in Parliament. The Socialists won 19 of the 39 municipal council positions to the Istiqlal's 16. But after some political maneuvering, in which an independent councilor was said to have been kidnapped, the Istiqlal stapled together a coalition that now runs city hall. King Keeps People Waiting **********King Hassan, who moves his court around from one sumptuous palace to another, has a habit of keeping important people waiting. A year ago, the ruler stirred a serious diplomatic furor by arriving 54 minutes late for a dinner that Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, on a state visit, held for him on the royal yacht Britannia, and by otherwise switching her program. **********''Going to Morocco is rather like being kidnapped,'' Princess Margaret is said to have told the Queen. ''You never know where you are going or when.'' **********It was nothing especially noteworthy, then, that King Hassan twice recently fixed and then at the last minute switched the appointments for Joseph Verner Reed Jr., the new American Ambassador, to present his credentials, and kept Prime Minister Mohammed Maati Bouabid and his new Cabinet waiting around in the Hotel de Fes to be sworn in. **********Hanging around and waiting for the King is almost a Moroccan political art form. An easygoing camaraderie develops among those called upon to wait. **********Sitting in the lobby of the Hotel de Fes, Yevgeny V. Nersesov, the Soviet Ambassador, disclosed that he had been summoned to the palace, presumably to be lectured on allegations that Moscow has been supplying sophisticated SAM-6 missiles to the Polisario guerrillas fighting the Moroccan army in Western Sahara. Ambassador Nersesov attempted with a joke to deflate the accusation: ''A Moroccan minister friend admitted to me that any American gangster can get his hands on a Kalashnikov'' - the Soviet assault rifle. Diplomacy at a Poolside Bar **********Chattiness is not limited to the Soviet camp. One night, at the poolside bar of the Hotel Jamai, Francis J. West Jr., Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, was speaking, loudly, on the phone to a colleague about American plans for strengthening the Moroccan forces against the Libyan-armed Polisario. **********''Are you on a secure telephone?'' called out the red-headed Mr.  West to the American at the other end of the line. Then, in only vaguely elliptical language, he discussed last-minute snags in the negotiations, the involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency station chief and commitments that had been made to ''the top man'' - King Hassan - that could not be broken at the last minute. **********Sitting down in the bar with Col. Maj. Mohammed Kabbaj, the head of the Moroccan air force, Mr. West delivered a forceful argument on the need for the 80,000 Moroccan troops in the Sahara to stage behindthe-lines commando operations against the guerrillas, as Egypt did in its 1977 border war with Libya. Colonel Kabbaj parried with a preference for sweeps by large formations, which he said were easier to control. U.S. Training Aid Offered **********Mr. West told the Moroccan that the United States was willing to train commando units, and even discussed the public relations aspects of American aid to counter the Soviet SAM-6 missiles.  ''Diplomatically, if we say that we are training SAM-killers, obviously that means they can go in after all kinds of other equipment,'' the American explained. **********The two men and Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, an American Air Force officer, then adjourned for dinner, leaving two journalists intently watching an Egyptian soap opera on a soundless television set in the corner of the bar. **********Such matters of state are of little concern in the countryside around Fez. A cruel drought, which some say is the worst to have afflicted Morocco in this century, has driven a new generation of poor off the land and into the miserable slums that encircle Fez. **********Out on the burnt land, farmers plow their fields, wait and pray.  October should have brought rain, but did not. More time has passed, without relief. **********''I usually sow on Oct. 20,'' said Ben Abu Brek, a spindly 65-yearold wheat farmer who works 18 acres near the Roman ruins of Volubilis. ''Last year we lost the whole crop. One more year like that will be a disaster.

Pentagon officials insist that the Saudis will be unable to handle the $400 million, ultrasophisticated Awacs on their own in the foreseeable future. **********In addition to the Awacs, the Administration plans to sell Saudi Arabia fuel tanks and advanced air-to-air missiles for the 62 F-15 fighters now on order. The Air Force also intends to sell the Saudis about seven ground radar stations to receive information from the Awacs. Saudi Apprehension Is Issue **********The Administration asserts that these moves will ease Saudi apprehension about American willingness to bolster regional defenses and will provide advanced equipment in case American forces have to be sent into the region to fight a war. **********The Administration's original intention, before Mr. Haig left on his trip to the Middle East on April 3, was to inform Congress officially of the Saudi package on April 27, the day it returns from its Easter recess. **********Then Mr. Haig was told in Jerusalem by Prime Minister Menachem Begin that Israel regarded the Awacs sale as a major threat to its security, that the high-flying Awacs could detect movements throughout Israel and would neutralize Israel's ability to make a surprise attack. **********While Mr. Haig was in the Middle East, supporters of Israel in Washington also began to flex their muscles. The contemplated Awacs sale led to widespread opposition, even among Republicans, on Capitol Hill. So far, 47 senators and about 100 Congressmen have spoken out against the projected sale. **********Under current law, the sale could be blocked if majorities in both houses of Congress vote against it within 30 days of receiving formal notification. No arms sale has ever been blocked by Congress, but the Administration, aware of Saudi sensitivities, does not want a bruising battle. Gesture to Israel Is Sought **********The sale could be made more acceptable to Congress if the Saudis would undertake commitments not to use the planes against Israel, to offer support for the American-sponsored Camp David peace process, to condemn the Palestine Liberation Organization, or to offer some other gesture to Israel. But the political maneuverings of the Arab world make such gestures out of the question. **********American officials contend that the Awacs pose no threat to Israel and that the Saudis would never use them against Israel for fear that the Israelis would shoot them down. But with Israel in the opening phases of its election campaign, no Israeli politician will do anything but express strong opposition to the projected sales to Saudi Arabia. This, in turn, will only fan criticism on Capitol Hill."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/10/world/polish-ex-leader-is-under-inquiry-graft-is-suggested.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1981-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GRAFT IS SUGGESTED", "print_headline": "POLISH EX-LEADER IS UNDER INQUIRY; GRAFT IS SUGGESTED", "body_text": " **********A former Polish Prime Minister is under investigation by the state prosecutor for decisions made while in office, and a similar case may be prepared against the former party leader, Edward Gierek, a newspaper reported today. **********The paper, Zycie Warzawy, did not disclose the details of the investigation against Piotr Jaroszewicz, the former head of Government. However, many rank-and-file members of the Polish Communist Party have demanded that Mr. Jaroszewicz and other top party leaders be tried for mismanaging the country's economy. **********Mr. Jaroszewicz, who was dropped as Prime Minister at a party congress in February 1980 and was expelled from the party several months ago, is widely reported to have enriched himself during his 10 years in office. In addition, his son was given a lucrative job heading an automobile importing agency while Mr. Jaroszewicz was Prime Minister. **********Gierek Still in Party **********Mr. Gierek has been stripped of all his positions but he is still nominally a member of the party. He has not been seen in public since he was ousted in disgrace on Sept 6, a week after the signing of the agreement permitting a free trade union in Poland. **********As the country's economic situation has continued to deteriorate, in part because of the crushing burden of foreign debts run up by Mr. Gierek's Government, public anger against him has grown. So far, the party leadership has fended off demands for action against him, out of respect for the high position he held. But there is a groundswell of sentiment against him, both inside and outside the party, and the leadership may soon have to acknowledge it. **********The anger has been increased by continuing revelations about the privileges afforded high party members during the Gierek years. One newspaper interviewed Mr. Gierek's daughter, who disclosed that she shopped on the third floor of Warsaw's main department store at a special ''yellow curtain'' shop, stocked with goods unobtainable elsewhere and closed to all but dignitaries. **********Mr. Gierek, fond of high-priced imported suits and expeditions to exclusive hunting lodges, lived in a number of luxurious villas. A small but irksome details was added by the country's foremost muckraking newspaper, Gazeta Krakowska, which suggested that a special scientific degree awarded to the party leader by Cracow's Academy of Mining and Metallurgy was fradulent. The former first secretary called the allegation libelous in his only newspaper interview since being dismissed. **********Mr. Gierek, citing ill health, has refused to appear at Central Committee meetings to defend himself. When he was ousted, a heart attack was given as the reason. **********During a recent meeting with party activists, Kazimierz Barcikowski, a Politburo member, was asked why Mr. Gierek was allowed to remain in the party. He replied that the former leader could not be treated in the same way as Mr. Jaroszewicz. He said that Mr.  Gierek was enjoying a pension and was probably playing happily with his grandchildren. **********The news of the investigation into the Prime Minister came in a small item buried in today's issue of Zycie Warszawy. The Warsaw paper reprinted an account from a local newspaper in Bydgoszcz about a press conference in which the first secretary from Wloclawek, Edward Szymanski, revealed the investigation. 2 Hard-Liners May Be Purged **********Mr. Szymanski was the Central Committee member who campaigned at a heated party meeting on March 29 against accepting the resignations of two hard-line members of the Politburo. At the news conference, however, he indicated that the hard-liners would be purged at a party meeting later this month. **********The delegates at the March 29 meeting called on party leaders to go into the factories to listen to the rank and file.  This afternoon, Stanislaw Kania, the party's first secretary, met with thousands of workers in a sports hall inside the Gdansk shipyard, birthplace of the Solidarity free trade union. He ran into an avalanche of criticism. Workers charged that the Politburo was out of touch with the mood of the country and that the game of ''musical chairs'' - switching old leaders around instead of letting new ones rise - was getting the nation nowhere."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/06/world/around-the-world-iran-says-it-destroyed-iraqi-bombers-in-raid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 193, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iran Says It Destroyed Iraqi Bombers in Raid", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Iran Says It Destroyed Iraqi Bombers in Raid", "body_text": " **********Iran's Defense Minister, providing details on an announcement yesterday, said today that eight Iranian aircraft had destroyed a number of Soviet-built TU-22 long-range bombers and some long-range fighters at the Iraqi base of Haj Sen near the Jordanian border.

Wednesday **********(4 A.M., Wednesday, E.S.T.) By 28 December, socialized and private farms delivered to the procurement points just over 90,000 tons of meat. That is, 75 percent of the month's plan. **********Since the middle of December, the procurement of livestock has improved. An average of over 5,000 tons is procured daily, but 6,000 tons are required. **********In order to supply the population, 1.1 million tons of potatoes have been procured; of this, 134,000 tons have been set aside as winter reserves. This is 300,000 tons short of the amount needed to provide full supplies to the market according to the calculations of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Economy. **********Abuses to Be Investigated 7:30 P.M. Wednesday **********(1:30 P.M. Wednesday E.S.T.) **********Here is a communique on the results of the investigations of cases of abuse of position for material gain: 1. In 1980-81 numerous reports were submitted to prosecutors from various social circles - work forces, social and union organizations and also private citizens. The reports accused numerous persons performing responsible state and party functions. Common accusations involved the use of social property for constructing villas and vacation houses and for fitting out living quarters above the usual standard, accepting expensive gifts and irregularities in the distribution of tokens entitling the purchase of passenger cars. **********As a rule the reports were not supported by the necessary evidence. Hence they demanded detailed examination. On examination, some appeared to be untrue and to have been tendentious. Most proved to be true, and the persons who exposed the misdeeds were guided by social interest and a desire to eliminate from public life damaging and negative phenomena. **********Numerous inspections had been carried out in order to establish that the accusations are correct. Apart from the investigations to establish the true character of earlier accusation, the Supreme Control Chamber, regional boards of state revenue and financial control and other state control bodies have also made wholesale investigations aimed at disclosing abuses connected with the use of prominent posts in the organs of state and economic administration for personal advantage. **********Based on the results of the investigatons other materials, the prosecutor's offices began penal proceedings. The complicated character of many cases and also the existing legal procedure required comprehensive expert reports which contributed to the drawn-out nature of the proceedings. **********2. The results achieved so far are follows: 263 persons have been charged with offenses. Temporary arrest has been applied to 101 persons. Investigations have been completed on 181 persons.  Indictments have been submitted to the courts against 154 persons.  Preliminary proceedings against 7 persons have been discontinued. The remaining cases are in the final stage of proceedings and it is expected that these will be completed in January or February of next year. The cases which are currently being completed include the investigations against Communist Party Central Committee former first Secretary Edward Gierek and former Deputy Prime Ministers Tadeusz Wrzaszczyk, Jan Szydlak and Franciszek Kaim. **********3. Trials are in progress against 27 persons, as has already been reported by the press. The public will be informed about the completion of proceedings and their results. **********Unionists Punished 7:30 P.M. Tuesday **********(1:30 P.M. Tuesday E.S.T.) The press spokesman of the Prosecutor General reports that more cases of persons charged with violating the regulations of the decree on martial law were tried on Dec. 23 at military district courts and provincial courts, under summary proceedings. **********The court of the Silesian miliary district has sentenced Andrzeu Pawlki, head of the transporation and supples section in the Solidarity chapter in lower Silesia, to 8 years in prison, has taken away his public rights for 5 years and has taken his automobile, after having found him guilty of transporting leaflets in his car containing false information for dissemination which could have aroused public unrest. **********The Jelenia Gora provincial court has sentenced Jan Filipek to 3 years in prison and loss of public rights for 3 years, finding him guilty of preparing of proclaiming strikes in the construction materials factory in Boleslawiec. **********The Bielsko-Biala provincial prosecutor has issued arrest warrants for Partycjusz Kosmovski, chairman of the interfactory founding committee of Solidarity of the sub-Beskids region, and Waclaw Szlegier. It is suspected that even after Dec. 13, as members and activists of the suspended Solidarity, they have not stopped their participation in further union activities and have embarked on the organization of protest actions against the martial law already in force. **********Soviet Aid Delivered 7:30 P.M. Tuesday **********(1:30 P.M. Tuesday E.S.T.) Continuously intensive transloading of large food consignments from the Soviet Union for Poland has been taking place during the past few days at eastern border stations. Deliveries of meat, initiated during the last 10 days of November, reached peak intensity in the second half of December. So far, more than 32,000 tons of meat have been received at Malaszewicze and Zurawica and have been transloaded from broad-guage Soviet cars into Polish state railways vehicles. There has been notification that 8,000 tons more meat from the Soviet Union and 2,000 tons from Mongolia will be arriving in the next few days.  Canned fish, mandarin oranges, raisins, fruit juices and other foodstuffs from the Soviet Union have also been received and transloaded at the border station. Large supplies of rice have begun in the past few days. **********Production Increasing 5:18 P.M. Wednesday **********(11:18 A.M. Wednesday E.S.T.) **********All Warsaw factories and plants worked full steam from early morning on December 30. The city transport functioned smoothly.  Thursday is the traditional celebration of the end of the year and the welcoming of the New Year. This year Warsaw residents will celebrate only at home, amid their relatives and friends But already today business at the hairdresser's is very lively and ladies buy evening dresses as usual for the occasion. **********Railway transport across the country functioned normally. To insure smooth railway services, 22,500 persons were engaged removing snow from tracks and railway stations. Among them were 6,500 workers of various enterprises and several hundred troops. **********Coal extraction is increasing. On Dec. 9 miners supplied 595,400 tons of coal. This is the highest daily extraction reached after the introduction of martial law in Poland. **********The two collieries in Tychy, Ziemowit and Piast, are gradually coming back to their normal production rhythm. However, after a long standstill machinery and installations require detailed survey. That is why the collieries have not reached their full daily capacity yet. On Dec. 29 miners in the Ziemowit colliery extracted 7,100 tons of coal (their daily plan is 23,500 tons) and miners in the Piast colliery supplied about 12,000 tons of coal (daily plan - nearly 17,500 tons). **********Espionage Charged 7 P.M.

Percy, Republican of Illinois, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He made the statement after a closed-door briefing from Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. on the Administration's assertions that arms supplied by the Soviet Union, Cuba, Ethiopia and Vietnam had been sent to the Salvadoran insurgents. No Decision Is Reached **********Although William J. Dyess, a State Department spokesman, said that the Administration had not decided whether, or how much, additional military and economic assistance would be needed for El Salvador, various Senators and Representatives appeared favorably inclined in advance to requests that might be submitted. **********El Salvador, which is ruled by a military-civilian junta, is receiving $73.5 million for this fiscal year, of which $10 million is in military aid. **********Representative James C. Wright Jr., Democrat of Texas, who is the House majority leader, said after Mr. Haig's briefing that ''Central America is probably more vitally important to us than any other part of the world.'' **********''Our response to what is happening there requires a bipartisan, unified approach and I fully expect that that is what the President and the Secretary of State will receive,'' he said. **********Mr. Percy was asked if his pledge to do ''whatever is necessary'' was meant to include the dispatch of American combat troops to El Salvador. He said that such a move ''would be highly unlikely'' but he declined to ''rule out any options.'' **********''I am simply saying that we will do what is necessary to resist outside intervention,'' he said. ''We will not stand idly by while outside forces - outside our hemisphere or within our hemisphere - are feeding arms to one particular faction attempting to bring down what looks to be a centrist government.'' **********''The Administration is reaching out seeking Congressional support,'' Mr. Percy said. ''They will have that support.'' So far the Administration has not made public what Mr. Dyess described today as ''the very solid, increasing evidence that the leftist guerrillas are being supplied with arms from the outside.'' **********In addition to sharing the material with members of Congress throughout the day, the Administration has sent special envoys to Europe and Latin America to brief other governments on the data in an effort to win their political backing. **********Officials said that a ''white paper'' would be made available later in the week.  They said that the information, which they said was compiled from a number of sources including documents captured from the insurgents, disclosed that the rebels had been supplied with Soviet- and American-made military equipment shipped to El Salvador from as far away as Vietnam. Arms From Vietnam Reported **********The Administration says, for instance, that large amounts of captured American military equipment had been sent from Vietnam to Cuba by the Soviet Union. From Cuba, the equipment was said to have been shipped to Nicaragua, from where, according to these accounts, it was slipped into El Salvador by sea and air and by land through Honduras. **********Mr. Haig has indicated privately that he sees the situation in El Salvador as an early test of relations with both American allies and with the Soviet Union. He seems to want to make El Salvador a demonstration of allied unity and an example of Soviet overseas ''expansionism.'' **********Support for the Salvadoran Government in this country has been weakened, however, by its seeming inability to crack down on rightwing groups that have carried out political assassinations. **********Of particular concern was the murder in December of four American churchwomen. For a while, American aid to El Salvador was suspended as a result of the killings. Aid Resumed in January **********The Carter Administration, which had suspended the aid, resumed it shortly before leaving office because of the increased guerrilla activity. The Reagan Administration said last week that it had ''delinked'' the question of aid to El Salvador from the question of a thorough investigation by Salvadoran authorities into the death of the Americans. **********But Senator Percy said today he had told Secretary Haig that ''it is absolutely crucial'' that the Salvadoran authorities find out who murdered the churchwomen. He said that resolution of the matter was very important to Americans. Mr. Dyess said the Administration was pressing for action on the matter. **********The Senate Majority Leader, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, said the briefing he had received from Mr. Haig was ''alarming.''

Within days, Antoine's regular customers received letters reminding them that New Orleans had been chosen as the Super Bowl City for 1981, suggesting that they should make reservations without delay if they wished to dine at Antoine's during the weekend of the game. And, days later, almost 500 of the 650 chairs in the restaurant were reserved for dinner -on Jan. 24, 1981. **********Yes, by July 1979 the Super Bowl XV rush was on - for the best restaurants with the biggest names, the best rooms at the most glamorous hotels and the longest, sleekest limousines with the plushest built-in bars and television sets. **********For Super Bowl, in the words of a New Orleans executive, is an event for ''super people'' - ''people in big business who can appreciate the big business of football.'' **********And for New Orleans, a city that increasingly relies on the tourist business, it is yet another means to attract visitors. For hotel executives, French Quarter businessmen, T-shirt sellers and souvenir shop owners, it is a dream of great riches. City's Pregame Frenzy **********But as the pregame activity worked up to a frenzy in recent weeks - with the usual avalanche of phone calls directed to local residents from long-forgotten acquaintances and relatives seeking tickets, hotel rooms or just a corner to park a sleeping bag - there were signs that the glow from the business side may be a little dimmer at this year's game. **********While the city is expecting ''3,000 private aircraft using three airports and probably some cornfields as well'' for the game this coming Sunday, according to Beverly Gianna of the Greater New Orleans Tourist and Convention Commission, she noted that some of the big corporations that usually descend upon a Super Bowl city in their corporate jets had not made their usual requests for airport service. **********One major airport ground service company, the General Aviation Corporation, reported that corporate bookings were ''considerably less'' than for the last Super Bowl here in 1978. Nick Boroni, assistant vice president, said: ''I'd have to say the economy is playing a role. The thrill riding has been cut to a minimum.'' **********And Joseph Bonomolo of Bonomolo Limousines, which rents Lincoln Continentals equipped with televisions and bars for $40 an hour, said: ''Reservations are down from corporate groups, but the game is sold out, and they've got to come in. We have one client coming in from Frankfurt, Germany.'' **********Super Bowl tickets continue to be eagerly sought at prices far above the National Football League price of $40. The scalpers' market is lively here with tickets selling for as much as $500. **********''Money doesn't mean anything to these people,'' said a New Orleans stockbroker who has sat in on discussions at downtown luncheon clubs centered on tickets and hotel rooms. ''The way to get a suite at a good downtown hotel is to tip an employee $100 a room, $300 for a three-room suite.'' Hotels Fully Booked **********The city's 22,000 hotel rooms are fully booked at the usual prices ($90 and $100 a day at the major hotels) and have been ''for some time,'' said Joseph F. Frederick Jr., president of the Greater New Orleans Hotel and Motel Association and general manager of the New Orleans Hilton. Many hotels require a minimum stay of three days. **********There has been brisk corporate demand for blocks of hotel rooms, Mr. Frederick said. ''A company might reserve anywhere from five to 200 rooms. They use Super Bowl as a means to solidify and enhance their customer relationships and to recruit new customers. It's a great tool for that. They invite people to the game, buy their tickets, pay for their transportation and hotel.'' Such an invitation can cost thousands of dollars a customer, he said, but ''in the long run, it may be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in business.'' **********For the city of New Orleans, the game means anywhere between $40 million and $150 million in business, said John Bender, city public information director. **********''We are ecstatic,'' said Morris H. Auerbach, food and beverage director of the Ogden Foods Service Corporation at the Superdome, who is prepared to supply food and drink to 76,000 fans on Super Bowl Sunday as well as to cater private parties. But he is not sure how many parties there will be. **********''It's like standing-room-only at the opera and they're all hungry, thank God,'' he said. During the 1978 Super Bowl, sales of food and beverages at the Superdome exceeded $500,000. Sales-Incentive Program **********Among companies having parties at the Superdome will be AnheuserBusch Inc., which is planning for a hundred or so people having ''a few beers and some snacks,'' said Robert Berra, the brewer's New Orleans branch manager. Anheuser-Busch traditionally uses the Super Bowl as part of a sales-incentive program for 40 or 50 Anheuser-Busch employees, Mr. Berra said. **********Wembley Industries, the New Orleans-based pie company, is still looking for tickets but has booked hotel rooms in any case for ''24 to 36'' customers from all over the country, said Sam Pulitzer, the company's chairman. **********''A lot of customers say, 'We'll pay you back,' but if they don't we don't worry about it,'' Mr. Pulitzer said. ''We spend hundreds of thousands of dollars each year on advertising, and another $5,000 or $10,000 on the Super Bowl is not significant.'' Wembley has also scheduled a cocktail party and dinner at Antoine's, where not only football but also business is discussed. **********The National Broadcasting Company is throwing a party for 1,000 aboard the steamer President on Saturday on the Mississippi River, with fried catfish and crawfish quiche, among other dishes. **********Barron Hilton, chairman and president of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, who is flying in after the Presidential inauguration in his corporate jet, will be host at a pregame party for 1,200 to 1,400 guests in the grand ballroom at the Hilton. His co-hosts are John W.  Mecom Jr., president of the New Orleans Saints, and Eugene V. Klein, president of the San Diego Chargers. More Than Fun and Games **********Many corporations prefer anonymity. ''Frankly, I guess, like most companies, we are not looking for a lot of publicity about this,'' said an American Cyanamid executive in Wayne, N.J., in a telephone conversation about the company's planned Super Bowl trip. ''It's not just fun and games and shooting off fireworks. We have a business program planned as well.'' **********Ella Brennan, an owner of Commander's Palace Restaurant in the Garden District, said, ''We find we sell our most expensive wines for the Super Bowl - Dom Perignon, the better Bordeaux, Chateau Latour.'' **********Among the first of the Super Bowl parties during bowl season here was one being used to finance the city's new summer festival, La Fete, an attempt to make the city more attractive during its hot, humid July weather. **********The festival backers, designated as contributors of $5,000 and $1,000 each, and an assortment of political figures and celebrities gathered recently in the Hilton Hotel's Napoleon Ballroom. The $5,000 donors receive two free Super Bowl tickets; $1,000 donors receive a chance at a ticket."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/17/business/amc-narrows-losses.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 311, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.M.C.

The next morning they were dead.  Their charred, bullet-ridden bodies were found in a burned rented car on a lonely road. **********Bodies Are Mutilated **********The arms and legs of two of the men were missing and an autopsy found that many of their bones were broken. The Civil Guard agreed to return the body of Mr. Manas to his family on the condition that his coffin not be opened. **********On May 21, Interior Minister Juan Jose Roson gave a parliamentary subcommittee the Government's version of what had happened.  Recalling that on May 7 terrorists belonging to E.T.A., the Basque separatist group, had killed three soldiers in Madrid in an attack on an aide to King Juan Carlos, the Interior Minister blamed the overheated political atmosphere for a ''tragic error.'' After a number of citizens had spotted the youths in Almeria, taking them for terrorists, he said, the Civil Guard detained them. **********They gave evasive answers. Two pistols were found in their car.  Handcuffed, they were being driven to Madrid for questioning when they overpowered the two Civil Guardsmen accompanying them, hurling them from the rented Ford. Legislators Express Disbelief **********Lieut. Col. Carlos Castillo Quero, in another vehicle, ordered his men to fire at the wheels of the Ford. It spilled into a ditch and caught fire, killing the three men. **********Opposition legislators greeted Mr. Roson's version with angry incredulity. How could three handcuffed youths overpower two armed Civil Guardsmen? If the Civil Guardmen fired at the Ford's wheels, why were the bodies riddled with bullets that had been come from various directions? Why had the two pistols not been produced? Why did a plainclothes Civil Guardsman tell a group of people who came upon the burning car that the victims had been removed? **********''Why were these three young men killed if the death penalty does not exist in Spain?'' asked Carlos Sanjuan, a Socialist member of Parliament, challenging the Interior Minister. ''If we don't have a convincing answer I have to think we are before a triple crime, and that the Government is covering up this crime.'' **********Subsequent investigations by lawyers, an investigating magistrate and the press have uncovered more disquieting facts. Colonel Castillo Quero, the Almeria Civil Guard commander, has been hospitalized in the past for ''nervous disequilibrium.'' He was declared ill with a stomach problem the day the three youths died. Other Defects in the Case **********According to informants close to the case, shards of bone were found in the burned car. But there were no signs of smoke inhalation in the dead men's lungs, suggesting that they had been killed before the car caught fire. **********The official version has other defects in it. Mr. Roson said the agency that rented the three men the car had reported them as suspicious to the Civil Guard; the car rental company has denied this. The three men had identity papers and no criminal record, but the Civil Guard maintained that their documentation was faulty. **********The local prosecutor in Almeria has asked that Colonel Castillo Quero and two other Civil Guardsmen be prosecuted for homicide, but the investigating magistrate, Angel Tortosa, has not yet completed what looks like an exhaustive inquiry. A lawyer for the families of the three dead men has praised the judge's meticulous work. **********The available evidence suggests that the three youths were tortured and then murdered - a conclusion that many had reached even when Interior Minister Roson gave his account to Parliament. If Judge Tortosa reaches a similar conclusion, the Government's credibility will have suffered another blow. **********On Feb. 13, Jose Ignacio Arregui, an E.T.A. militant, died in Madrid after being held incommunicado in police custody for 10 days under an antiterrorist statute. His body showed signs of torture, including burns on the soles of his feet. **********Mr. Roson still maintains that Mr. Arregui died of a lung condition.

An Asian diplomatic analyst said he believed that the two sides would start by seeking a framework for dealing with the complex and emotional border issue. The talks will also cover scientific and cultural contacts and trade. **********Late tonight the New China News Agency reported that in today's talks ''the two sides expressed common aspirations for the settlement of the Chinese-Indian border problem and the development of relations between the two countries and reached identical views on procedural matters.'' 'Sincere and Friendly' **********It did not specify how long the talks lasted but said officials of the two nations had split into discussion groups. The atmosphere was described as ''sincere and friendly.'' **********The Chinese have cordially welcomed the Indian delegation, which arrived Monday night. At a banquet here Tuesday, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Han Nianlong, said China was ''very pleased'' about the talks and hoped that ''with our common efforts, our discussion will surely proceed smoothly and our friendly relations will grow.'' **********Eric Gonsalves, the head of the Indian delegation, responded by saying, ''We have no way to go other than forward with our friendly relationship.'' Mr. Gonsalves, who is Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs, had made a preparatory visit here last year. **********In another tentative sign of improving relations, it was announced last week that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had accepted an invitation from Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang to visit China sometime in the future. The invitation, originally extended when Mr. Huang visited New Delhi in June, was renewed when Mr. Zhao met Mrs. Gandhi at the economic conference in Cancun, Mexico, in October. Two Areas at Issue **********The border dispute led to full-scale fighting in 1962. India has accused the Chinese of seizing nearly 14,500 square miles in the Aksai Chin and Ladakh region of their common western frontier. The Chinese in turn have said that India holds about 56,000 square miles of former Chinese territory on their eastern frontier. **********Last year China declared that it was not asking for the return of territory ''illegally incorporated into India by the old colonialists'' and proposed that both nations make concessions by accepting the realities of the present border. India rejected this as acquiescing to China's seizure of its land. **********The root of the dispute is that India adheres to the so-called McMahon line drawn between India and Tibet by the British in 1915, while China bases its claim on a tributary-based ''traditional and conventional'' frontier. **********Because the positions are so entrenched, the decision to negotiate at all is viewed as something of a breakthrough. The Chinese had previously contended that the border dispute was so formidable that both sides should concentrate on other aspects of their relations.  The Indians maintained that no real improvement was possible until the border question was settled. Thaw Began Five Years Ago **********After Chinese troops overran the disputed border region in the west in October 1962, diplomatic ties were virtually frozen until five years ago, when China and India decided to restore ambassadors.  A slow thaw followed. **********In early 1979 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then India's Foreign Minister, visited Peking only to return home prematurely because China had attacked Vietnam, which India supported. Prospects for improving relations were further stalled when Mrs. Gandhi recognized the new Vietnamese-backed regime of Heng Samrin in Cambodia in place of the ousted Pol Pot regime backed by China. **********But last year Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, was quoted as telling an Indian visitor to Peking that he saw no reason why the border problem could not be solved by repeated discussions. In June, when Mr. Huang visited India, he told reporters that he thought that ''a fair, comprehensible and reasonable'' solution could be found. **********The Chinese have since allowed small groups of Indian pilgrims to visit holy sites in Tibet. The overland trade route between India and China remains closed, except for what gets smuggled through Nepal.  Nonetheless, Chinese-Indian trade has grown from virtually nothing two years ago to an estimated $100 million annually, running heavily in India's favor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/28/business/dow-rises-9.18-more-volume-up.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1981-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 659, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VOLUME UP", "print_headline": "DOW RISES 9.18 MORE; VOLUME UP", "body_text": " **********The stock market's ''OPEC rally'' gained momentum yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average sharply higher in stepped-up trading.

Anderson, chairman of the NCR Corporation, says, ''has become so crowded that it's difficult to keep track of all the players without a scorecard.'' **********Yet that did not stop NCR yesterday from announcing its entry into word processing, to be followed next year by other electronic office systems. At virtually the same hour, at a news conference elsewhere in New York, the Data General Corporation, a minicomputer manufacturer, announced that it, too, was entering the office automation market. **********And Data General's announcement follows by less than three weeks nearly simultaneous announcements by two other minicomputer makers, the Digital Equipment Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company, that they, too, would make major thrusts into office automation. **********Indeed, almost all the computer companies, whose products were once kept separately in out-of-the-way rooms, are now trying to get their ''work stations,'' the new name for a computer terminal with a typewriter keyboard and television screen, on every office worker's desk. **********In the products announced by Data General yesterday, such a desktop terminal, when connected to a larger computer, could be used by an office worker for word processing, to send memos to another terminal, to retrieve data from the computer and to quickly plot that data into graphs or charts. The prices range from about $70,000 for a system with eight terminals to as much as $250,000. **********NCR's systems, selling for $7,800 for one desktop station to as much as $100,000 for large systems, are intended for word processing, but the company promised advanced options such as electronic mail in 1982. **********The activity reflects the fact that the business of providing electronic aids to office workers is becoming a big business.  Wordprocessing sales alone, which were about $2 billion in 1980, are expected to reach $5 or $6 billion by 1985. **********It also reflects the fact that the new multi-purpose work stations are starting to combine the functions of a word processor, which have traditionally been thought of as electronic replacements for a typewriter, with some functions of computers, such as storing and processing data. That represents an opportunity for computer makers to expand into word processing. But it also represents a threat that word processing companies will encroach on the turf of the computer companies. **********Some analysts say, in fact, that computer makers are now engaged more in making announcements to prevent their customers from looking to other vendors of word processors than they are in actually selling office automation products.

While large companies like Xerox and Exxon are losing money in office automation and even Digital Equipment has stumbled on its way into the wordprocessing business, the smaller companies, such as the CPT Corporation of Eden Prairie, Minn., and NBI Inc. of Boulder, Colo., that specialize in word processing, are growing at 50 percent a year or more. **********''The industry was supposed to be dominated by a whole different set of companies,'' said Melody Johnson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company. Seeking Wider Market **********One reason for that, analysts say, is that while integrated word and data processing systems are the wave of the future, right now most companies looking to automate their office functions are content merely to replace typewriters with word processors. That is easier to conceive and much cheaper than rewiring the whole office so that everyone is electronically connected to everyone else. **********Another pitfall is that computer companies that have traditionally sold to data-processing experts have had trouble selling directly to non-technical office managers. **********''The whole reason the word-processing business exists is that the computer people don't understand the office,'' said Dean F. Scheff, chairman of CPT. Mr. Garrett of Paine Webber agreed. ''The products being offered by the computer companies promise all things to all people at all times, but they don't know how to sell it and the customers don't know how to use them,'' he said. Expanding Product Lines **********Meanwhile, other companies with a head start in the market are busily expanding their product lines. **********Yesterday, the Xerox Corporation, which already offers word processors and other products, announced a new series of electronic typewriters, with a base price of $1,430. **********On Monday, the Datapoint Corporation announced new printers, facsimile and graphics systems. Wang Laboratories, one of the leaders in word processing, announced a whole new line of products this month, as did the Exxon Corporation, which has so far been a failure in the business. Anticipating the Market **********Although most companies are cautious about automating their offices beyond word processing, the computer manufacturers insist that the market will develop. '' We don't know when it's going to happen, but we know we have to be there when it happens,'' said Mr. Anderson of NCR. **********The Dayton, Ohio, computer company is, in fact, stressing integrating various office systems and is not even manufacturing some of the products it will sell. The desktop terminal announced yesterday is made by Convergent Technologies, a West Coast company, and the printers by Nippon Electric Company of Japan. And NCR is recruiting a new sales force to sell its office products. **********As the marketing approach shifts to combining word processing and data processing, the computer companies will have an advantage.  Since thousands of companies already have computers in place, adding the extras for office automation would be less expensive than buying a completely separate office automation system. Building a Network **********However, word-processing companies, even if they do not provide complete systems, will be able to connect their systems with communications networks and computers made by others. ''I'm not sure every company that's in the business needs to provide all the pieces,'' said Thomas S. Kavanagh, president of NBI. **********While each company says its products are unique and better than the rest, many of them seem similar in purpose. In addition to word processing, which is designed for secretaries, the companies are trying to entice managers and even top executives to put terminals on their desks by offering these features: **********- Electronic mail, which would allow messages to be sent from one desk to another and perhaps to other locations. **********- Electronic calendars, in which the computer can help find times when a group of people in the office are free for meetings. **********- Electronic filing, which allows documents to be stored in a computer and retrieved. **********- Systems which allow office workers to retrieve data from their company's computers with simple commands. **********- Graphics programs, so the data can quickly be displayed as graphs or charts. **********- Local networks, which use a cable or wires to tie all the equipment together and to connect it to printers or copiers.  In the future, voice messages, which are now handled by a separate telephone system, might be combined with the network, as will be the capability to transmit and store images and video. Some office equipment companies are already moving in that direction. And all companies are emphasizing that their products are easy to use by people with no computer experience."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/21/business/key-rates-049518.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/16/business/arco-to-spend-27.6-billion.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arco to Spend $27.6 Billion", "print_headline": "Arco to Spend $27.6 Billion", "body_text": " **********The Atlantic Richfield Company said it will spend $27.6 billion on capital projects between 1982 and 1986, mostly for exploration and development of domestic energy sources. **********Under its five-year capital program, Arco said, more than $4 billion will be spent on the development of the Kuparuk and Prudhoe Bay oilfields in Alaska, and another $2 billion will be spent on exploratory work in that state. **********In all, nearly $19 billion will be spent on exploration and development of oil in gas in the United States, the Los Angeles-based company said. **********About $1.3 billion will be put into expan ding the company's worldwide coa l operations, Arco said.

Even though candidate Reagan campaigned on a platform calling for immediate decontrol of natural gas prices, it is becoming more and more likely that President Reagan will not ask Congress to vote on the issue.  Instead, he will probably embark on what some have called ''the backdoor approach'' to decontrol, an approach that requires no legislated change in the current law, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. **********Through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which administers the gas act, the Administration can raise the average price for all gas by allowing dramatic increases in the price for certain categories of gas. It was precisely this path that David Stockman laid out to a gas industry meeting before he became director of the Office of Management and Budget. **********''There's a lot of discretion available to the commission (in) devising additional categories of high-cost or incentive gas that could for all practical purposes be deregulated,'' Mr. Stockman said. Moreover, in the opinion of Danny Boggs, the chief of the transition team for the energy commission who is now a White House aide, the commission can even raise the price of gas flowing under old (pre-1977) contracts. **********Such views make the natural gas industry analysts on Wall Street very, very bullish. ''The Reagan Administration's most realistic option is to provide incentive pricing,'' says one of their reports, ''for categories where it is needed - through the F.E.R.C. as provided in the N.G.P.A. We believe this approach can achieve many of the same results as can accelerated decontrol, and yet avoid many of the (political) risks associated with the latter.'' **********For President Reagan, the advantages of administrative, or backdoor decontrol are straightforward: *********** No bitter battle in Congress to arouse public outrage; *********** The opportunity for Congressional allies to deny responsibility for their constituents' suddenly higher natural gas bills; *********** The transfer of the gas pricing issue from a highly charged arena closely watched by the media to a complex and leaden regulatory process understood by few and ignored by most; *********** The chance to take credit for protecting the economy while actually damaging it; *********** And finally, pacifying the gas industry by providing producers with decontrolled prices for ''new'' gas and pipeline and distribution companies with price controls on ''old'' gas. **********The cost to America's economy, however, will be devastating. The continuation of strict price controls through 1985 would increase average gas prices by at least 20 percent yearly, but the accelerated approach would impose a whopping 50 percent yearly. **********For the average worker, whose earnings have already been eaten up by higher energy bills, decontrol means he would have to work three weeks instead of one week to pay for the gas he uses in his home. **********American industry, which consumes 40 percent of the nation's gas, would be hit for as much as $234 billion between now and 1985. This compares with $34 billion for the period 1976-1980. **********Producers and Administration officials continue to publicize the myth that decontrol will increase drilling and production, and that producers will choose to invest in oil rather than gas, if gas prices are not raised to the artificially high levels imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. **********But the facts - namely, the amount of money actually invested in oil and gas exploration and development - reveal a very different picture. According to Bureau of Census data, between 1974 and 1978, oil and gas producers invested more money in gas exploration and development than in oil exploration and development. **********THIS was so despite the fact that natural regulated gas prices were far lower than oil prices. Why? Mainly, because the actual cost of producing gas is one-third the cost of producing oil - all of which means that profits in every dollar invested have been greater for gas than for oil. **********The energy commission will probably attempt to accelerate decontrol by changing the rules governing the prices for various categories of gas. A number of consuming states, consumer and industry groups are challenging these rulings in commission proceedings and in the courts. If these challenges fail, the commission would be in a position to undermine the entire price control mechanism of the gas act. The commission would be able to create so many ''incentive'' categories of gas that producers would only drill for gas within those categories and leave the low-priced (although easily produced) gas for sometime in the future when gas is decontrolled. **********Even though, in the short run, it is less costly to the economy than immediate decontrol, backdoor, or accelerated decontrol is really more disturbing, because it is an effort by the Reagan Administration to get total decontrol without arousing public indignation and political retribution. It is decontrol by attrition, rather than by all-out war. The end result is the same. OPEC and the international oil companies will set a cartel price for the inexpensive gas produced in America."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/15/world/food-is-stake-in-somalia-s-refugee-numbers-game.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1981-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOOD IS STAKE IN SOMALIA'S REFUGEE NUMBERS GAME", "print_headline": "FOOD IS STAKE IN SOMALIA'S REFUGEE NUMBERS GAME", "body_text": " **********There are 15,000 people here - or 68,000. The higher figure is the official estimate of the Somali Government, the lower was provided by some of those running this refugee camp. **********Those who made the lower assessment requested anonymity since, they said, the Government is deeply sensitive about this sad numbers game, which has become a controversy throughout Somalia. Qoryoley lies about 80 miles southwest of Mogadishu, the Somali capital. It is, possibly, the least harrowing of the 35 refugee camps in Somalia, the world's eighth poorest country. Malnutrition affects only 6 percent of the people, compared with 30 percent elsewhere. It lies hard by the Shebeli River in Somalia's slim green belt; plant tomatoes here, relief workers say, and you'll get a record crop. **********Yet the camp also yields insights into some of the problems besetting the huge relief operation by Western countries, voluntary organizations and international agencies in Somalia. Relief goods are diverted away from refugees and the visitor can see American wheat, stacked for sale in tin-roofed stores. Tuberculosis haunts the beaten-earth pathways and gray, thatched homes of the camp; there are tribal tensions, and the place has become a permanent settlement of outsiders in a country where the indigenous population is fast outstripping the resources of an economy that depends on exporting camels, goats and bananas and on foreign aid. 'The Hottest Issue' **********''The hottest issue at the moment is the numbers,'' said an official of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Mogadishu. The Government estimate for the total number of refugees in Somalia is 1.3 million. Western estimates range between 300,000 and 600,000. The United Nations decided recently on a planning figure of 650,000. **********Word of the estimate incensed the Government of President Mohammed Siad Barre. A United Nations demographer took a sampling earlier this year and reportedly came up with a figure of 450,000 to 600,000.  That, too, left Mogadishu affronted and the demographer's report was not published. **********Two new experts arrived in town recently, one Norwegian and one Frenchman, to take a fresh sample. Ahmed Yassin, the deputy head of Somalia's national refugee commission, said the Government favored a full census of the camps and would abide by its outcome. But that will take too long for Western planners, who favor a statistical sampling, by head-count or by aerial photography. The debate may seem dry and hard on those who have lost their lands and fathers and husbands and who hold out empty hands for food. It does cut, however, to the quick of Somalia's relationship with and dependency on its donors. **********''Fo od is f oreign exchange for the Government,'' a United Nations official said . The higher the refugee count, the more food comes in and the less Somalia's tired resources are strained. As it is, Somalia's foo d exports and production have been falling while its imports have been rising a nd now, Western economists say, the nation of four million people - 80 per cent of them subsistence f armers or nomadic herders -imports half its own food needs, much of it in aid. **********American aid to Somalia last year totalled $90 million. Two thirds of that went to the refugees. For the West, there is a prospect of a costly, open-ended commitment to Somalia and its refugees because the forces driving them here have not been removed, despite Western efforts to promote better relations between Somalia and neighboring Ethiopia. The fugitives came, initially, to escape the war between these two countries over the Ogaden region in 1977 and 1978. **********Formallly, the hostilities have ended. Unofficially, the war simmers, with bombing raids along the disputed border by Ethiopian forces and guerrilla attacks against Ethiopia by the Somali-backed Western Somali Liberation Front. Both the guerrillas and the Somalis seek to end Ethiopian control of the Ogaden, an area populated by ethnic Somalis and claimed by Somalia. **********The heat seems to have gone out of the fighting since the time when refugees were arriving at a rate of 1,200 per day, their camels heaped high with skins and poles to build tented homes away from the fighting. Now, the figure of new arrivals if 50 to 100 per day while others, Western officials say, are returning to their homes because a drought has broken. ''It is still a massive problem,'' a relief worker said, ''but not the dire emergency it once was.'' **********Food is reaching most of the refugees most of the time, United Nations officials say, though worries persist about the protein adequacy of the diet, and Western agencies are seeking tighter regulatory systems to control the flow of aid, beginning with the proposed head-count. The American group, CARE, has set up a Government-supported monitoring unit that is intended to prevent food intended for the refugees from going astray into commercial markets and elsewhere. ''Certainly there is some diversion involving officials in the distribution system,'' one of those monitoring officials said. American Badly Beaten **********He requested, however, that his name be withheld because, he said, an American in one camp came too close to exposing racketeers recently and was beaten so savagely that he was hospitalized in the United States. **********Officially, the Government does not wish these refugee settlements to become permanent places. Somalia's own population is growing at a rate of 2.6 percent a year, yet its food production has not kept pace, and the country is running out of usable land. The corn crop in 1970, for instance, was 122,000 tons. Last year it was 110,000 ton.  Yet refugees are settling, presenting a long-term problem. ''This is here to stay. This is a new city,'' said an American here, gesturing with a sweep of his arm around Qoryoley camp, which looks more like an established village than a place of transition. **********''These people won't go home until there's a settlement in the Ogaden and that doesn't seem likely for some time,'' the relief offical said. ''So now we have to start them on development projects with tractors and cultivation and so forth.'' That smacks of permanency and presents its own problems. **********There are few men here, because most are either dead or out fighting the forgotten war in the Ogaden or, in some camps, out herding cattle and livestock. Of all the refugees in Somalia, the United Nations says, only 10 percent are men. Those that are here, the relief workers say, are sometimes too proud for humble tillage.  Some, the workers assert, are Western Somali Liberation Front guerrillas, resting nearby in a private area reserved for ''warriors'' outside the camp's limits, a reminder of the conflict that brought the refugees here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/16/business/gasoline-stocks-at-high-levels.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gasoline Stocks At High Levels", "print_headline": "Gasoline Stocks At High Levels", "body_text": " **********The stockpile of gasoline at American refineries is fast approaching a record inventory that may cause slowdowns or shutdowns of the facilities and could eventually restrain gasoline price increases, an oil industry expert said today. **********Consumer conservation of gasoline and continued production of fuel oil for winter heating, which results automatically in production of large amounts of gasoline, were combining to create stocks of 277 million barrels of gasoline at refineries, in pipelines and at large terminals throughout the country, according to the Lundberg Letter, an oil industry publication. **********''What the refineries are going to do with it, I don't know,'' said Dan Lundberg, author of the publication.

It started making a profit after 30 months and, economy or no, is celebrating November as the hottest month in its history following the best first half in its history. Ad pages for November are up 22.8 percent from a year ago, to 258, while revenues soared 45.3 percent, to more than $2 million. **********For 1981, the publisher expects to gross $17 million, a 20 percent increase in revenues, and hit 1,593 advertising pages, a 7.8 percent improvement over 1980. **********In 1976, Mr. Keefe recalls asking himself what the growth industries were as far as his future advertisers were concerned and decided they were information management, office equipment and office furniture. And that plus some corporate advertising is pretty much what the magazine is getting. **********''We are a classic study of taking a very sophisticated marketing approach to positioning a publication and staying with it,'' Mr.  Keefe said, explaining that when his magazine was started the only magazine around for the general industrial audience was the Manufacturing edition of Fortune. ''We are the magazine for the wealth creators of America,'' he added. **********Industry Week magazine started with 130,000 controlled, or free, circulation sent to top and middle management in manufacturing companies. The company knows who to mail a publication to because starting in 1933 Penton began developing a census of manufacturers, investing an estimated $27 million in it over the years, until today it has data on every plant employing 20 or more people. **********Now the circulation is at 300,000 and copies are going to 96,000 facilities operated by 24,000 companies that employ 100 or more persons and represent 76 percent of the gross national product.

Mr. Keefe thinks of the whole package as a ''survival kit for executives.'' **********''By serving the reader first, you serve the advertiser best,'' Mr. Keefe said.  Who are those readers?  Well, they are more than 82 percent male, more than 53 percent managers and professionals, 64 percent of them are between 25 and 49 years of age and almost that many are in households with $25,000 a year income. In all cases, according to Industry Week promotion data, the magazine has higher percentages than the three major competitors. **********But the publisher is pretty pleased with the publication's niche.

Chip manufacturers say it is hard even for them to raise the money needed to invest in new equipment to keep up with rapid changes in technology. At the same time, semiconductor prices are falling, biting sharply into earnings. **********The makers of the tiny chips, which form the heart of modern computers, are banding together to seek tax incentives from Washington to encourage capital formation and research and development. They contend most proposals now being considered are geared toward older industries, and are ill-suited for the rapidly changing high-technology companies. **********Last week three executives of leading concerns in California's socalled Silicon Valley talked with reporters and editors of The New York Times about the industry's problems and prospects. The executives were Robert N. Noyce, vice chairman of the Intel Corporation, W.J. Sanders 3d, president and chairman of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and John L. Nesheim, treasurer of the National Semiconductor Corporation. **********Q. What are you seeking from the Government? **********NOYCE: The problem that we see is that there is relatively little recognition yet of the importance of this new technology and where it's going to take us as a society. And it is the emerging importance of that that we believe needs to get a lot more attention. I just did a conference in London where I found one very, very interesting thing - The Minister of Industry also bears the title of Minister of Information Technology. **********In general, we feel that our Government's policies in this area have been overly weighted to the mature industries and underrepresenting the new growth industries. **********NESHEIM: Our industry looks at capital formation as its fundamental objective. John Kennedy said there are three ways to win an election: money, money and more money. You pump cash flow into brains, and you're eventually going to win. It's the staying power of raising capital that is the key. **********We view research and development just like investments in factories. Both are long-term investments, both depreciate very rapidly because of movements in technology. In the Reagan economic package, the main error is that they have forgotten about incentives for research and development and have assumed that by putting the cash flow incentive into equipment instead of ideas that they have solved the problem. **********Q. Are you also saying that losing the edge in technology has strategic implications? **********NESHEIM: It has an interesting implication. When a foot soldier has a mostly electronics hand-held weapon that costs $6,000 and has a 90 percent probability of destroying a $2.5 million NATO tank, that says we can fight iron technology with electronics very efficiently. **********If we lose the technology, we will have to cover two supply routes to and from Japan in the next war. And then wait until the military men open up the black boxes operating the MX missile system and all the semiconductors say, ''Made in Japan.'' That's the strategic problem we're facing. **********Q. If you got your tax breaks, where would you be putting your investment money? Are there particular problems you view as threshold technological problems that will be neglected unless you get this break? **********NOYCE: If you look at the man years per product in designing software, it's going up exponentially now, and we need to control that expansion of required manpower. The whole software area is one that is grossly inadequate. We have to find better ways to do it.We're moving in another area from higher power devices to lower power devices. **********Most of this is a question of the rate of development. You cannot do one thing and that be enough. You've got to push this front pretty broadly. It's no longer a spearhead sort of thing. **********Q. To what extent does the American industry have the advantage of a superior product over foreign competitors? **********SANDERS: All the Japanese manufacturers of microcomputers use American microprocessors. So at the leading edge of technology, there's no question of American superiority. There is no Japanese originated, conceived and designed microprocessor. They're all American. The fact that they may later become socket stealers and replicate these designs certainly is possible. But there's no doubt that the entire driving force behind the computer explosion has been American technology and still is. **********Q. The Japanese have been producing a product that has a much lower reject rate than the American manufacturers. Are we catching up? **********SANDERS: Quality means conformance to specification. And a lot of people have extrapolated that to mean that somebody's product is better. That is not what quality means. Our products were never worse than the Japanese. The only question was what percentage of the product being shipped was rejected. For the Japanese it might have been, for example, three-tenths of 1 percent, whereas maybe Ameican industry was 1 percent. **********On an absolute basis there's no question that they then had higher quality. That's two years ago, and that's a dead issue. Today, American companies, being the responsive companies we are, meet the market challenge. It's no longer an issue, and any customer that you talk to will tell you there's now no material difference between the best Japanese supplier and the best American supplier. **********Q. Let's talk a little bit about business conditions. We've heard a lot about price weakness. Where do things now stand? **********NOYCE: Right now, there's an excess capacity. I think the industry this time has made very firm decisions not to do what they did in 1975. In other words, we decided to absolutely keep the R.& D. going, to keep the market development going, to keep the process development going and take the lumps on the bottom line. **********SANDERS: This is kind of an interesting recession for our industry because it's basically a price recession, if you will. The units shipped are still up. Now, if the units are up and the prices are down, such that you have flat sales, that will put some temporary discomfort on the profit margins. But the truth is, never have more units been consumed than today. So this proves our historic theory of price elasticity. With these prices, for example on memory, coming down as far as they have, although it may cause us some short-term perturbations, the bigger perturbation is that we need more volume. **********Q. What time frame are you talking about? **********SANDERS: Our estimate is that 1981 will be a rather boring year, that in 1982 business will be much stronger. And we think there's no reason to go out of our historical quadrennial cycle where three years from now we'll be talking about inadequate capacity, long lead times, people in the computer and communications businesses saying that they can't ship systems because they can't get components. **********In reality, all we have going on right now is the unit demand is up but not up enough to offset the price attritions. Memory is, for all intents and purposes, free. If you look at what we're charging for microprocessor chips, for all intents and purposes, they're free. **********Q. You mentioned that you're going to keep spending and keep your people working and take the lumps on the bottom line. How bad are those lumps going to be? Do you think any companies will see losses in the quarter? **********NOYCE: I don't think they will. I have not seen any yet, but we haven't seen all the results yet either.  SANDERS: We don't see any losses. I think we see lots of pressure.  Q. In terms of products, is the industry maturing? Are you now somewhat like the steel industry where the major innovations have been made and now you're just refining things, or are there major new thresholds to cross? **********NOYCE: From the technological point of view, we are far from the fundamental limits. We can probably go to 1,000 times the complexity that we're at today. The question is: Who can use that intelligence? **********In other words, by a decade or two decades from now you'll be able to put into something that costs, let us say $20 or $30, the most complex system that has ever been built today. That is where the technology is going. What will you use it for, that's the question. **********Q. One of the characteristics of your industry is the way companies come and go. Who are the next Advanced Micro Devices and Intels? **********SANDERS: There's no question there are a lot of niche markets which are great opportunies, where entrepreneurially oriented companies will get started and will build a $50 million or maybe even a $100 million business. **********But if you look at how much it costs to be in the business, to be a major factor, just to stay abreast of the technology, there is not likely to be another A.M.D. or another Intel. **********NOYCE: I see the opportunity now for applications of this technology. And I think that there's a good chance that you'll have major new companies. You'll have the Apples of the world. **********We sat around, we had all of the capabilities to do that job (in personal computers) and we said, ''It's not going to be an interesting market, so we'll neglect it.'' It was a gross error on our part, but that's what we did. **********I think it's interesting to note that, in spite of the real damage done by defecting groups, that the electronics association in general has done everything to encourage those defections. **********Q. Then why is Intel suing Seeq Technology Inc., which is a company that broke off from it, while Intel itself broke off from Fairchild Camera and Instrument? **********NOYCE: We think there's a question of ethics involved here as to whether the venture capitalist should go into an existing company with the technology and try to drag that out, or whether they should wait for the people to come to the venture capitalist and say, ''We want to leave. Would you finance us?'' **********Q. Are you saying the venture capitalists are going in and plucking people out of companies? **********SANDERS: Right now there's a mountain of money out there. In 1979 alone, $900 million flooded into venture capital. I know of at least three or four groups now that are taking their little dog and pony show around which will raise another $100 million from various foreign investors to set up new venture capital pools. So now you've got the funds looking for the talent as opposed to the talent looking for the funds, and I think there are going to be some excesses. In 1975, nobody was suing anybody. There was only $10 million of venture capital available. **********Q. There seem to be increasing calls in the industry, first by Control Data and then by National Semiconductor, that competitors like yourselves get together for joint research ventures. What do you think of that idea? **********NESHEIM: You end up with a concept of basically getting more mileage per dollar of R.& D. How do you do that? One way is to avoid duplication. In our industry, with $50 million required just to build one production line for the latest equipment, can those that have dedicated internal manufacturing, such as the medium-sized companies, afford to try to continue to do internal semiconductor work? **********NOYCE: If we are looking at joint research, where I think it should be open and it will be in the most part open, then we have the problem that XYZ Company sits here and says, ''Well, gee, I can get all the benefit of that without putting the money in.'' That is going to be a very difficult problem to get by in cooperative research."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/21/business/wednesday-january-21-1981-the-new-administration.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 676, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The New Administration", "print_headline": "WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 21, 1981; The New Administration", "body_text": " **********President Reagan reiterated his campaign promises to take bold and immediate actions to remedy the nation's ''economic afflictions.''

It also demanded regional television exposure for the leader of the Lodz local. **********At the office of Trybuna Ludu, the party daily, an editor said 150,000 copies - on better newsprint than usual but with printing defects - had been printed compared with the usual 1.1 million. **********''In spite of the aims of the organizers of this action,'' said a commentary in the trimmed-down, four-page daily, ''these are not days without Trybuna Ludu.'' **********Finding copies of either Trybuna Ludu or Zolnierz Wolnosci, the army daily, was a challenge.

A front-page editorial in the army newspaper said: ''Who gave Solidarity the right to cut off the links between millions of readers and their national and local dailies?''

Rebel Role Is Demanded **********At first glance, Mr. Shahi's statement appeared to be a retreat from Pakistan's earlier position that it would not talk to representatives of the Soviet-installed Kabul regime since such contact would imply recognition. **********But Mr. Shahi made it clear that what he sought was a meeting in which Pakistani and Iranian delegations would represent their Governments while the group from Kabul would speak only for the ruling party of President Babrak Karmal. Some diplomats from Islamic countries said that Mr. Shahi had insisted that rebel groups involved in the struggle against the Soviet-supported Kabul Government also participate. **********The diplomats acknowledged that it was unlikely that such demands would be accepted by the Afghans or by the Russians, who at the very least are consulting closely on Afghan foreign policy if not framing it. **********But they said that Pakistan's willingness to meet with the Afghans as a political party was new and that it was being projected as a concession and a signal. Minister Accepts Proposal **********The Afghan response to Mr. Shahi was issued here by Dr. Anahita Ratibzad, the Afghan Minister of Education and a confidante of President Karmal. During a meeting with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Dr. Ratibzad reportedly said that her Government was willing to discuss outstanding problems with Iran and Pakistan under the auspices of the United Nations, or at least with the participation of United Nations observers. **********This announcement, on its face, indicated appreciable movement from earlier Afghan positions. Since the overwhelming General Assembly vote to condemn the Soviet intervention, the Kabul regime has been wary of the United Nations and also of regional and Islamic groups.  It has clung instead to a proposal for direct talks with Pakistan and Iran proposed by Mr. Karmal on May 14. Implicit in this view was the notion that the participants would affirm sovereign legitimacy of their neighbors. **********This earlier Afghan and Soviet position also implied the promise of some sort of phased Russian withdrawal and implied also that Iran would thwart infiltration of guerrillas into Afghanistan and prevent the arming of Islamic rebels. Pakistan Shuns Direct Contacts **********Pakistan has insisted that sealing its long mountainous border with Afghanistan is physically impossible and it has shunned direct contacts, seeking to have discussions carried out within the framework of the 44-nation Islamic Conference. **********Mr. Shahi now seems to be opening the door to having the United Nations play the role he had earlier hoped to secure for the Islamic group, and Afghanistan so far has not slammed it shut."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/15/business/harvester-salaries-cut-by-20.html": {"writer_name": "Winston Williams", "pub_date": "1981-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 241, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Harvester Salaries Cut By 20%", "print_headline": "Harvester Salaries Cut By 20%", "body_text": " **********The International Harvester Corporation announced a 20 percent pay reduction today for each of its 26 corporate officers and said the salaries of 30,000 managerial, professional and other white-collar workers would be frozen for an indefinite period. **********A Harvester spokesman said the company did not know how much the pay reductions and the freeze, which are retroactive to Jan. 1, would save the company. **********Analysts have said that weak markets for Harvester's products - trucks, farm equipment and construction equipment - and high interest rates could force the company into stringent cash conservation measures this year.

Several institutions, including the Chase Manhattan Bank, said they would lift their prime to 20 percent effective today. **********Nevertheless, in the credit markets both short-and long-term interest rates declined substantially yesterday, a signal to some economists that interest rates may have peaked. **********Prime Usually Lags Behind **********New three-month Treasury bills, for example, were sold at a yield of 16.03 percent, down nearly half a percentage point from last week's auction. The prime rate usually lags behind interest rates in the money markets. **********''Our forecast is that this is about it; we have probably seen all of the increase we are going to see,'' said Edward Boss, vice president and economist at Continental Illinois Bank in Chicago, another bank that raised its prime to 20 percent. **********The prime reached a record 21 1/2 percent last December and then dropped to 17 percent in early April, reflecting declines in other interest rates. But then, just as quickly, the prime bounced back up, hitting 19 1/2 percent a week ago. Linked to Many Other Rates **********The prime is the announced rate that banks charge on short-term loans to their best corporate customers, although many large corporations obtain short-term loans at rates below the prime. The prime is particularly important, nevertheless, because many other interest rates are tied to it. **********Bankers and credit analysts, many of whom had been caught by surprise at the sudden resurgence in interest rates, are split on their future course. Some see underlying economic trends remaining strong, preventing any immediate turnaround in rates. Others, however, look for money supply growth to slow, allowing the Fed to relax its upward pressure on rates. **********''I expect we are close to the peak in this particular phase,'' predicted Leif H. Olsen, chairman of the economic policy committee at Citibank. ''This increase in interest rates has really been the result of monetary policy in the short run overshooting the targets, and the markets reacting. Unfortunately, once the process begins, it takes awhile to corral it.'' **********But Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, one of the banks that raised its prime yesterday, is somewhat more cautious in his predictions. ''As long as loan demand pressure continues strong, we could see further upward movement,'' he said, noting that commercial and industrial loans at major reporting banks had soared by $4.6 billion since mid-March, for an annual growth rate of 22 percent. But, Mr. Robertson added in a telephone interview yesterday, ''when it comes to the prime, a lot depends on short-term money market rates, which are off today.'' **********Mr. Boss of Continental Illinois acknowledged that the Federal Reserve Board had given no indication yet of backing away from its high interest rate strategy. The rate that banks pay for overnight money remained fairly steady around the 18 1/2 percent level yesterday. But, Mr. Boss said, ''We still feel the economy is weakening, and that will result in slower growth in the money supply.'' Bankers Not Alone **********Bankers are not alone in looking for rates to come down. In Washington, the Reagan Administration has said that lower interest rates will be the first signal that the new economic program has begun to take hold, bringing down inflation. There has been some concern, therefore, over the Fed's role in pushing rates upward in recent weeks. **********Yesterday morning, the Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, met with President Reagan, on what the White House called topics of general economic policy. Although the Administration declined to elaborate on the talks, the Deputy White House press secretary, Larry Speakes, said afterward that the Administration still looked for its economic program to reduce interest rates, making it unncessary for the Fed to raise short-term rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/18/business/newhall-land-farming-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-may-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEWHALL LAND & FARMING CO reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "print_headline": "NEWHALL LAND & FARMING CO reports earnings for Qtr to May 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/03/business/executive-changes-217338.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 414, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** American Cyanamid Company, Wayne, N.J., has named William L.

More importantly, the stock market often strikes a cautionary tone on Fridays in advance of the weekly release of money-supply figures after trading closes on the Big Board.

The latest drop raised expectations that interest rates would continue to decline next week. **********Bank stocks displayed fractional price changes, following strong gains on Thursday, when 16 bank issues on the Big Board traded at their highest prices for at least a year.

Financial Activity Reported **********Texaco is understood to be putting the finishing touches on a loan of more than $3 billion that, according to bankers, would be part of the amount needed to make an offer to buy Cities Service. **********Wall Street sources said persistent reports linked Texaco with Conoco.  Only 48 hours earlier, in what would, if completed, be the biggest corporate merger on record, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company reached agreement to buy Conoco for $7.3 billion in cash and stock, a price calculated at the time the deal was concluded. **********Du Pont's $87.50-a-share bid for 100 percent of Conoco won out over a $73 offer by the Seagram Company for 40 percent and a still-secret offer at $85 a share.

It has since refused further comment. **********Should Texaco be considering a bid for either company, analysts said, there is no reason that either would yet have to know that a takeover was even in prospect. **********''Texaco has the funds for either deal,'' one Wall Street professional remarked.

Companies are discovering they cannot hire the executive they want to hire, and many are being forced to limit their search to a particular geographical area, Mr. Koller said. **********The most common way that companies try to ease the financial strain of moving is to offer executives a ''mortgage interest differential'' payment that compensates for the the difference between the individual's old low-rate mortgage and the new higher-rate loan. But this is not an unlimited subsidy. **********In the past, the typical mortgage differential was allowed for a maximum of three years and was usually graduated downward, from the full difference the first year to perhaps 50 percent by the third year. Now many employers are being forced to extend the differential for a year or two or face employee resentment. **********Daniel A. Picard, managing director of Lamalie Associates, notes that more companies are now paying the full differential for the first three years and only decreasing the subsidy in the fourth and fifth years. When the subsidy finally ends, however, the employee could face the same high-rate problem he did originally, and then he has to meet the higher mortgage costs alone. **********Stephanie Pinson, the new relocation specialist at Gilbert Tweed Associates, a New York executive recruiter, gives an example of just how large the combination of higher interest rates and higher house costs - despite a generous differential - can be for an $80,000-ayear executive who is transferred from New York to California, where house prices are still well above those most everywhere else. **********Assume the executive has a 9 percent mortgage with $75,000 still outstanding. His bank payments, for principal and interest but not for real estate taxes, come to $603 a month. He sells the house for $200,000. **********To buy an equivalent one in Los Angeles, in a neighborhood roughly similar to the one he left, he would have to pay $350,000, according to Mrs. Pinson. He would put up his $125,000 equity from the sale of the New York house, so he would then have to he take out a $225,000 mortgage. He might get a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 16 percent.  The monthly payments, not including taxes and before any differential, would be $3,025, or $2,422 more than he had been paying in New York. **********To ease that burden the executive's company agrees to pay a sevenpoint differential (the difference between the old and the new mortgage rates) on the $75,000 balance that was outstanding on his old mortgage for three years. That works out to a total of $15,750, or $438 a month. So the executive's added cost of housing at the new location is nearly $2,000 a month, or more than $70,000 for the first three years. **********''The real chiller,'' Mrs. Pinson said, is that even with the differential, the executive would probably not even qualify for a mortgage to buy a house like the one he left. Using a rule of thumb that limits payments to no more than 28 percent of monthly gross income, the $80,000 executive could handle monthly payments of only $1,867. **********Of course, the picture would change considerably if the executive were moving from Los Angeles to New York or some other city. In such a case, there probably would not be a need to take out a mortgage. **********Because of the economics of the New York to Los Angeles move, for example, most companies would be almost forced to offer additional financial inducements to persuade the executive to transfer, Mrs.  Pinson said. These might include a substantial raise and a no- or low-interest loan for a big chunk of the new mortgage, or reducing the interest rate on the new mortgage by paying the bank five to 10 ''points'' (a point is equivalent to 1 percent of the face value of the loan and represents prepaid interest). ''How much the company gives depends on how much the guy wants the job, and how much the company wants the guy,'' Mrs. Pinson said. ''There are no rules.'' **********For this reason, Mr. Picard of Lamalie Associates, urges executives to work out the housing costs before accepting a transfer and to bargain hard before packing their bags. ''Your only leverage is before you're there, and that's why it's so critical to have an upfront agreement,'' he said. **********Among other things, the agreement should contain a ''settling-in'' allowance, equivalent to one- to three-months' salary, to cover the one-time costs of moving, such as hooking up utilities and appliances. It might also require the company to pay the duplicate costs of carrying two dwellings for a specified period of time, usually just 30 days but sometimes as long as two or three months. **********B ECAUSE of difficulties in unloading houses in the current sluggish housing market, many large companies turn to firms like Merrill Lynch Relocation Management to handle the deal. But even Merrill Lynch, which guarantees executives the market value of their homes, is having trouble selling residential property these days. **********Patricia Matteson, marketing director for Merrill Lynch Relocation, says it takes the firm five months to sell the average house, up from three and a half months a year ago. And she expects the selling time to stretch out to six months this winter. The firm is now carrying an inventory of 10,000 houses, double the level of a year ago, she added. **********Another approach favored by some companies is to offer a broader cost-of-living adjustment based on overall costs in the new area, according to Runzheimer & Company, a Rochester, Wis., consulting firm. The adjustment typically covers such costs as transportation, real estate taxes, homeowners insurance, utilities, home maintenance and Federal, state and local income taxes. **********The index provides a more accurate gauge of an executive's new living costs than a mortgage differential alone, according to Gaylord Milbrandt, head of Runzheimer's living cost division. He added that the impact of high mortgage interest payments may be overstated because the payments are tax-deductible, while the advantage of living in a state with no income tax may be overrated because money that is not taxed by the state is then taxed by the Federal Government at progressive rates. **********''Chances are the impact of higher housing costs might not be as great as one might expect because of the tax effect,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/world/no-headline-180438.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 843, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********IRANIANS URGED TO BE ALERT FOR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY **********TEHERAN, Iran, July 2 (Reuters) - Iran's leaders, seeking to prevent further violent attacks on prominent Iranians, declared today that it was the duty of all people to be alert and inform the authorities immediately of any suspicious activities. **********''From now on,'' Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said in a speech, ''all of you are members of the intelligence organization.'' A similar request for information on what people might be saying in buses, public places and even doctors' offices was made by the newspaper of the ruling Islamic Republican Party, whose headquarters was wrecked last Sunday by a bomb explosion that killed 72 leading members. **********The newspaper, Jomhuri-i-Islami, also called on both the Iranian people and the authorities to ''bring under their severe control the activities of foreign journalists.'' **********Quick Report by BBC Noted **********The paper recalled that it had long warned that ''reporters of the foreign press are spies.'' It stressed that the British Broadcasting Corporation had obtained information on the bomb blast within five minutes after it occurred. **********The Teheran radio said that seven more leftists were put to death - six in Ahwaz, the southwestern oil city near a front of the war with Iraq, and one in the northern town of Babol.These actions were said to raise to about 90 the total number of executions on charges of ''counterrevolutionary'' activities since Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, the leader of secular, leftist and liberal groups, was removed from the presidency 10 days ago. **********The newspaper of the ruling party said that the authorities had uncovered20 ''safe houses'' of anti-Government groups in Teheran and arrested a number of people, including two high members of the Islamic Marxist guerrilla organization, Mujahedeen-i-Khalq. Fifty others were reportedly arrested Tuesday and accused of plotting to destroy the Parliament building. Khomeini Accuses Guerrillas **********Shortly before the arrests, the guerrillas' organization was denounced by Ayatollah Khomeini as responsible for the bombing of the Islamic Republican Party's headquarters on Sunday. **********Speaking today to the families of the 72 Islamic clerics and political figures killed in that attack, the Ayatollah said: ''It is the duty of all our people to watch every suspicious action and to find the saboteurs who have hidden and are planning further sabotage.'' **********He said, however, that citizens should not take the law into their own hands but should, ''at most, arrest these saboteurs and hand them over to the security forces.'' **********The Ayatollah warned all anti-Government groups in his speech to ''repent before it is too late,'' and he recalled that he had repeatedly warned Mr. Bani-Sadr ''to separate himself'' from the leftist guerrillas who supported his presidency because they ''would destroy him.'' Charges Against the U.S. **********Repeating his charge that the United States was involved in the bomb attack last Sunday, Ayatollah Khomeini described the action as an ''American movement against Islam.'' **********In other developments, the Interior Ministry said that all those wishing to run in the presidential elections on July 24 to replace the fugitive former leader, who was last seen in public three weeks ago today, should announce their candidacies beginning tomorrow.  Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai has been rumored as most likely to represent the ruling party and to win. **********Parliamentary by-elections for 46 seats, including those made vacant by the deaths of 27 in the bomb explosion, are to be held the same day, the Interior Ministry declared. Iran Rebuffs Cease-Fire Offer **********A Foreign Ministry spokesman said, according to the state radio, that Iran could not agree to a recent offer by Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, of a cease-fire in the war during the Moslem holy month of Ramadan, which begins tomorrow. **********It was also announced that Ayatollah Khomeini would hold no meetings during the Islamic month of Ramadan, a time of fast from dawn to dusk. **********Diplomats here said during the day that continued preoccupation with security matters - a result of the destruction of the party headquarters and other violent attacks - appeared certain to delay plans by Iranian leaders to revive the battered economy. **********They said that there had been brief optimism that, with the removal of Mr. Bani-Sadr on June 22, the clergy-dominated Government had neutralized its internal critics and could get down to the task of repairing the damage of the upheavals brought by the revolution of February 1979 and the nine-month-old war with Iraq. **********But, the diplomats added, the bomb blast on Sunday showed that the revolution was still under way and that stability could be a distant goal. ---- Iranians Seize Paris Office **********PARIS, July 2 (AP) - About 30 Iranians said to be leftists occupied the Iranian Consulate here for three hours today to protest executions in their homeland.

Called on to introduce the members of his delegation, Mr. Nujoma did not bother to read off names but simply declared, ''My delegation is one, united, representing the oppressed people of Namibia.'' With that, three rows of delegates rose smartly to their feet with their fists in the air in the familiar revolutionary salute. **********Mr. Nujoma then observed that some members of the delegation were not present because they were in prison on Robben Island off Cape Town and in Namibia. He ended by declaring his readiness to sign a cease-fire agreement with South Africa now, ''so that peace can come to Namibia.'' **********As soon as Mr. Nujoma was in his seat, with a broad smile breaking through his silver beard, Mr. Hough was calling for the floor to deliver an impromptu response that was evidently not part of the script. **********''There are many other people whom we would like to have in this delegation with us,'' the South African said heatedly, ''many who are killed, many who are in graves.''

Her Cabinet ministers do not share the ''siege economic view that if money flows overseas, it will deprive people of jobs,'' a Treasury official said. ''It makes economic sense in Government policy to build up this level of overseas dividend flow.'' **********Exporter of Investment Capital **********To be sure, having matured economically earlier than most countries, Britain has long been a key exporter of investment capital, despite exchange controls that date to 1939. **********As they ultimately developed, the controls prevented most direct conversions of sterling to foreign currencies by businesses, institutions and individuals. But these groups worked around the regulations by borrowing foreign currencies or by buying foreign currencies at a premium from a Government-regulated investment currency pool. **********But the extent of the outflow of money since October 1979, when the controls were abolished, is striking. Last week, the Treasury reported that in the first half of this year, the equivalent of $7.8 billion was invested outside Britain, compared with $4.9 billion in the similar period of 1980 and $3.3 billion in the first half of 1979, when restrictions were still in place. How the Money Leaves **********The money generally leaves in two ways. Individuals and financial institutions, including pension funds, engage principally in portfolio investment, purchasing financial assets like stocks and bonds. This category in particular has surged. However companies will often make direct investments, which means buying real assets, such as another company. **********The Treasury report said that investment institutions and unit trusts, which are similar to mutual funds, increased their proportion of overseas assets in the course of 1980 to 31 percent of total holdings from 24 percent. **********As for companies, hardly a day goes by without another overseas acquisition by a British company. Among the most publicized lately were Grand Metropolitan's acquisition of Intercontinental Hotels from Pan American World Airways and Midland Bank's purchase of the Crocker Bank in California. British pension funds have also been pouring money into American real estate. U.S. and Asia Attractive **********Thus far, the United States and the high-growth economies of Asia have proved most attractive. In its latest quarterly bulletin, the Bank of England said about half of Britain's overseas investments were now in North America. Last week, for example, Unigate Ltd., a major dairy here, agreed to purchase Casa Bonita, a West Coast fastfood chain. **********''We believe very strongly in the United States economy,'' said Daniel Hodson, Unigate's finance director, in an interview. ''Any multinational company should have a substantial portion of its earnings in the U.S.'' **********The example of Unigate also illustrates why many British executives agree with Mr. Hodson. With Britain in the midst of a recession, the company, in the year ended March 31, earned just $55 million in operating profit on sales of $2.2 billion, a return of 2.5 percent.  By comparison, its foreign subsidiaries - including two cheese companies in the United States - earned $17.5 million on sales of $296 million, a return of 5.8 percent. Impact on Total Earnings **********A recent study by Phillips & Drew, a stockbrokerage firm, concluded that, over all, 40 percent of British corporate profits last year came from overseas subsidiaries and another 15 percent resulted from export earnings. **********Supporters of exchange controls argue that, in view of the nation's troubles, Britain would be justified in taking what are essentially protectionist actions to develop jobs for the three million people out of work. Even many normally unsympathetic economists accept this view. **********But other economists note that if Britain's investors are forced to keep their money at home, interest rates would tend to be lower. That in turn would discourage non-British investors from bringing money here, even temporarily. The exchange rate would also probably be higher, which would exacerbate the problems British companies already have in competing in the export market. A Debate Over Goals **********''In the back of the Government's mind may be the thinking that they want to get some of the oil money invested overseas,'' said Gavyn Davies, chief economist at Simon & Coates, an investment firm, referring to the long debate over what to do with the fruits of the oil and gas finds in the British sector of the North Sea. **********Others believe that, even with controls, there is substantial leakage that negates much of their effect. During the last round of strictures, a variety of devices, including foreign holding companies, sprang up."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/16/world/hirohito-marks-anniversary-of-war-s-end-at-tokyo-rites.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hirohito Marks Anniversary Of War's End at Tokyo Rites", "print_headline": "Hirohito Marks Anniversary Of War's End at Tokyo Rites", "body_text": " **********Emperor Hirohito marked the 36th anniversary today of the end of World War II with a ''prayer for world peace'' in ceremonies before 6,600 people at Tokyo's Martial Arts Hall. **********''Even now, when I think of those who fell in the ranks of the last great war, or the many who perished in the ravages of that war, and their survivors, my heart is filled with pain,'' the 80-year-old Emperor said. **********Elderly people were predominant in the audience, many of them somberly dressed women who lost husbands or sons in the war.

The transaction could develop into a historic test case for Federal banking laws. **********The proposed merger would appear to conflict with the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which drew a line between investment banking and commercial banking. The act forbids commercial banks to own, underwrite or deal in corporate stocks and bonds. **********If the merger does proceed, it would give BankAmerica, owner of the nation's largest commercial bank, Bank of America, a decided advantage over its competitors. The merger would allow BankAmerica to offer a full range of ''one-stop'' financial services, from checking accounts to the sale of stocks. It would mark the first time that an American bank has acquired a brokerage house. **********Stephen T. McLin, senior vice president for strategic planning at BankAmerica, said that his company proposed the deal to Schwab last September and was confident that it could convince regulators that it would not violate the Glass-Steagall provisions. Confidence in Merger **********''Our attorneys feel that the merger will be permitted within the confines of the Glass-Steagall Act,'' Mr. McLin said. ''Charles Schwab does not underwrite securities, take positions for its own account or inventory securities, like a typical broker-dealer for whom the act was originally designed.'' **********The Glass-Steagall Act, argued Charles R. Schwab, chairman of the the brokerage house, was written after the stock market crash to prevent banks from selling or buying for their trust accounts securities that they had underwritten and to forbid them to lend money to concerns whose stocks they were offering. None of these issues, he said, would apply to a Schwab-BankAmerica marriage. **********''We are completely different from most brokers,'' Mr. Schwab said. ''Our business is exclusively executing stock orders for customers; we do not underwrite or trade ourselves, so there should be no conflict with the intent of Glass-Steagall.'' **********''Merrill Lynch and the other broker-dealers have been competing at the heart of the banking industry with their cash management accounts,'' Mr. McLin added, ''and now we will be able to compete at the heart of their industry. While Schwab will remain a separate subsidiary, we eventually hope to offer brokerage services at our branches and to offer banking services at Schwab's offices around the country to the extent which the various state banking regulations permit.'' Regulatory Approval Needed **********Mr. McLin said the proposed acquisition would require the approval of the BankAmerica board; the shareholders of the Charles Schwab Corporation, the parent company of the brokerage firm, and the Federal agencies with regulatory jurisdiction. He said his company had informed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board that it had signed a letter of intent to acquire Charles Schwab for 2.2 million shares of BankAmerica common stock, which would be worth about $53 million. **********Sources close to the BankAmerica management said the company was still debating whether to go through the Federal Reserve or the Comptroller's office for regulatory approval. **********Schwab is a 10-year-old privately held company with 38 offices around the country, but based only three blocks from the main office of BankAmerica in San Francisco. It is considered by analysts as one of the best-managed companies in the so-called bargain basement of the securities industry and a leading innovator. **********The firm expanded earlier this year with the acquisition of Kingsley, Boye & Southwood, a New York-based discount brokerage concern. Lower Fees Offered **********Schwab buys and sells stocks and bonds for fees that often are 50 percent below those of the major brokerage houses. In recent years, it has introduced services such as extended business hours, automatic transfers of cash into a money market fund and 60-second stock transactions. **********Mr. Schwab said there was no question that all the limited shareholders in his company would approve the sale, which would give ''it the capital resources to continue our rapid expansion.''

The active January platinum contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $14.30, to close the week at $632.90 an ounce. **********Some futures analysts attributed this to the fact that gold is mostly a ''monetary metal,'' whose price reflects the value of paper money and currently must compete for the favor of investors at a time when they can obtain relatively high returns on safe Treasury bills. Platinum, they note, is under even greater pressure because 95 percent of it is used by the depressed auto industry in antipollution devices and by petroleum and chemical makers as a catalyst. **********However, most commodity analysts do not expect the prices of gold and platinum to stay wedded forever. Most expect platinum to again sell at a premium. So does Rudolf Wolff Commodity Brokers Inc., the American affiliate of the London-based trading house, which is considered one of the leading dealers and brokers in physical metals. It is also 51 percent owned by Noranda Mines (Canada) Ltd., the large international copper mining concern. **********Last Friday, the American brokerage branch offered its opinion in its first published research report to its clients. Because the Soviet Union is the leading supplier of platinum and related metals, followed by South Africa, Rudolf Wolff expects the defense-oriented Reagan administration to increase substantially the United States' currently low stockpile of these strategic metals. **********''This factor could have, of course, effect on the market and could carry the price of platinum well over the premium of $100 an ounce above the gold price that existed during 1979 and early 1980.'' the Rudolf Wolff report said. **********It added : ''Such potential, therefore, represents a unique opportunity for sensible spreading by selling short gold futures and simultaneously purchasing platinum futures in this manner: Sell one 100-ounce Comex April 1981 gold contract and buy two 50-ounce New York Mercantile April platinum futures.'' **********Paul Sarnoff, research chief of Rudolf Wolff's American operations, said in an interview last Friday: ''Ideally, the spread should be effected at equal prices for both metals, but this is almost unlikely. Chances are the spread would come at a slight premium for platinum over gold, or conceivably a slight discount from gold's price. That is why orders for these spreads should contain a leeway of at least $10 an ounce either way.'' **********The initial goal is a $30 platinum premium over gold, for a gross profit of $3,000 on the spread, Mr. Sarnoff continued. ''We also recommend placing stop-loss orders limiting potential losses to $1,000 per spread, which should involve a cash outlay of about $5,000 plus commission.'' **********To limit loss to $1,000, the broker would have to cancel the spread when the loss on one leg exceeded the gain on the other by more than $10. Normally, there will be a loss on one leg because the spreader has simultaneously bought and sold short commodities that tend to move up or down together. The object of the spread is to have one leg of the spread produce more profit than the other's loss. **********If it does not work out that way, prudent futures traders cancel their spread as quickly as possible. But if it works well, the traders can drop the losing leg and run with the profitable one until the goal of the spread is acheived. **********What if one owns gold bullion, which is a ''sterile investment'' in that it produces no dividends or other income, and is enviously looking at the currently rising yields on Treasury bills. One way to ''own'' gold and receive the current 13.5 percent discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills was offered by Mr. Sarnoff. **********''Suppose one had 100 ounces of gold or, say, Krugerrands in the vault,'' he said. ''At today's price the 100 ounces would be worth $62,000. One could take the proceeds and buy a 100-ounce Comex gold futures contract with a maturity as far ahead as 20 months or so for a cash outlay of about $3,000 and put the rest of the money in Tbills, which would be held by the broker.'' **********There would be no margin calls because the broker could cover any price decline with the Treasury bills. Not only would the bills produce income and be rolled over at maturity, but so could the maturing futures. If the futures produce a gain, he said, the investor can tell his broker to apply the profit toward the purchase of more bills or other short-term money market instruments. **********If gold prices should appear headed on a long downward trend, the investor can usually get out of the futures with a phone call, instead of paying storage costs for an income-less metal that is declining in value, Mr. Sarnoff added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/21/business/advertising-grand-circle-travel-goes-to-frank-vos.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1981-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Grand Circle Travel Goes to Frank Vos", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Grand Circle Travel Goes to Frank Vos", "body_text": " **********The Frank Vos Company, an agency that specializes in direct marketing, has a new client: Grand Circle Travel, a wholesale travel agent that specializes in the over-50 market. **********Billings of more than $1 million are expected, according to the agency.

The four F-16's, whose delivery was scheduled for last month, were withheld pending a determination whether Israel had used Americansupplied planes in the raid in violation of United States statutes limiting such weapons to defensive purposes. **********American officials also made it clear that delaying the planes was a way of reprimanding Israel and calming Arabs who demanded that the United States condemn Israel for the attack on Iraq. Assurances on Other F-16's **********After it delayed the June deliveries, however, the Administration announced that it would go ahead with delivery of six other F-16's to be released to Israel tomorrow. White House spokesmen said at the time that the matter of the four planes would be resolved by the time the six were due to be delivered. **********Since the policy was announced July 1, it has been regarded as a foregone conclusion that the United States would eventually deliver all the planes. But the Administration faced the problem of working out a diplomatic explanation for its action that did not appear either to endorse Israel's attack or to call into question the United States' role as an ally of Israel. **********Participants in a White House meeting on the issue last night included Edwin Meese 3d, Counselor to the President; Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.; Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger; Richard V. Allen, Mr. Reagan's national security adviser, and the State Department counselor, Robert C.

It was from these refugees that Battalion 202 was formed five years ago, one of two San battalions in South Africa's military forces in South-West Africa. **********The San, who are famed for their tracking abilities, fought fiercely against encroachment by white settlers in the 18th and 19th centuries but were defeated. Culturally rich but technologically primitive and declining in numbers, they are estimated to total 50,000. **********''If they weren't in the army, there'd be nothing else for them to do,'' a South African lieutenant, Ben Wolff, said. Six-Week Tours in War Zone **********Some 850 San troops, 2,700 dependents and 250 whites are at this base, one of an undisclosed number along the Caprivi Strip, a fertile area rich in game in the northeastern corner of the territory. The troops are flown to the main war area in Ovamboland for six-week tours. **********Lieutenant Wolff, who is the main training officer because he speaks a dialect of the complex clicking San language, said, ''SWAPO usually clears out when they know there are Bushmen around.'' He was referring to the insurgent group by its initials. **********The San are fighting not only because of the absence of employment in this virtually undeveloped area but also because they fear that if the guerrillas are victorious they will be massacred for having supported the Portuguese in Angola. **********Apart from two San corporals, the officers, both commissioned and noncommissioned, are white. Black and white privates are paid equally. **********San boys get a junior high school education in Afrikaans, the predominant language among South African whites, with boxing and soccer lessons, and once a month they are taken into the bush by a San elder to learn tracking and hunting with bow and arrow. Traditions Being Preserved **********Although the San here are no longer nomads, the army authorities want to preserve as many of their traditions as possible. They have kept their religion although there is a Christian church on the base. ''Our aim is not to Westernize them but to make them a better Bushman,'' Lieutenant Wolff told visiting foreign correspondents. **********The base has a hospital with a well-equipped operating room, but San women still bear their children in the bush, though they bring them in to see the doctor the following day. The doctor, a white, is assisted by four San nursing aides and three interpreters. **********The guerrilla war has little effect on the tranquillity of the Caprivi, mainly because there are no guerrilla forces in the area of Angola that lies immediately to the north. The guerrillas cannot operate there as it is a stronghold of Unita, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, a South African-supported organization that unsuccessfully fought in a three-sided civil war after the end of Portuguese rule and is still harassing the forces of the Marxist Angolan Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/09/business/executive-changes-257758.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 381, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Arco Publishing Inc., a Prentice-Hall company, has appointed Peter C.

I simply cannot believe this has happened.'' The news came over Polish television in a special bulletin at 5:30 P.M. The entire half-hour evening news program was devoted to the event. To expand its coverage, the Polish network picked up Italian television and provided a voice-over translation. Programs were interrupted to provide later information. Unusual Pickup From Italian TV **********The television coverage, with its direct, live pickup of Italian programming, was unprecedented in a Soviet-bloc country. The Polish announcer's voice quivered as he said: ''The Pope was struck by three bullets that entered his body. His white robes were stained with blood.'' **********The reaction from the Communist Party and the Government was swift.  ''The news of the criminal attempt on the life of Your Holiness comes as a great shock to the Polish nation and the authorities of the Polish People's Republic,'' said a message signed by Stanislaw Kania, the party leader, and by President Henryk Jablonski and Gen.  Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Prime Minister. **********''In this grievous moment we send to Your Holiness from your fatherland our wishes for a speedy recovery of your strength so indispensable to fulfilling your mission in the service of humanistic ideals of peace and the welfare of mankind.'' **********The church and the labor movement, the two other major Polish institutions, responded in a similar vein.  ''We cannot find the words to sufficiently condemn this criminal act,'' said a statement from the episcopate read over television by a spokesman, the Rev. Alojzy Orszulik, standing in front of the Pope's portrait. ''The whole church of Poland prays for the Holy Father's quick return to health and active services to the church on the Throne of St. Peter.'' **********A message from the union leadership spoke of the shock it felt and added: ''Let your suffering be a symbol of love for man. We have hope in Poland that you will quickly recover.'' **********By nightfall, hundreds of thousands had attended special masses.  Thousands crowded into the church at Wadowice in southern Poland, where the Pope was born and baptized. **********In Warsaw, people gravitated to the Old Town, walking up and down the cobbled streets and stopping to pray in any one of dozens of churches. **********In the Jesuit church, the Sanctuary of the Gracious Madonna, the first church in which the Pope prayed in 1979, the presiding priest told a congregation that flowed down the steps and into the street that the shooting ''is proof of the existence of the forces of hate.'' **********''We must pray to the Madonna that she protect us so that the forces of hate disappear from the world,'' he said. Then he led a procession down the center aisle, to a marble and gold tablet commemorating the Pope's visit, and laid a bouquet of flowers as a ''sign of our love.'' **********''Madonna, Queen of Poland, we pray to you,'' he began, and many sank to their knees, weeping.

Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company produces more than 45,000 different products, from suntan lotion to sandpaper, from skin staples to Scotch tape. ''3M's business is not producing any one product,'' says Ty Govatos, who follows the company for Bache Halsey Stuart Shields. ''Its business is inventing new products. For years the whole structure of the company has been designed for that purpose.'' **********Lewis W. Lehr, 60 years old, 3M's chairman, recently completed a major revamping of the company's management and marketing approach in an effort to insure that 3M will continue to churn out new ideas during the next two decades. Mr. Lehr, and John M. Pitblado, 63, the president of 3M's United States operations, were in New York last week to explain the company's new look to the area sales staff. In an interview, they talked about some of the key issues affecting the future of 3M and other American manufacturers. **********Q. In your speech to the sales staff you referred to the breakdown of monolithic structures in our society in the 1980's and 1990's.  What does that mean for 3M? LEHR: ''If you look at the entrepreneurship of American industry it's wonderful. On the other hand, if you look at the paternalism and discipline of Japanese companies, it's wonderful too. There are certain companies that have evolved into a blend of those industries and 3M is one of them. The explanation of why this is happening is indicative of this monolithic breakdown. **********Companies like 3M have become sort of a community center for employees, as opposed to just a place to work. We have employee clubs, intramural sports, travel clubs and a choral group. This has happened because the community in which people live has become so mobile it is no longer an outlet for the individual. The schools are no longer a social center for the family. The churches have lost their drawing power as social-family centers. **********With the breakdown of these traditional structures, certain companies have filled the void. They have become sort of mother institutions, but have maintained their spirit of entrepreneurship at the same time. **********Q. American companies have been continually yielding ground to the Japanese. We have lost the lead in automobiles, steel and some hightechnology fields. What is behind this? LEHR: The Japanese have selected certain industries in which to become leaders and have done so. This country is not as disciplined as Japan. I think that's very good because if we were so disciplined we probably wouldn't be leaders in computers and the bio fields. But lack of discipline has created part of our problem. We have compounded that with a lack of incentives for research and the additional regulations and costs we have imposed on industry. This is what has created the problem. **********Q. Growth in productivity in the United States has declined steadily in the past decade, save for a few companies like 3M which continually managed to cut its per-unit manufacturing costs. How have you escaped this national malaise? PITBLADO: Productivity is not accomplished by getting a man to dig a hole faster. Productivity is accomplished by giving him a power shovel, and power shovels cost money. 3M has continued its capital investment in the areas of productivity improvement. But look at the steel and auto industries, where we see little productivity growth. I think the newest plant Chrysler had was 16 years old. That is where our productivity problem on a national scale is not being addressed. **********It takes new tools, new plants and new systems to make a man dig, instead of one shovelful, 10 yards of dirt with the same pull of the hand. **********Q. What do you see as 3M's biggest area for potential growth?  PITBLADO: We see a tremendous need worldwide for the increased production of food, nonpolluting herbicides and other ways of controlling the problems related to growing food and fiber without fertilizers. We think we can increase the amount of protein in sugar and grass. Who cares? Grass is the largest crop in the world and most of the world depends on it for animal food. It's a tremendous opportunity and a tremendous opportunity to do good. Thomas L.

Late in the day, the outstanding 16 percent notes due in September 1983 were offered at 100 26/32 to yield 15.48 percent. **********Bond prices dropped sharply late in the day and were heavily influenced by trading in the futures markets, where bond contracts fell three-quarters of a point. Analysts stressed that many investors were on the sidelines and that the declines were caused by professional traders, many of them reacting automatically to technical sell signals. **********By late in the day, the actively traded 13 7/8 percent Treasury bond due in 2011 was offered at 94 14/32 to yield 14.60 percent, down from 95 7/8 a day earlier. High Financing Costs **********Many analysts said that weak investor demand might encourage dealers to cut prices so that yields were higher and more attractive by early November, when the Treasury is expected to sell $9 billion of notes and bonds. **********High financing costs also helped increase yields for short-term and long-term issues yesterday. The rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market was around 15 3/4 percent most of the day, despite the Fed's move to buy securities temporarily and provide reserves to the banking system for two days. The high funds rate dampened hopes for a drop in overnight financing costs, dealers said. **********The bias toward lower prices was enhanced when the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced plans to sell tomorrow $250 million each of five-year and 10-year bonds. **********Besides the additional supply of securities, some dealers said the World Bank move was bad news for the market because it was a sign that financial planners at the World Bank expected interest rates to move higher. The World Bank, whose financial expertise is highly respected, is not infallible, however. Last July, it deferred a similar financing even though yields were lower then. **********In the tax-exempt market, investors bought about half of a $100 million issue of triple-A-rated Illinois bonds at yields ranging from 8.75 percent for bonds due in 1982 to 10 1/2 percent for bonds due in 1991 and 12.4 percent for bonds due in 2005-06. Underwriters led by Continental Illinois said bonds due in 1997-2001 were not publicly reoffered. Problems at Washington Power **********While the Washington Public Power Supply System is trying to resolve problems in financing five nuclear power plants, prices of its outstanding bonds have suffered. Dealers said the secondary market for the $2.25 billion of outstanding Baa-1-rated bonds of Projects 4 and 5 was especially thin, and warned that prices would fall further if investors tried to sell more than a handful of bonds. The the 12 1/2 percent issue due in 2012 was bid at about 79 yesterday with a yield to maturity well in excess of 15 1/2 percent. **********The triple-A-rated power system bonds of Projects 1, 2 and 3, which have backing from the Bonneville power administrator, have also suffered and are trading with yields higher than the 14 percent return typical for other long-term double-A-rated electric revenue issues. Yesterday, the 15 percent Aaa-rated bonds due in 2017 were offered at 104 1/2 to yield 14.3 percent to maturity, down from 108 1/4 early Friday. **********At the other end of the maturity spectrum, the Municipal Assistance Corporation's new commercial paper issuing program included an agreement with Citibank providing M.A.C. with ''worst case'' financial insurance. The bank agreement was a necessary part of the commercial paper program, which M.A.C. can use to save interest expenses and give more flexibility in timing its long-term bond sales. **********Besides the tactical uses of short-term paper, M.A.C.'s executive director, Heather Ruth, explained that the Citibank facility provided insurance against the day when, for some reason, M.A.C. could not repay maturing commercial paper.

The British and Cuban flags fly side by side, and portraits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Fidel Castro hang in the clubhouse. **********On a warm, languid afternoon, the shrieking of children fills the pool area, and the Ambassador from Sierra Leone may be found sipping a drink in the bar before a tennis game. All members of the foreign diplomatic community may join the club. Membership for others is handled pretty much the way it is at country clubs anywhere. **********After the revolution, Cubans were eligible for membership.  President Salvador Allende Gossens of Chile liked to play golf there when he visited Cuba and Mr. Castro was even made honorary president. **********Otherwise, the golf tournaments and the dances continued, surviving along with other anachronisms such as the extremely popular and festive 15th-year birthday parties for girls -the equivalent of a debut - and the Cubans' disconcerting insistence that women wear long gowns to formal parties and receptions. Many Members Leave Country **********Then, in April 1980, the Peruvian Embassy crisis brought a huge exodus by boat from the port of Mariel and the beginning of the end for the Rovers Athletic Club. Among those who left were many of its Cuban members. **********''They weren't very revolutionary people,'' a Canadian officer of the club conceded regretfully. ''They liked our way of life.'' The Cuban authorities placed the club in trusteeship in July, explaining that it had failed to comply with some legal technicalities in its registration and, worse, had been infiltrated by ''antisocial elements.'' The Cuban membership of the club dropped from 200 to about 20, and the club's treasury of more than $100,000 was confiscated. **********The 80 foreign members, who lost all their legal appeals, have been told they can continue to use the facilities and that these will be even better than before. In the meantime, members of the Cuban secret police keep an eye on the place. **********One showed up at a Havana hotel where a visitor had arranged to meet one of the remaining Cuban club members, who has a visa to leave for Venezuela but has not been able to get an exit permit from the Cuban Government. **********When he saw the policeman, who is also his neighbor, the Cuban was so terrified he was barely able to speak.  ''It was an island of freedom,'' he managed to say of the club. **********Another society is being built at the Grandes Alamedas infant center in Havana, where 229 children aged from 45 days to six years can spend from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. if their mothers are working. **********The children are fed, given medical attention and even provided with the clothing or diapers they wear. A child's development, from its first efforts to sit up to its expression of patriotic sentiments, is closely monitored. **********Cristina Ribalta, a psychologist with the Ministry of Education, who is at the center studying the links between the emotional and intellectual development of children, said attempts are being made to motivate children better, to help them understand early in life that efforts bring rewards. **********''If children do a task and get a result,'' she said, ''they can see the fruit of their labors.'' There is not a great deal of individual attention - the school has just seven teachers - but this did not seem to bother the toddlers and pre-schoolers playing happily and relatively peacefully with each other in the sun-drenched play yard. **********The infants, on the other hand, looked apathetic and lay quietly in their rows of plain wooden cribs without toys, staring into the air. **********There are still many people in Cuba who want to leave. They range from the genteel Rovers Club member to the former mental patient who, armed with two grenades, hijacked a bus in the province of Matanzas the other day and demanded to be taken to Varadero to catch a boat, an episode that ended with one death and 13 injuries when the hijacker threw the grenades. **********With an American visitor, older Cubans will talk about their desire for freedom, but the younger ones speak of their yearning for money and for jobs. **********Salaries in Cuba are low, ranging from the equivalent of $96 a month for a janitor or street sweeper to $384 a month for a psychiatrist or other medical specialist A taxi driver earns $151 a month; a high school teacher earns $177. **********Medical care is free, as are schools, and rents are low, 10 percent of one's salary. Appliances are expensive: $833 for a television set, $1,538 for a standard refrigerator or an air conditioner, $6,4l0 for a Soviet car. Air conditioners and cars are available only to party officials and to special workers. **********But the big problem seems to be food, which is still rationed. For one month, one person may buy only 12 ounces of meat, two pounds of chicken, five pounds of rice, 10 ounces of beans, 10 ounces of peas and one four-ounce can of tomato concentrate. Milk can be bought for children under the age of 12. The monthly allotment of coffee for adults is four ounces. **********Oil, salt, bread, sugar and cigarettes are also rationed. Dinner Guests Eat Hungrily **********In an effort to provide more food, the Cuban Government has encouraged farmers' markets, where peasants may sell food at freemarket prices, but these prices are high, and although the markets seem to have helped, there are still many people who are hungry. **********It is not the shocking hunger that assaults a visitor to a country such as Haiti. It is far less severe, but it is also difficult for visitors to ignore. **********A Western diplomat who had invited a group of Cuban intellectuals to his home for a buffet dinner realized to his dismay that he was going to run out of food because his guests were taking five and six helpings. The men in the group were so hungry they did not volunteer to bring plates for their wives or even to wait for them before starting to eat. **********And on an outing to Santa Maria beach one recent Sunday it was clear that very few of the hundreds of Cubans enjoying the water had brought picnic lunches or were able to buy anything to eat. When foreign visitors brought out a cooler filled with beer and rather uncomfortably started eating the hot dogs they had brought along, Cubans, by themselves or in groups, came and stood from four to five feet away and stared. **********Finally, a tough-looking man strode up and demanded food, saying rather belligerently, ''I'm hungry.'' When the visitors offered him two hot dogs, he proudly refused, indicating that he would make do with one."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/world/algeria-agrees-to-oil-parley.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Algeria Agrees to Oil Parley", "print_headline": "Algeria Agrees to Oil Parley", "body_text": " **********Algeria has agreed to a special meeting of the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to try to establish a common price structure, the official Algerian press agency said today.

A bag holds 132.2 pounds of unroasted coffee beans. **********Coffee prices were about 32 cents a pound in 1962. In real terms, prices have slumped to a 1962-equivalent of 30 cents a pound.

Last year, the overall 1980-81 export quota was set at 57.7 million bags. But because prices continued to fall, the coffee group cut this total four times during the crop year, reducing the overall export quota to 51.1 million bags.

Berisford Ltd. was a sleepy company making a nice profit importing food and handling the distribution of sugar in Britain. Then, under new management with new ideas, the company threw itself into the highstakes business of commodity trading. **********The result was a spectacular period of growth. In the last 10 years, earnings before taxes increased from just $6 million to $79 million last year, while revenues shot up from $334 million to almost $5.4 billion. In 1980, almost 70 percent of the company's profits came from commodity trading and distribution, with the rest spread mostly across food processing and scrap metal recovery. **********But now S.& W. Berisford is once again seeking to return to a more stable business. Last month, the company offered the equivalent of about $340 million for the 91 percent of the British Sugar Corporation that it does not already own. **********''Since we have been selling sugar in the United Kingdom for 100 years, we know a fair bit about the business,'' Gordon Percival, a director of the London-based Berisford, said in an interview.  ''British Sugar fits like a glove.'' **********That, however, is not the opinion of the board of directors of British Sugar, which refines more than half the sugar sold in Britain each year. The board rejected the bid unanimously and has begun a campaign to convince shareholders to do the same. Bid Called 'Derisory' **********At this point, British Sugar's main defense is the low price of the offer, which values each British sugar share at $6.23. John Beckett, chief executive of British Sugar, called the bid ''deriso@ry.'' British Sugar has put the asset value of its shares at almost $11 each. ''We are fighting off the bid and want to remain as we are,'' a spokesman for British Sugar said. **********British Sugar, which refines all the sugar beet production in Britain (adding up to almost one-half the sugar consumed), is subject to the European Economic Community's agricultural policy fixing the amount of sugar beets refined in Britain. Under a new quota and price agreement that takes effect in July, analysts estimate that British Sugar could make nearly $100 million this year in pretax profits, compared with $75 million in the last financial year. **********Berisford, according to financial analysts, will do well to equal last year's earnings performance of $79 million pretax. ''The company has hit a bit of a plateau, which is a reflection of dull commoditytrading conditions,'' one analyst said. ''Berisford hopes that British Sugar's earnings will be more stable.'' **********The hunt for acquisitions began about three years ago, according to John Elston, a food analyst at the London firm of James Capel & Company. ''The idea was that one-half of the company profits would come from commodity trading, and the other half would come from tangible assets,'' he said. **********Although the past decade of wildly fluctating commodity prices has given traders ample opportunity to make profits, the risk, increasingly complicated by the politics of the producing nations, is considerable. ''In our acquisitions we are not anxious to take on the same political risks as we do in our other businesses,'' Mr.  Percival said. **********For its part, Berisford has proved to be a patient suitor. Last May, the company made its first offer for British Sugar. The Government, disturbed by Berisford's role as distributor for Tate & Lyle, Britain's only other sugar manufacturer, referred the offer to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission. **********After nine months, the commission concluded at the beginning of last month that it would not block the bid if two conditions were met. First, Berisford must sever its link with Tate & Lyle. Second, and more ambiguously, Berisford must maintain British Sugar as a separate entitity. Government Stake Is Issue **********Berisford has no problems with these conditions. ''The statement may read as if it is the commission's thought, but we had freely offered those conditions ourselves,'' Mr. Percival said. **********The transaction is further complicated by the Government's ownership of almost 25 percent of British Sugar's shares. Although the Government has announced its intention of selling its shares as part of a larger policy of returning Government investments back to the private sector, it cannot very well sell its shares at what is being seen as a discount."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/05/business/quotations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "QUOTATIONS", "print_headline": "QUOTATIONS", "body_text": " **********''I don't know how it can get any worse.

The activity not only provides him with a link to the sport during the players' strike, but is an initiation into the world of American business. For the lessons a boy learns from managing a shoebox full of baseball cards are as hard and sobering as any gotten over the bargaining table in a complex labor dispute. **********Baseball card collecting is still a very sexist thing. There are no women on the cards, and the hobby is practiced almost exclusively among a network of good young boys, who will grow up to join the good-old-boy network. After their team and position, the hirsute heroes on the cards are described by the vital statistics of height and weight - 6 feet 3 inches, 190 pounds - which all the boys want to attain. There are no models here for young girls. **********What baseball card collecting does teach its participants are all the elements of successful business practice. While it is of course not the only introduction to the realities of the business world, it is a traditional one for boys. To collect and trade cards requires a youngster to become comfortable, or at least proficient, in buying, selling, trading, risking and generally managing his most important and valuable possessions. There must be an awareness of worth and a deliberateness of purpose in trying to decide whether to specialize in getting the entire home team or diversifying by filling out an all-star team of interleague dimensions. **********Assembling the capital of a baseball card collection is as instructive as any other stage of the activity. The boy must make what are usually among his first regular purchases that cannot be wholly eaten or drunk. Although the wrapper may be ripped and discarded like that of a candy bar, the baseball cards and not the token bubble gum are the treasure inside. Buying a package of cards is as important to the young boy as purchasing a stock is to his father. But the element of mystery, the joy of the blind gamble of the purchase, is unique to baseball card collectors and venture capitalists. Unwrapping the package is a holiday, and scanning the contents is an adventure. **********On the backs of his baseball cards a boy's fascination with numbers begins, preparing him for the Dow Jones industrial average, the Consumer Price Index and Moody's credit ratings. Besides the heights and weights and birthdates, there are the columns of performance figures that contain as much mathematics and as many subtleties of interpretation as an adult will encounter in reading the market reports. **********The young card collector soon learns to scan a new card for his touchstone statistics as naturally as the commuter scans the newspaper to follow his investments. The boy with a baseball card collection knows averages, records and statistics the way a market analyst knows prices, dividends and betas. **********The seemingly idle hours spent reading the fine print behind the picture of a baseball player are rewarded in eye muscles attuned to the format of the business pages, if not in mental skills favorably inclined to mathematical achievement tests. **********A boy's trading cards also give him the chronology of a baseball player's record through obscure minor league teams to success in the majors. The repeated reminder that success and celebrity come of humble beginnings is precisely the lesson one needs later to put his foot firmly on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder and climb with deliberation. **********Perhaps the greatest lessons of baseball cards are learned on the trading floors of boys' bedrooms. Here hard decisions and value judgments must be made by children alone in a world of cardboard adults. The worth of a card wanted must be weighed against that of a card or cards willing to be traded. Order must be maintained among piles of cards numbering in the hundreds to the thousands, none of whose provenance or ownership is documented or documentable beyond the agreements of little gentlemen. **********My son is now investing virtually all of his modest allowance in baseball cards, and he is bullish on new issues. His present portfolio consists of about 100 Fleer, 100 Don Russ, 200 Topps common and an odd lot of autographed Topps preferred. He holds his own trading with the older boys, and soon I expect him to be willing to trade more than just the Yankees for a share of Telephone. **********Not all traders are gentlemen, of course, and stories are told among the eight- and nine-year-olds of 11- and 12-year-olds to be watched. And the younger traders learn quickly that it is against their interests to give in to unreasonable demands for a card they want, no matter how badly. Even a Fernando Valenzuela is not worth the whole Yankee team.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Henry Petroski is an associate professor of civil engineering at Duke University and regrets that he no longer has his own baseball cards."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/03/business/technology-measuring-the-cutting-edge.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1981-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 853, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Technology; Measuring the 'Cutting Edge'", "print_headline": "Technology; Measuring the 'Cutting Edge'", "body_text": " **********TO hear executives talk, the ''cutting edge'' of technology in most industries must be very crowded. One reason so many companies can claim this position may be that their audiences are generally too polite to laugh. Another explanation could be that the executives doing the talking do not know any better. **********''The average upper-level corporate executive is deluged with information on finance, sales and production performance, but receives virtually no objective information on the firm's technological health,'' said Richard S. Campbell, a researcher at the Battelle Institute's Pacific Northwest Laboratories in Richland, Wash., who has been studying technology indicators with the aid of a National Science Foundation grant. **********That technology information gap contributes to the widely noted bias of many businesses toward maximizing short-term performance, he added. Referring to the ''tug-of-war for managerial attention and resources,'' he said, ''The tabulators with numbers almost always triumph over the technologists.'' **********Help may lie in the United States Patent Office. Results of the early phases of the Battelle study of patent data as a technology indicator have been intriguing. While many companies routinely track the patent activity of their competitors, the Battelle study suggests that more systematic research into particular technologies, or ''problem domains,'' can reveal rich profiles. **********In some cases, technological shifts show up in patents well in advance of their appearance in other indicators, such as the volume of papers published in technical journals. The data in patents can also be used to determine whether a technology is growing, maturing or dying, the rate of change, and the relative patent position of various competitors, according to Mr. Campbell. **********The first technology examined by Battelle was that used in the catalytic converter, the pollution control device widely used on automobiles. Simply looking at the number of patents filed each year indicated that converters might become an important technology 15 years before a large number of technical articles on the subject began to appear. **********Battelle went on to identify 10 technological indicators that might be derived from patents. For example, the number of patents in a given period, the number of new firms receiving patents in the area, the number of active firms and the number of dropouts might all be combined to measure how active a technology has been in that period. **********If many new firms are entering an area, one might conclude that there is a widespread belief that the technology addresses a significant need in an economical manner. Conversely, if many firms have apparently ceased efforts to patent in an area, it could mean that the technology has been superseded or that one company has a position so strong that it can dominate competitors. **********Another indicator - Battelle calls it ''immediacy'' - draws on the requirement that patent applicants cite related articles and inventions. If the ''closest prior art,'' as such citations are known, is very recent, one might conclude that the technology is growing rapidly. **********To examine ''dominance,'' Batelle looks at the pattern of closest prior art citations among firms. A great deal of self-citation may indicate that a firm believes that it has a key patent or simply that it follows a defensive patenting policy. If a company frequently cites another's patents, it may indicate a technological dependency or offensive patenting. **********There is plenty of skepticism about the value of such extensive patent analysis. ''There are a lot of companies who have decided that patent activity is more a function of the number of lawyers you have than of innovativeness,'' said John M. Ketteringham, a health care industry and corporate strategy specialist at the consulting firm of Arthur D. Little in Cambridge, Mass. **********Mr. Campbell's response is that in-depth analysis reveals whether the lawyers are building up the company's position in a key, fastdeveloping area or wasting its resources by piling up patents in an area that everyone else has abandoned. However, he conceded that the concept of patent analysis may not be equally helpful in every industry. **********The semiconductor industry, for instance, is famous for freely trading product patents and sometimes not even bothering to seek patents. The rapid pace of new-product introductions limits the value of the 17-year patent protection period and large semiconductor consumers are sometimes reluctant to commit themselves to a new design unless more than one company is offering it. However, Mr.  Campbell said, one could still learn something about technological strength in the industry by focusing on patents for manufacturing processes, rather than for the products themselves. **********Mr. Ketteringham, who has been working on ways to apply Arthur D.  Little's general strategic planning theories to technology investment strategies, expressed reservations about the usefulness of patent analysis but said that he agreed wholeheartedly with Mr.  Campbell's observations about the need for objective information.  ''We have had numerous big companies come to us in the past year expressing just that need,'' he said. ''They know they are involved with risk but they don't know how to characterize or express it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/11/business/tyler-to-acquire-parts-distributor.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1981-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 45, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tyler to Acquire Parts Distributor", "print_headline": "Tyler to Acquire Parts Distributor", "body_text": " **********The Hall-Mark Electronics Corporation and the Tyler Corporation, both of Dallas, announced agreements under which Tyler will purchase all Hall-Mark stock for $50 million.

That is, to do absolutely nothing. **********Even when doing nothing has considerable intellectual appeal, politicians seem unable to make a positive case for it. No one wants to be a member of a do-nothing Congress or Administration. Generally, we have to do nothing very quietly. **********I certainly do not wish to claim that doing nothing is the solution to all of our problems. I would only argue that it is always an option and that it always deserves careful consideration. **********The appeal of doing nothing stems from a few simple rules.  First, free markets and the natural dymanics of the business cycle often solve problems long before the bureaucracy can limber itself up to devise a solution. Thus, it is always important to consider the possibility that the solution may be enacted after the problem has vanished. Then, the possibility arises that the solution will do more harm than good. **********Second, solutions must generally be enacted by politicians who have very short-time horizons. Consequently, short-run solutions become appealing even for long-run problems. They are seldom appropriate. A corollary stems from the fact that the politician's time horizon shrinks as an election approaches, and the probability of doing the wrong thing varies inversely with the distance from the next election. **********Third, powerful special-interest groups often stand to gain or lose significant amounts of income as a result of any solution to a problem. Therefore, they work hard to play a role in designing the relevant policy. The end result may be a solution that is not in the best interest of the ordinary voter. Because different interest groups favor different solutions, the chosen policy often represents a compromise. That leads to Rule No. 4, compromises often turn out to be worse than any of the extreme positions, perhaps because they are inherently very complicated. **********Does doing nothing have any appeal when confronted by our current problems of recession, high interest rates and soaring budget deficits? One problem with the do-nothing approach is that it is not easy to define given our complex policy-making processes. **********In one sense the Congress has been doing plenty of nothing recently. The appropriations bills, which in theory should have been enacted for fiscal year 1982 before Labor Day, are still far from completed. The second budget resolution which is supposed to be in place by Sept. 15 is unlikely to be completed before Thanksgiving. **********All that is not what I mean by doing nothing. It is instead the result of a paralysis caused by an overabundance of policy options being placed on the table. If we are to do nothing, it is preferable to do it aggressively and not by default. **********What does that mean in the present context? To me it implies sticking with the 1982 policies inherent in the first budget resolution. It also implies readily admitting that given the recession, the deficit implied by those policies may be more than twice as large as the $37.7 billion originally estimated. The Administration and the Congress must stop gradually dribbling out higher and higher deficit estimates like Chinese water torture. **********Of course, a major long-run deficit problem remains. The tax cut was far too large even if the Administration were to obtain all of its proposed specified and unspecified spending cuts, and they will not. Taxes will have to be increased eventually. But because of my corollary to Rule 2, the period just preceding an election is a terrible time to debate tax policy. **********I DO not mind violating the do-nothing rule by making further cuts on the spending side. But the sort of cuts now being contemplated, even in the President's September budget proposal, are trivial relative to future deficits. Long-run spending control is essentially impossible without Social Security control and sensible reforms of that program are not possible in an election year. **********The time for major spending and tax changes is in that brief period of rationality following elections. A new economic strategy should be designed in the Administration and Congressional budgets that will be offered in early 1983. By that time, the recession should be behind us and we shall have a much clearer picture of the sort of tax increases and spending reform required for reduced deficits and healthy economic growth in the mid-1980's. **********In suggesting this nonaction course for 1982, I am relying heavily on Rule 1, that many of our current problems will cure themselves.  More specifically, I believe that because of the current recession, interest rates will continue to fall despite a large deficit. **********Falling interest rates and steady money growth will create a recovery by early 1982, before any new policies could possibly have any impact. If this is wrong and if we, like the British, are faced with continued high interest rates combined with a much more severe recession than anyone now contemplates, it may be necessary to rethink our policies before early 1983. **********But, even with such a dire situation, it may be that we, like Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, should decide to stick with the current policy course. Doing nothing to change things is particularly appealing when it is hard to think of anything better to do.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Rudolph G.
