Wall Street's response did not encourage the opening of left-over champagne. **********Particularly weak was the report by the computer retailer CompUSA Inc., which has taken investors on a wild ride in the last 12 months. The company announced  that its sales for the last three months of 1996 rose 1.5 percent, far below the 3 percent to 6 percent increase many analysts expected. On a day when many retail stocks declined sharply -- and when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged early before recovering much of its losses -- CompUSA's shares were down $4.50, or 22 percent, to $16.25, and were the most active on the Big Board. The decline prompted several analysts to speculate that consolidation among computer merchants was in the offing. **********''We are disappointed with this number,'' said James McCall, who manages the Large Cap Growth Fund at PBHG, a mutual fund company in Wayne, Pa. ''The guidance that we were getting was that they were doing O.K., but apparently the promotional environment last month got very strong.'' **********Mr. McCall declined to say whether he intended to sell the fund's CompUSA shares, but added that he thought there was a long-term possibility for recovery in the computer retail sector, which suffered poor sales and weak earnings during the latter part of 1996. Shares of CompUSA, which is based in Dallas, had risen strongly last summer and fall, briefly trading above $30 in October, before descending. **********Two other retailers also reported disappointing results yesterday, though their figures covered December, not the fourth quarter. The J. C. Penney Company said  that December same-store sales -- those at stores open at least a year -- rose 6.2 percent, but its profit margins were weak. The Dayton Hudson Corporation reported a 4.2 percent rise in same-store sales. **********While Dayton Hudson's numbers seemed acceptable on the surface, the company said that next week, when the full holiday season is accounted for, sales at its Target division would be flat, while sales at the department store unit would fall sharply. **********The shares of both companies fell on the New York Stock Exchange. J. C. Penney closed at $47.875, down 87.5 cents, and Dayton Hudson closed at $38.25, down $1. The Dow Jones industrial average fell only 5.78 points yesterday, though it was down nearly 100 points early in the day, after a big drop on Tuesday. **********The Christmas shopping season had started with a bang the day after Thanksgiving, but it ended with a small peep the final weekend as retailers went running in a panic for their markdown price guns, fearing that shoppers would not buy at full price. Hurting matters further, the entire season -- from Thanksgiving to Christmas -- was five days shorter than last year, when sales were weak. **********While markdowns might have inflated sales at the end of the month, they cut profit margins for many retailers, analysts said, and the result may be poor earnings. **********J. C. Penney provided an example of this problem. The chain, which is based in Plano, Tex., said that its  margins for November and December were below plan and that its earnings for the fourth quarter would come in between $1.15 and $1.25 a share, down from the analysts' consensus of $1.48. The company also said it would take an after-tax charge of about $180 million related to its acquisition of the Eckerd Corporation, a drugstore chain. **********''I think they have very dull merchandising and the visual presentation in many of the stores is poor,'' Robert F. Buchanan, an analyst at NatWest Securities, said. ''They have to focus on the core business.'' **********But CompUSA's report was the most surprising. The company's chief executive, James F. Halpin, said that low consumer demand and the delayed arrival of some products  would take its toll on earnings. **********''Everybody knew the whole market for computers was soft,'' Barry Rothberg, an analyst at Furman Selz in New York, said. ''CompUSA had become a cult stock, and at the end of the day, they were too big a player to be immune to general market forces.'' **********Direct marketers of computers have gone from nibbling market share to wolfing down large portions of it, a trend that is likely to continue as they improve their ability to reach  customers. Further, consumers, many of whom loaded up on computers and related products in 1995, yawned at the relatively meager number of new offerings this Christmas, a problem that was exacerbated by delays in shipping some new products. These problems may translate into consolidation among computer retailers this year, analysts said. **********''There is certainly going to be consolidation,'' Mr. Rothberg said. ''Tandy has done this, and some regional chains will be going and freeing up market share,'' he added. **********The Tandy Corporation said this week that it would unload its Incredible Universe chain and close some of its Computer City stores. **********''Consolidation makes all the sense in the world and the industry is certainly ripe for it,'' Mr. Rothberg said. **********More immediately, analysts said they were concerned about what would happen to retail stocks. **********''The disappointing news that we are getting today on names like CompUSA is just the tip of the iceberg,'' Mr. Buchanan of NatWest said. ''We are going to get further disappointments in earnings. We think the group is locked into a bear market for a couple of years.'' **********To reinterest investors, he added, ''there has to be a reduction in industry capacity and an improvement in shopper demand. Both of those things are not going to happen overnight.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/18/business/monitor-radio-operation-to-end.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-04-18", "snippet": "Church of Christ, Scientist has put most of its broadcast operations up for sale and will end Monitor Radio, its money-losing news and public affairs broadcast arm, this summer (S)", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Monitor Radio Operation to End", "print_headline": "Monitor Radio Operation to End", "body_text": " **********The Church of Christ, Scientist has put most of its broadcast operations up for sale and will end Monitor Radio, its money-losing news and public affairs broadcast arm, this summer to focus its finances on its ministry. **********The sale was apparently forced by increased competition for financing and for customers on public radio, which has recently added broadcasts from the British Broadcasting Corporation and other public affairs programs like ''The World,'' which is produced by Public Radio International, or P.R.I. **********P.R.I. also distributes Monitor Radio to about 200 public radio stations.

By placing big bets on new aircraft and paying close attention to research and engineering, it has grown to dominate its industry by a wide margin. When it has tried to diversify outside the notoriously volatile aircraft industry, though, it has a remarkable history of missing the mark. **********Through the years, the Boeing Company has made everything from windmills and hydrofoils to rail cars and computer-controlled buses. In its early days, it even tried making furniture. And while most of these ventures were considered technical successes, they all drained cash until the company shut them down. **********Now, undeterred, Boeing is breaking out into new areas again. But there is a difference this time: The company finally appears to have learned from its mistakes. In recent months, the Seattle-based Boeing has announced a number of new ventures -- such as selling corporate jets and training pilots -- that suggest that it has decided to stay close to its aerospace roots. **********''Boeing has learned that if it reaches too far afield, it gets burned,'' said Wolfgang H. Demisch, an aerospace analyst at BT Securities. ''So it is trying to somehow extend its presence by building on its existing franchises.'' **********More is at stake than simply erasing Boeing's dubious record in sideline businesses. For one, the new ventures, if successful, can help smooth out the cyclical swings that have long buffeted Boeing's stock price and the size of its work force. **********That search for balance was a big reason Boeing announced last December its intention to acquire the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, whose strength in military contracting should complement Boeing's commercial aircraft business. But that deal, scheduled to be completed early next month, has encountered sharp criticism from the European Union, which has threatened to oppose the merger tomorrow in its final ruling unless Boeing accepts severe restrictions on its operations. The Clinton Administration has signaled that it may retaliate if the European Union decides to impose stiff fines on Boeing. **********For all its problems with European regulators, Boeing has another kind of problem -- the kind any company would love to have. It expects to generate such hefty profits in coming years that it will be forced to find new uses for all the cash. Yesterday, it reported second-quarter net income of $334 million on revenues of $9.29 billion. The results were short of analysts' expectations, and the stock fell $1.6875, closing at $54.375. But that is probably just a blip on the radar. And this time, Boeing is not waiting to start searching for new businesses only after aircraft orders have slumped and it is struggling to keep its workers busy. **********''That is a significant difference between the past and where we are today,'' said Lawrence W. Clarkson, president of Boeing Enterprises, a division created in January to seek out and manage new ventures. **********Boeing, for example, is now in the corporate jet business. The idea grew out of conversations between Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman, and John F. Welch, chairman of the General Electric Company, a big supplier of engines to Boeing as well as a big buyer of jets for its aircraft leasing division. **********According to Boeing executives, Mr. Welch had already committed to buying two 737's for corporate use, but mentioned to Mr. Condit that they still lacked the range of traditional, smaller corporate jets. **********Boeing then set 100 engineers to work designing a 737 with the most modern wings and bigger fuel tanks to get its range above 6,000 miles. Offered this new capability, Mr. Welch immediately switched his order to the new version and, convinced such a plane would appeal to other executives, joined Boeing as a partner to start Boeing Business Jets. The planes, at about $38 million to $40 million each, are approximately the same price as the smaller, top-of-the-line corporate jets made by Gulfstream and Bombardier. **********At a news conference last year to announce the venture, Boeing officials had planned to say they expected to sell six to eight business jets a year, but Mr. Welch persuaded them to push the estimate to 10 a year. None of them were right. In the first year, Boeing has taken orders for 20 corporate jets, including one from the golfer Greg Norman, whom Boeing has signed up as a pitchman to help sell the planes. **********Perhaps the strongest validation of the new market for large corporate jets came from Boeing's biggest rival, Airbus Industrie, which announced last month that it, too, would start selling a modified version of its A319 as a corporate jet. **********In January, Boeing Business Jets was folded into the new Boeing Enterprises division, which has moved quickly into other ventures. In March, it joined forces with Flightsafety International, a company acquired last year by the investor Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to train commercial-jet pilots. And in May, Boeing Enterprises agreed to a joint venture with Aero Vodochody, a Czech manufacturer of military jet fighters. **********Mr. Clarkson said Boeing Enterprises was considering a number of other businesses. One is heavy maintenance of aircraft, work that many airlines prefer to farm out to subcontractors. If it proceeds with that idea, Boeing may find itself competing against some of its airline customers. Lufthansa, for example, handles heavy maintenance for more than 100 airlines. Lufthansa said it did not see Boeing conflicting with its interests unless Boeing went after some of its maintenance clients. **********Other possibilities, Boeing Enterprises executives say, include managing the installation of aircraft interiors, an increasingly complex task because of the growing sophistication of in-flight video and audio systems. **********Boeing officials declined to predict how much revenue Boeing Enterprises may generate in coming years. But Nicholas Heymann, an aerospace analyst at Prudential Securities, has estimated that Boeing Enterprises could take in $5 billion by 2000, with operating profit margins of about 20 to 25 percent. He also predicted that the division would grow 8 to 10 percent a year. **********Boeing officials said two overarching criteria would guide Boeing Enterprises' expansion into new areas: It must know at least something about the products and their customers. **********As sensible as that strategy sounds, Boeing is nevertheless adding to the challenges it faces in coming years, particularly in trying to absorb McDonnell Douglas into its corporate culture. **********''The jury is still out on whether they are overreaching themselves in other business,'' Mr. Demisch said. ''What they are attempting is pretty ambitious.'' **********For all the challenges of the corporate strategy, though, one thing is clear: Boeing will leave behind fewer curiosities for historians. When the aircraft industry slumped in 1918 after the end of World War I, for example, Boeing tried to augment its modest plane-building business by making flat-bottomed boats called sea sleds and furniture like dressers and phonograph cases. **********Boeing had hoped to sell the boats to the Navy, but they eventually wound up in the hands of private owners who bought them at a discount. And Boeing's own employees bought much of the furniture at clearance prices. According to ''Legend and Legacy,'' a history of Boeing by Robert J. Serling, the company sent out a notice to employees that included this sales pitch: ''P.S. If you have delayed getting married on account of the high price of furniture, now is the time to get a good start.'' **********The next big push to diversify came after World War II, when Boeing's production lines for bombers were almost shut down. It considered getting into the car and household appliance businesses, but Boeing executives determined that that would be too much of a stretch even for them. The company tried the turbine engine business instead. **********In the late 1960's, when business was so slow that Boeing at one point went 18 months without getting a single aircraft order, the company branched into a wide variety of businesses. It built passenger and military hydrofoils, wind-powered turbines, public transit equipment, even police radio scramblers. At one point, Boeing was planting and selling potatoes as part of an irrigation experiment. **********Boeing officials said at the time that their goal was to have a third of the company's revenue coming from nontraditional areas by 1980. ''We are going to respond to social needs,'' a Boeing official told Time magazine in 1971. ''If we do not, we will be a limited company.'' **********But as demand picked up for planes, particularly with airline deregulation in 1978, Boeing eventually left all these businesses to focus on the products and customers it knew best. In the process, it became a far  narrower company, although a far more prosperous one than if it had continued pouring money into extraneous ventures. **********Since then, Boeing has gone through a fundamental change, and has come to see itself as an aerospace company, rather than a company with engineering prowess that can be applied to just about anything. **********One former Boeing executive who was involved in many past diversification efforts, John H. Goldie, summed up Boeing's mistakes in ''Legend and Legacy,'' although his words serve as a warning to all companies: **********''Boeing never had a strategy to diversify in any intelligent way,'' Mr. Goldie said. ''It gets into these things on an ad hoc basis. Somebody promotes an idea and if he's reasonably capable, it'll work. But if the guy's an idiot and doesn't do any market research, it'll be a disaster.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/14/business/hughes-plans-to-introduce-satellite-dish.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Sorkin", "pub_date": "1997-07-14", "snippet": "Hughes Network Systems to introduce digital satellite system that will be able to receive both television broadcasts and high-speed Internet access through one dish (S)", "word_count": 147, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hughes Plans To Introduce Satellite Dish", "print_headline": "Hughes Plans To Introduce Satellite Dish", "body_text": " **********Hughes Network Systems -- which manufactures a ''pizza size'' home satellite dish, Digital Satellite System, that receives DirecTV and USSB digital television -- is expected to announce today that it will introduce a digital satellite system that will be able to receive both television broadcasts and high-speed Internet access through one dish. **********The new dish, Direcduo, is the first of its kind and is expected to be priced between $899 and $999.

Mr. Kenee, who distrusts human security guards, said word of the snakes' presence had spread so rapidly that the deterrent effect had been magnified. **********''My domestic is still talking about it,'' he said. ''He slept every night with his door shut and hessian sacks stuffed under it.'' **********The Government is not sure how it feels about this.

He also disputed Mr. Vermeulen's claim to a herpetology degree. **********Mr. Vermeulen strongly disagreed about the moving of cobras, saying a new abode every 7 to 14 days would not upset them and offering to let regulators check his snakes and mortality rates anytime. **********''I don't want to get into a wrangle with them,'' he said. ''But there's hardly any stress at all. They curl up on a carpet and go to sleep.'' **********On the matter of his degree, he is rather shaky.

Still, they are enough to give hope to Joseph Jett, a pariah on Wall Street. **********Month after month, the former superstar bond trader at Kidder, Peabody & Company has tediously sorted through 429 boxes of documents, computer records and tapes, trying to refute accusations that he engineered an astounding $339 million in phony profits. Between odd jobs on construction sites and making deliveries -- and occasionally investing on others' behalf -- Mr. Jett has acted as his own paralegal, rummaging for anything that might clear his name. **********Now Mr. Jett's melancholy but tenacious three-year struggle is nearing an end. With an administrative law judge's ruling expected in the next few months, Mr. Jett will be certified as either one of Wall Street's great scoundrels or one of its most vilified scapegoats. **********As he awaits the ruling -- on a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint against him -- Mr. Jett and his lawyers offer up the scribblings of his former colleagues as confirmation that Kidder officials knew all about his trading strategies. And in some finger-pointing of their own, he and his lawyers cite cryptic recorded conversations as evidence that top officials urged him to help deceive General Electric, Kidder's parent at the time. **********Considering the intensity of his public shaming when he was dismissed in April 1994, Mr. Jett has been able to mount a remarkably vigorous defense. Just before Christmas, a securities arbitration panel awarded him $1 million of his Kidder bonuses after ruling that the firm was unable to prove he engaged in ''fraud, breach of duty and unjust enrichment.'' **********The arbitration hearing and a trial last summer on the S.E.C. accusations have produced a mass of intriguing documents and sworn testimony, while subsequent interviews have filled in some gaps. At the least, the evidence adds up to an extraordinary chronicle of negligence  by Kidder officials who were supposed to supervise Mr. Jett but missed one opportunity after another to halt his trading. Instead, they happily allowed his trading and generously rewarded it. Dozens of people were aware of a central component of his strategy, but no one, either out of ignorance or worse, objected to it as being based on an outright fiction. **********Some former colleagues of Mr. Jett suspect that the firm turned a blind eye  because of an eagerness to breed star traders, and to impress G.E., which in 1994 finally sold the firm out of disgust. **********After an internal investigation, a humiliated Kidder and G.E. acknowledged intolerable lapses of supervision. But whether Kidder officials countenanced Mr. Jett's activities, explicitly or tacitly, remains an issue -- one that may only be settled when a judge decides whether to fine him $20 million and expel him for life from the securities industry, as the S.E.C. has requested. **********Until then, questions persist: Can Mr. Jett be guilty of fraud if he hid nothing, falsified no records and was subject to several levels of oversight? Did Mr. Jett know full well that his trades were nothing more than make-believe? Or did he naively believe that the profits his computer reported had to be real? ''They accuse me of fraud, but there is so much evidence that I was open and honest and that other people looked at and understood my positions,'' said Mr. Jett, who contends he was singled out for blame to insulate G.E. from shareholder lawsuits. **********Kidder and the S.E.C. say Mr. Jett, through manipulative trading practices and by lying to management, concealed a computer accounting glitch that allowed him to report unearned profits. So illogical was Mr. Jett's trading, the S.E.C. maintains, that there is ''no conceivable explanation other than fraud.'' **********Yet some former Kidder employees furnish another explanation -- that a relatively inexperienced Mr. Jett, now 39, truly believed the profit figures that flashed on his computer terminal. ''I think Joe was someone who had a tremendous psychological need to be a star trader,'' said a former top Kidder executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''It was like a lab rat in a cage. He pushed the lever, and food came out. The rat doesn't give much thought to why the food came out.'' **********Superman Trader **********A Sputtering Career Finds a Vehicle **********When Mr. Jett arrived at Kidder in 1991, he badly needed to succeed. He had already been laid off from one Wall Street firm and dismissed from another, after abandoning a first career in chemical engineering. **********Not the best start for someone with an M.B.A. from Harvard and an engineering degree from M.I.T. Now he needed to draw on a reservoir of self-reliance and discipline. His father, one of the first blacks to command white troops in the Korean War as an Army sergeant, had drilled those qualities into him when he was growing up in Wickliffe, Ohio, outside Cleveland. **********Despite his previous missteps on Wall Street, Mr. Jett was an attractive prospect for Kidder. As an engineer, he would be adept at quantitative trading techniques, and G.E. was pressing Kidder managers to bring more members of minorities into senior positions. **********Mr. Jett, who described himself as opposed to racial preferences just as his father had been, said the trading desk was the meritocracy he desired. Traders' profits and losses are tallied daily, and they are the only score that counts. **********Mr. Jett's new boss, Edward Cerullo, had a reputation for being steely and ambitious. Fortunately for Mr. Jett, his boss took risks, both with money and with people. He had nurtured some outstanding young traders, making the fixed-income department a powerhouse that accounted for nearly all of Kidder's profits. G.E. liked the money Mr. Cerullo's department was earning, but worried that it was too dependent on the volatile mortgage bond market. Kidder needed to develop other lines of business. **********To Mr. Cerullo, former colleagues say, an instinctive solution was to find the next hot talent. ''Ed was absolutely a believer in Superman traders,'' a former trader at Kidder said. ''Just because no one else could make money in a certain market doesn't mean that a Superman couldn't.'' **********At first, Mr. Cerullo assigned Mr. Jett to the sleepy zero-coupon bond desk, under the wing of Melvin Mullin, a former college math teacher and the chief of Kidder's Government bond business. He taught Mr. Jett how to scan the market to buy bonds cheap and sell them dear, using a Mullin-designed computer system known as the Government Trader. One trick was to sometimes squeeze profits from the minor price differences between zero-coupon bonds and regular Government bonds. **********This is possible because of the way the Federal Reserve creates zero-coupon bonds. It takes a regular 30-year bond, which pays interest every six months, and ''strips'' it into as many as 61 separate securities, or zeros. One zero-coupon bond corresponds to the final principal payment, and up to 60 zeros correspond to each semiannual interest payment; investors are entitled to a single payment at maturity. **********If demand is higher for zeros than for  regular Government bonds, a trader can buy a bond, then have the Fed strip it and sell the pieces for more. If demand for zeros is lower, the trader can buy all the pieces and ''reconstitute'' them at the Fed into the original bond. Mr. Mullin's computer system was constantly searching for money-making possibilities in stripping or reconstituting bonds. **********During Mr. Jett's first five months on the job, he made only $417,000 for the firm, far less than the relatively modest goal of $1 million a month that Mr. Mullin had set for him. In October 1991, Kidder gave Mr. Jett his first bonus -- a paltry $5,000. The message was unmistakable: shape up or get out. **********In short order, Mr. Jett's profits started to escalate. In the first 10 months of 1992, he reported trading profits of $28 million. Mr. Jett was awarded a bonus of $2 million. **********At the time, Mr. Mullin now explains, Mr. Jett's turnaround seemed to make sense. Mr. Jett was a hard worker, he said, who often arrived at the office earlier and stayed later than his co-workers. **********Slowpoke Technology **********A Program Glitch, A Profit Mirage **********As Kidder now calculates it, $17 million of Mr. Jett's $28 million in apparent profit was not from legitimate trades but solely from a glitch in the way its computer system processed the stripping and reconstituting of bonds. **********With the flickering, touch-sensitive computer screens, Mr. Mullin's Government Trader system appeared to be at the vanguard of Wall Street's high-technology revolution. In reality, it was a silicon veneer over a patchwork of archaic computer systems based on software written before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969. **********The computer systems didn't take well to Wall Street's new, more complex inventions, and that goes a long way toward explaining how the accounting on Mr. Jett's trades went awry. Although Kidder had long been working on a new system, it never finished the job. **********The process of stripping and reconstituting zeros was relatively simple by contemporary Wall Street standards. But Kidder's system was incapable of making dozens of zero-coupon bonds disappear in a reconstitution and then making a conventional bond materialize in their place, or vice versa. **********So Kidder's programmers treated any exchange of zeros for conventional bonds as a sale and a purchase. Although no cash ever changed hands, the shortcut required entering an equivalent ''price'' for each side of the trade. **********This artifice might have remained forever unnoticed, and harmless, if it hadn't been for a seemingly minor mistake: Mr. Mullin allowed strips and reconstitutions to be settled up to five days in the future. **********Such forward trades are normal procedure in much of the Government bond market, including zero-coupon bonds. But forwards don't exist for reconstitutions. After all, reconstitutions aren't really trades;  they are more like the exchange of four quarters for a dollar. Why arrange in advance to do that? **********Mr. Mullin said he did not know all that at the time. Even so, he still contends, scheduling reconstitutions in advance, as Kidder did, gave the firm's back office time to assemble the strips it needed to carry out the transaction. **********The method of accounting for profits was another matter. On Wall Street, forward trades are firm commitments, so investment firms start keeping track of profits or losses on them right away. **********With its makeshift system, Kidder was doing just that with Mr. Jett's reconstitutions, recording profits on the day he entered them that would vanish by the time the trade was settled. **********The heart of the problem is that conventional bonds stay even in price as long as interest rates are stable, while zeros go up every day, with daily interest earnings built into the price. **********The moment Mr. Jett entered into a reconstitution that would be settled several days in the future, the computer would immediately calculate the transaction as being profitable. That was an error, and it came about because the strips could be bought in the open market on that day for less than they were scheduled to be sold for when the transaction settled -- after interest had a chance to accrue. **********In a reconstitution scheduled to be settled in five days, for example, the difference between the two prices was equal to five days of interest. That profit, however, was ephemeral. The next day, the computer would record a profit from the very same transaction equal to only four days of interest. By the time the transaction settled, the supposed profit would disappear, as if it had never existed. **********But Mr. Jett kept entering into more reconstitutions. As a result, the firm credited him with ever increasing profits. **********In October 1992, the Government Trader system was upgraded with a new generation of software and a more powerful computer. One improvement was the ability to arrange trades that would be settled well beyond the five-day limit, allowing them to be concluded months into the future. **********Kidder said Mr. Jett had requested the change to further his fraud; he said others asked for the change, too. In any case, it proved to be a bonanza. He set the settlement dates for his reconstitutions even farther into the future; the farther off, the greater the profit the firm recorded on his behalf when the transaction was first arranged. **********On Nov. 17, 1992, Mr. Jett tapped on the screen to reconstitute $200 million of bonds 203 days ahead -- on June 8, 1993. That produced an immediate profit of $12 million. Mr. Jett said that was the first time he noticed the big profits to be had from forward reconstitutions, and he sought an explanation from Moshe Benetar, a programmer who helped design the Government Trader system. By Mr. Benetar's own account in an interview, he responded that the system was supposed to work that way. **********Throughout 1993, Mr. Jett entered an escalating series of forward reconstitutions. These trades were used, the S.E.C. said, to generate ''more false profits when his real trading lost money.'' **********From March 1993 through the end of the year, Mr. Jett earned no less than $10 million a month for the company. And when Mr. Mullin moved on to another assignment, Mr. Jett took his place supervising all government bond trading. By the end of 1993, Mr. Jett was made a managing director of Kidder, Peabody, named its ''man of the year'' and awarded $9 million in bonuses on $150 million in reported trading profits. **********Half-Hearted Inquiries **********Easy Answers, Easy Acceptance **********On Kidder's trading floor, there was more than a little curiosity about how Mr. Jett seemed to mint money. Traders who could track his trading with customers -- as opposed to his reconstitutions with the Fed -- figured that his business couldn't be all that profitable. **********In an interview, Mr. Mullin said that long after he had switched jobs and Mr. Jett was no longer his responsibility, he nonetheless  casually asked Barry Finer, the risk manager in the fixed-income division, how Mr. Jett was making money. ''Barry said he has a big bet on the shape of the yield curve'' -- the gap between short-term and long-term interest rates, Mr. Mullin said. **********''I said we don't do that,'' Mr. Mullin recalled. ''And Barry said, 'Jett can do anything he wants.' '' Mr. Finer declined to comment. **********Among those raising concerns were some people on the repurchase desk, which was responsible for helping Mr. Jett assemble all the zero-coupon bonds he needed to carry out reconstitutions, often borrowing them from other firms. But the repurchase desk could hardly keep up with the pace set by Mr. Jett. Handicapped by Kidder's ancient computers, it resorted to using a heavy red appointment calendar to keep track. **********Mr. Jett now cites the appointment book as evidence that he did not hide his trading strategy. Notations were made for thousands of strips and reconstitution trades to be settled weeks and months into the future, even though, as much of Wall Street knew, the Fed didn't engage in such forward trades. By at least one Kidder executive's account, as many as 100 people referred to the appointment book or were otherwise involved in the forward reconstitutions. **********James Rizzi, a trader on the repurchase desk who was in charge of strips, raised an alarm in 1993 with David Bernstein, an accountant who functioned as chief of staff to Mr. Cerullo. But Mr. Rizzi said he was waved off. **********''Since we were not settling any money, my concern was that they were paper trades,'' Mr. Rizzi testified at the S.E.C.'s fraud trial. Mr. Bernstein, according to Mr. Rizzi's testimony, responded that ''he was sure these were not just paper transactions.'' **********Mr. Rizzi's concerns were not allayed. So his boss, Brian Finkelstein, later took up the issue with Mr. Bernstein, raising the possibility that the recorded profits were ''an illusion,'' Mr. Finkelstein testified. When Mr. Bernstein again said the profits were real, Mr. Finkelstein suggested that Mr. Cerullo should be brought into the discussion. ''Ed already knows,'' Mr. Bernstein replied, according to Mr. Finkelstein's testimony. **********Mr. Bernstein recalled the conversation differently, contending that he said he knew of nothing wrong with Mr. Jett's trading and that he suggested to Mr. Finkelstein that he speak with Mr. Cerullo. **********As for Mr. Cerullo, he testified to knowing that Mr. Jett was active in reconstitutions and that Mr. Jett was engaging in forward trades. What he didn't know early on, he said, was that Mr. Jett was doing reconstitutions on a forward basis. **********Mr. Cerullo also said he, too, periodically made queries about Mr. Jett's trading, but not because he worried about fraud. Any rapid increase in profits, Mr. Cerullo testified, was a warning of too much risk-taking. At one point, Mr. Cerullo dispatched Mr. Finer, the risk manager, to check into one area of possible risk -- whether Mr. Jett was betting too heavily on interest rates. **********According to Mr. Finer's testimony, Mr. Jett told him the profits were from three roughly equal sources: trading with customers, stripping and reconstituting bonds, and trading to exploit discrepancies between the prices of bonds and bond futures. Mr. Finer never verified the numbers. **********''It wasn't my position to be satisfied or not'' with Mr. Jett's answers, Mr. Finer testified. ''I was asked to pose the questions. I posed the questions.'' **********Mr. Jett cites another exchange as tacit authorization for his trading approach and the way profits were being credited to him. **********In May 1993, he had a series of short meetings on the trading floor with Mr. Bernstein and Charles Fiumefreddo, a top accountant in the fixed-income division. The accountants, taking notice of Mr. Jett's forward trades, needed Mr. Jett's help in identifying them because such trades were supposed to be excluded from the firm's balance sheet. **********When asked, Mr. Jett said most of his forward trades were reconstitutions with the Fed. Although Mr. Bernstein said he was unaware that such transactions were a fiction, he did ask what would turn out to be the right question: Did Mr. Jett get credit for a profit he hadn't earned the moment he entered a forward reconstitution? Other types of forward trades had resulted in such accounting distortions in the past, so Mr. Bernstein thought Mr. Jett's trades might pose the same problem. **********Mr. Jett said he acknowledged an unearned profit on forward reconstitutions butargued that it was nothing more than advance credit for earnings on other transactions that were part of his broader strategy. **********Mr. Bernstein's account is different. He recalls that Mr. Jett said a reconstitution did not automatically create a profit. **********Yet shortly after Mr. Jett was dismissed, Mr. Bernstein's comments were more in line with Mr. Jett's version. According to notes taken by lawyers hired by Kidder to investigate the scandal, Mr. Bernstein said of the profits, ''We didn't view it as false, just accelerated.'' Mr. Bernstein says the quotation was taken out of context. **********As Mr. Jett describes it, the accounting executives ultimately fussed only about the need to account for the cost of financing the transactions. Still, no change was made in how profits were tallied because Kidder's accounting system couldn't accommodate one. **********After spending 400 hours reviewing Mr. Jett's zero-coupon desk in August and September 1993, Kidder's internal auditors did not do any better at detecting problems. They unquestioningly recorded that much of Mr. Jett's trading was in reconstitutions and that 20 to 40 percent of his desk's trading was on a forward basis. **********Paper Trades **********A Change in Rules, Then an Unraveling **********By the autumn of 1993, G.E. had begun to look with dismay at the size of Kidder's portfolio of bonds. The firm's assets had ballooned to 100 times its capital, and it was borrowing at more than twice the rate of any other firm on Wall Street. Worried about risks, G.E. ordered Kidder to cut back on its holdings, and it gave the firm three weeks to meet its target. **********Mr. Jett was told to reduce his combined bond holdings from $22 billion to $16 billion. Because of an accounting change, Mr. Jett's forward reconstitution trades now stuck out strikingly. **********If Mr. Jett had reduced his position in forward reconstitutions, he would have incurred a loss. He instead resorted to a complex series of forward trades that simultaneously preserved his profits and complied with Kidder's new balance-sheet restrictions. **********Mr. Jett and Kidder are now oddly in agreement that his new approach consisted entirely of paper trades, with the sole purpose of manipulating Kidder's financial statements. ''We no longer had a profit motive,'' Mr. Jett said. ''The trades became more and more a massive juggling act.'' **********Mr. Jett says he was ordered by Kidder to engage in the trading to deceive G.E. The S.E.C. contends that Mr. Jett desperately sought to keep a fraudulent scheme from being detected by Kidder management. The evidence on the issue is ambiguous. **********Mr. Jett's lawyers point to tapes of telephone calls in which Mr. Bernstein instructed Mr. Jett on how to use forward strip trades to ''window dress'' Kidder's balance sheet. Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Jett talked about ''pairing off'' and ''rolling forward'' strips and reconstitution trades so they never actually settled with the Federal Reserve. **********''We do our best not to call attention to, ah, you know, the stuff in the strips book, but just for my security going forward, you know, get the stuff done,'' Mr. Bernstein said in a December telephone call, taped as part of Kidder's routine recording of traders' conversations. A month later, Mr. Bernstein told Mr. Jett that ''there's been such volume on pairing off these forwards that it really is, you've gotten conspicuous.'' **********Mr. Bernstein testified that he did not understand why Mr. Jett was conducting these trades. He said he just became concerned that the maneuvers did not work perfectly, with the effect that the value of his portfolio periodically shot up by a thoroughly unacceptable $25 billion. **********In January 1994 Mr. Jett's reported profits doubled, and Mr. Cerullo asked Mr. Bernstein to investigate whether Mr. Jett was taking too much risk. One weekend, reviewing the books while attending his son's diving match, Mr. Bernstein discovered $42 billion in forward reconstitutions, far more than the firm could ever expect to settle. It took a few more weeks before Mr. Bernstein determined that the forward reconstitutions -- reflecting the residue of months and months of Mr. Jett's trading strategies -- were crediting Mr. Jett with a cumulative profit of more than $300 million. **********That set off a frantic series of conversations between Kidder managers and Mr. Jett. After a series of conflicting explanations, Mr. Cerullo testified, Mr. Jett acknowledged in April 1994 that in the previous six months his forward reconstitutions resulted in fake profits. **********''I became nauseous,'' Mr. Cerullo testified. A few days later, Kidder hired Gary Lynch, a former S.E.C. enforcement chief, to investigate. When Mr. Jett did not appear for an interview with Mr. Lynch, he was immediately dismissed. Mr. Jett said a social engagement kept him from the interview. **********Costly Lessons **********Unjustly Vilified Or Justly Punished? **********Mr. Jett describes the last three years as ''a hellish ordeal'' in which he was ''lynched on the front page.'' **********G.E. blamed him for a $350 million charge to earnings. Mr. Lynch, in concluding his formal investigation for Kidder, accused Mr. Jett of deliberately manipulating Kidder's systems. He was grilled dozens of times by Federal prosecutors, though criminal charges have not been filed. The S.E.C. filed its fraud complaint in January 1996. **********''I have not been able to work in my chosen field,'' Mr. Jett said. ''The hardest part of the last three years was realizing I was alone. The people who were in a position to speak the truth were not going to come forward.'' **********He seethes that Kidder has made severance payments to all of his superiors and covered the legal bills for everyone but him. **********Last year, Mr. Cerullo settled the S.E.C. charge of failing to supervise Mr. Jett; Mr. Cerullo paid a $50,000 fine and was suspended from the securities industry for a year. Kidder paid him $9 million in deferred compensation and severance. Mr. Mullin settled for $25,000 and suspension for three months. Mr. Bernstein, who was never accused of any wrongdoing, was reassigned by Kidder when Mr. Jett was dismissed and is now a consultant. **********Even when Mr. Jett's trading earned him lavish bonuses, his life style did not always reflect it. For a long while, his apartment was furnished only with a bed, a stereo and a weight set. After his dismissal from Kidder, with practically all his savings frozen in a Kidder account, self-denial became a necessity. He lived nomadically, staying with friends. **********With the arbitration panel's award of $1 million in bonus money, Mr. Jett's situation has improved considerably. He has bought new clothes and a cellular phone. He has rented an apartment in the East Village and intends to start a private investment fund.  He is also writing a book and hopes to sell his story to Hollywood. **********All of this assumes he has a future in the securities business, a safe assumption in his view. For all he and his lawyers have uncovered about how much others at Kidder knew about his trading, his chief point is that it was not his responsibility to question profits being credited to him by Kidder's computers. **********''If I am operating under their system to generate profits, with their approval,'' Mr. Jett asked, ''and they turn around and change the rules so the reasons you had for doing this no longer exist -- and, by the way, we are taking all the money back we paid you -- is that fair?'' **********Mr. Lynch, however, argues that exploiting a dysfunctional system can indeed constitute fraud. ''It is like receiving a hundred paychecks each week when you should get one,'' he said. ''It's not a defense to say, 'I assumed the company meant to pay me a hundred times.' '' **********That defense, however, did sway many of the 500 graduate business students at New York University who gathered one evening last fall to hear Mr. Jett unabashedly discuss his case. So, was his story an object lesson to a future generation of financiers eager to avoid the same fate? Not really. William Starbuck, the professor who invited Mr. Jett, said ''the overwhelming majority''  felt that Kidder and G.E. ''had implicitly defined a game by setting up their accounting system.'' **********In the students' view, Dr. Starbuck said,  ''it is the job of employees to play the game, not to decide whether they are good games or bad games.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/10/business/tax-proposal-offers-wall-st-some-relief.html": {"writer_name": "David Johnston", "pub_date": "1997-06-10", "snippet": "US House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Repr Bill Archer puts forth wide-ranging tax plan, and his proposals contain some relief that would be welcome on Wall Street: phasing out corporate alternative minimum tax, reducing capital gains for mid...", "word_count": 630, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tax Proposal Offers Wall St. Some Relief", "print_headline": "Tax Proposal Offers Wall St. Some Relief", "body_text": " **********For Wall Street it could have been a lot worse. **********The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Representative Bill Archer of Texas, put forth a wide-ranging tax plan yesterday, and his proposals contained some relief that would be welcome on Wall Street: phasing out the corporate alternative minimum tax, reducing capital gains for middle-  and lower- income investors, expanding the use of independent contractors instead of employees and continuing tax preferences for both 100-year bonds and for stock options. **********But there were also a few bitter pills scattered among the proposals by Mr. Archer, the chief Republican tax writer. **********Potentially the most painful proposal would require companies to register tax shelters with the Government. That would alert Internal Revenue Service auditors in advance to creative new tax avoidance strategies, whereas now they have to hope to find them after the fact. **********The rest of the bad news was mostly limited to proposals to tighten or eliminate tax gimmicks, such as a device by which investors in credit card debt could delay reporting December interest income until the next year. **********The biggest dollars are in Mr. Archer's proposal to phase out the alternative minimum tax for corporations by the start of the year 2006, which would cost the Government $33.9 billion in reduced taxes over the next 10 years if enacted. **********''I am sure he will have a very tough time with that one,'' said Robert Willens, a tax specialist at Lehman Brothers. **********Mr. Archer also proposed eliminating the alternative minimum tax for small companies, but he proposed to keep it for individuals with some adjustments for inflation. **********Mr. Archer also proposed a slight reining in of the Morris Trust, a device that allows for tax-free spinoffs of companies. The device is called a Morris Trust after a taxpayer who won a case allowing a 1966 tax-free spinoff. **********A likely spark for the proposed changes, Mr. Willens said, was a May 19 deal in which the E. W. Scripps Company said it would buy six newspapers and two broadcast stations from Harte-Hanks Communications, paying as much as $625 million if the Morris Trust is preserved and $775 million if it is not. **********''I suspect the tax writers looked at that and said to themselves, 'There's $150 million we can pick up in just that one deal,' '' Mr. Willens said. **********Mr. Willens said at least $50 billion of deals involved Morris Trusts in the last year, but Mr. Archer's proposal is so modest that it is estimated to raise only $2 billion over 10 years. **********Mr. Willens also predicted that Mr. Archer's proposal to end shorting against the box, a tax avoidance strategy that involves selling borrowed shares of stock while retaining one's own shares, might not produce the $1.2 billion of added tax revenue over 10 years that Mr. Archer predicts. The reason is that many people might shift to borrowing against their shares and a tax rule would then allow them to deduct the interest they pay, provided that they have interest income from other investments. **********Many executives will breathe easier knowing that Mr. Archer has taken the tax treatment of stock options off the table. Options create a tax deduction for companies without a cash outlay, a major reason that companies are expanding them as a form of payment not just for executives but for the rank-and-file as well. The cost of options is borne by existing shareholders, whose ownership stake is diluted. **********Cyclical industries like steel and autos would face only a slight reduction in their ability to use net operating losses to reduce income taxes in profitable years. Currently companies can use losses to offset profits in three prior years and then carry any unused losses forward for 15 years.  Mr. Archer proposed two years back and 20 forward, which he estimated would raise $1.8 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/business/company-news-casino-companies-agree-to-be-acquired-for-304-million.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-09-18", "snippet": "R & E Gaming Corp will buy Elsinore Corp for about $54 million and Riviera Holdings Corp for about $250 million (S)", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CASINO COMPANIES AGREE TO BE ACQUIRED FOR $304 MILLION", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; CASINO COMPANIES AGREE TO BE ACQUIRED FOR $304 MILLION", "body_text": " **********Two Las Vegas casino companies have agreed to be acquired by the R & E Gaming Corporation, a company owned by Allen E.

In a Congress dominated by those sympathetic to corporate interests, controlling workplace hazards gets short shrift. The trend is toward ''regulatory relief'' and the imposition of risk-assessment strategies that value corporate profits more than the lives of working people. **********The ability of OSHA to develop standards and adequately enforce them is under attack.

Rates of occupational disease have also declined because of regulation -- though less so. **********It's time to stem the tide of deregulation and put workers' health and safety first on the agenda. **********FRANCESCA RHEANNON **********Springfield, Mass., Dec. 22 **********The writer is program director of the Western Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/18/business/even-action-heroes-can-find-themselves-foiled-by-the-gadgets-they-confront.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Rothstein", "pub_date": "1997-08-18", "snippet": "Edward Rothstein article on managing technological failures as theme in Air Force One and other films; drawing (M)", "word_count": 892, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Even action heroes can find themselves foiled by the gadgets they confront.", "print_headline": "Even action heroes can find themselves foiled by the gadgets they confront.", "body_text": " **********THE popular success of the movie ''Air Force One'' might seem related to its outrageously appealing and impossible fantasy: Here is an American President who advocates both high moral principle and unabashed use of American power, who is both a family man and a heart-throb, who can hang from a rope dangling from an airplane like a superhero yet loves ordinary football so much he'll watch a game on videotape even after hearing the final score. **********But no, the great appeal of Harrison Ford in the role of a hijacked, kidnapped, jetlagged President does not lie in his many abilities to use automatic weaponry or his knowledge of the computerized navigation system of Air Force One. He is so compelling because for all his specialized training as certified action hero, he has to consult a manual to get a cellular phone to work and then, at a particularly crucial moment in his negotiations for survival, the battery goes dead. **********This is the real proof that he is one of us, a victim of technological pretense and promise, having to plow through unreadable text while being unable to depend on the results. (Does anybody believe that his battery lasted as long as the manual promised?) Technology may even turn out to be a burden, not a tool, best borne with Mr. Ford's trademark irony and a bit of a grin; it is, at any rate, far less reliable than a good old piece of jagged glass that can cut through bonds. **********Admittedly, some technological marvels still work in this film: The Air Force tracking system seems satisfactory; so does the plane's public address system. There is even a teasing promise of technological invulnerability in the opening scenes in which a commando group uses lasers and explosives with almost virtuosic mastery. **********But the high-technology security system that checks fingerprints against Washington's data base? The higher-technology protection of the nation's most important airplane? They have as much reliability as a cell phone. The President even has to resort to cutting wire with a dull-edged butter knife. **********We are all acquainted with a real-world counterpart to such failings in the problems that have plagued the Mir space station. These have included not only high-technology mishaps, but such mundane accidents as the crew pulling the wrong plug and losing electrical power. **********Managing technology's failings ends up more important than the technology itself. **********That is also what we learned when defeating the all-powerful aliens in last summer's fantasy movie, ''Independence Day.'' Humans were weaker than the aliens, less technologically advanced, and -- at least in that film -- burdened with almost embarrassing ethnic and racial stereotypes. But humans had one thing the aliens didn't: computers that fail. **********By now it will not be giving away any trade secrets to note that the heroes of ''Independence Day'' -- including another President with a complement of unusual combat abilities -- repelled the invaders the same way that the hapless earthlings did by accident in H. G. Wells's ''War of the Worlds'': with a virus. **********A similar view of technology is behind the mythic power of the ''Star Wars'' saga. The most effective technology in the popular cycle of films all belongs to the bad guys with their gleaming ships and high-powered weaponry. The good guys must make do with a beat-up spaceship with dangling wiring and two androids that always seem to be at the point of turning into mounds of scrap metal. The heroes' greatest powers lie in a nontechnological knowledge that is far more ancient than the Empire's Death Star. For the ''Star Wars'' heroes, the past was far more important than the future. **********There is a long tradition of this interplay between the lure of high technology and its almost human Achilles' heel. We are lured by the promise of new technologies just as the heroes initially are. The flashing lights, the sleek sliding doors, the fast-flying fingers programming intricate computers -- here, these technological marvels proclaim, is the paradise we have always yearned for, a utopia that may someday even produce a PC that works like an ordinary appliance. **********And then, like the heroes, we learn, almost too late, that cellular batteries don't last, that computers are primitive, that metal rusts. Forget the promises of new inventions and technological infallibility. Find something else to pin hopes on: martial arts, say, or fancy fist work, or Harrison Ford, or the Force. **********This is not really anti-technological fantasy; it still relies on the seductive appeal of high technology, the way James Bond relied on those gadgets that came out of Q's lab. It is more like ante-technological fantasy -- attempts to bring into the present the kind of world that existed before technology, relying on it as we move forward into a seductive world of invention. **********It is a fantasy that is also in opposition to the other major fantasy of our time, the ever-continuing hope that there really is a new kind of technology that really will permanently transform, unite and enlighten us. For many, that fantasy is embodied in the World Wide Web. **********In the meantime, on the ground in real time, we alternate between the two stances, approaching each innovation with ever greater hopes and ever greater skepticism. This time the battery will last, the flaws of humanity will be mastered, the future will be assured. Yes, of course.

It wants to pay them a higher rate of interest. **********G.M.'s proposal, announced this week, could cost the auto maker an additional $2.7 million a year in payments to investors. **********What's the catch? For the investor, there is none. The loser is Uncle Sam. For the newly offered securities would provide a tax break for General Motors. While it will pay investors more, it will end up at least $9 million richer after taxes. **********Such tactics have been available for years, but President Clinton has proposed closing that particular angle, and many expect Congress to include that proposal in this year's tax-cut bill. But it appears that the General Motors security would escape the Clinton bill because it is designed to fall at the edge of the arbitrary line set by President Clinton. **********In so doing, Merrill Lynch, which created the security for General Motors, illustrated the great difficulty for tax code writers in closing what they see as loopholes. New provisions in the tax code simply inspire new wrinkles on Wall Street. **********G.M. gets the tax break because while the new securities look and feel much like preferred stock -- the misleading name for the security is Trust Originated Preferred Securities -- they are actually counted as debt when General Motors files its tax return. And tax laws provide that interest paid on debt is deductible from a corporation's taxable income, while interest paid on preferred stock is not. **********Thanks to the unusual way the debt is structured, it will not show up as debt on General Motor's balance sheet. Instead, it will show up as a ''minority interest,'' a sort of semi-liability that usually appears when a subsidiary is only partly owned. **********And because G.M. will have a right to defer interest payments for up to five years, the bond rating agencies view such ''debt'' as being more like equity, and therefore give it little weight in deciding whether a given level of debt means a company's bond rating should be lowered. For G.M., the securities seem to be the best of both worlds -- the tax deduction of interest on debt with none of the negative balance sheet connotations of having too much debt. **********The Clinton proposal goes after that as follows: It provides that companies cannot deduct the interest as tax-deductible debt if the security is not shown as debt on the balance sheet and if its original maturity is at least 15 years. When it was proposed, that covered any such security, since they typically are issued with terms of 20 to 30 years. **********But the General Motors new security has a different tact. It is to be issued on July 2, and will mature on July 1, 2012. ''That's 14 years and 364 days,'' said Robert Willens, a tax expert at Lehman Brothers. ''This appears to be the first security of this type to be planned to come in under 15 years.'' **********The proposed effective date for the Clinton proposal is the date of the first action by a Congressional committee on the proposal, which could happen within the next few weeks. Other issues of similar securities this year have relied on getting in before the effective date, but it appears that General Motors was concerned about how long it would take to get an exchange offer done, and opted for the maturity provision. **********G.M. is actually offering two securities. In exchange for its Series D preferred, which pays an annual interest rate of 7.92 percent, it is offering a Series D Trust Originated Preferred Security paying an annual rate of 8.67 percent. For Series G preferred, which pays 9.12 percent a year, it is offering a Series G trust security, paying 9.87 percent. **********Because G.M. promised the original holders of the preferred that they would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, it is offering to acquire only 90 percent of both issues, thereby leaving enough outstanding to maintain the Big Board listing. **********For holders considering the exchange, one argument against doing it is that the exchange will be a taxable event, providing a capital gain based on the value of the new security compared with the original cost of the preferred for the investor. And while call provisions on the two are similar, the new security has a provision allowing it to be immediately paid off if Congress changes the tax law in a way that would take away the tax break for that security. Changing the maturity requirement in the Clinton proposal could accomplish that. **********And for any corporate holders of the preferred, an exchange would be unwise because they would lose the dividend received deduction that reduces their corporate income tax. That consideration does not apply to individual investors, who own most of these securities. **********Otherwise, this is a case of G.M. offering to pay more than it is now paying. Effectively, investors are being offered an extra three-quarters of a percentage point a year to give G.M. a tax savings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/01/world/in-a-poor-land-a-classic-swindle-leaves-rage-and-emptier-pockets.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1997-02-01", "snippet": "Albania, poorest country in Europe, is sorting out devastating consequences of flim-flam schemes that have cost tens of thousands of desperately poor people their tiny savings; pyramid schemes have flourished in former Communist countries, but esp...", "word_count": 1378, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In a Poor Land, a Classic Swindle Leaves Rage and Emptier Pockets", "print_headline": "In a Poor Land, a Classic Swindle Leaves Rage and Emptier Pockets", "body_text": " **********Life was hard enough for Shpresa Rinxhi before she and her husband  scraped together $500 and put it into one of the most dizzying of Albania's dream machines, a so-called charity foundation that was promising a quick 300 percent return on their money. **********Together with their three children, the Rinxhis (pronounced REEN-jee) live in one room in a former workers hostel, cooking their dinners on a stove in the corridor, sharing a bathroom with eight other families. On his $60 a month salary from a state-owned cement plant, and the $2 a day she earns at their fruit and vegetable stand, the couple saw the promises of a fund called Xhaferri (pronounced jah-FEH-ree) as their only chance for a better life. And so, like hundreds of thousands of other Albanians, they chose to believe. **********If they had any doubts, those were washed away by the arrival here last November of Rrapush Xhaferri himself, a former army officer who had paraded his wealth by sponsoring a Miss Albania contest and hiring a highly paid Brazilian coach for his local soccer team. **********''He told us, 'Don't be afraid. The water in the sea will dry up before I run out of money,' '' recalled Edward Prushi, 32, an unemployed gym teacher who himself entrusted Xhaferri with the $1,000 he had saved during a stint as a construction worker in Greece, only to see it disappear into the sink-hole of a classic pyramid scheme. **********Now Albania, the poorest country in Europe, which six years ago emerged from the almost total isolation imposed by a harsh Communist regime, is sorting out the devastating consequences of the latest series of flim-flam schemes to hit Eastern Europe in the post-Communist era. **********Other countries new to the wilds of free markets -- Romania, Russia and Bulgaria, among others -- have seen similar schemes preying on  gullibility, ignorance and desperation, leaving the clients dazzled by the novel dream of getting rich. **********But the pyramid schemes in Albania -- there were at least 10 by some accounts, the largest of which remain nominally in operation -- lasted longer than anywhere else, in some cases for two years. **********By most estimates, the amount taken in from Albanians by various pyramid schemes was almost $1 billion, roughly three times the size of the national budget deficit. The investment schemes have touched almost every family in Albania. **********The prolonged success of the  funds, and their ability in the short term to deliver on the most fantastic of promises, was what led even cautious Albanians to take a risk. **********''The only people who did not lose money were those who couldn't put their hands on any,'' said Mr. Prushi. ''There were people who sold their houses, others sold their cows, and now their children don't even have milk.'' **********Mrs. Rinxhi reached for the cigarettes she started smoking again when the crisis began, her eyes filling with tears. ''We are in a terrible situation,'' she said. ''It can't be worse.'' **********Today Mr. Xhaferri is in jail, his fund seized by the Government; Marta, the woman who ran the local Xhaferri office, collecting wads of leks -- the Albanian currency -- from people who spent hours waiting in line, has disappeared. And the people of Fushe-Kruja, a shabby, dusty town of 25,000, responded last weekend by joining the rest of the country in street demonstrations, which, in some places have turned into near-riots. **********Thrown on the defensive, the center-right Government of President Sali Berisha has promised to restore at least some of the missing money to the people on Nov. 5, to be distributed through savings account passbooks and options to bid on state property. The Government has also lashed out at its already feeble opposition and has blamed opponents for fomenting the violence last weekend. **********But here, where the demonstrations were peaceful, residents insist that the Government is to blame for the catastrophe that has befallen them. Like many others, they are waiting to see if President Berisha fulfills his promise. ''We want our money,'' said Mr. Prushi. ''We don't want pieces of paper.'' **********Fushe-Kruja, like many small towns in this nation of 3.5 million,  was a relative late-comer to the national craze, which by October of last year had reached frenzied levels. By then funds like Xhaferri were stepping up efforts to collect more money, opening new offices, promising ever higher rates of return over ever shorter periods of time -- all signs that the bubble was about to burst. **********But when Mr. Xhaferri came here, nobody really wanted to ask him hard questions, like how he could promise to triple their money in three months in a country with meager investments and 20 percent unemployment. **********''We didn't ask anything about him,'' said Mr. Prushi. ''People were getting their money, and that was enough for us.'' **********But the longevity of the schemes is also seen as evidence that the Albanian Government tolerated, perhaps even encouraged the funds, despite repeated warnings from inside and outside the country, from the governor of the central bank to the International Monetary Fund. **********President Berisha, at a news conference this week, denied any Government involvement, and wrote off Albania's early laissez-faire approach as a sign of its commitment to free-market capitalism. **********''In a free and democratic society,'' said the president, ''borrowing is one of the inalienable rights of human beings. The Government will never dictate when to lend, when to borrow.'' **********Whether the Government was complicit in the schemes is still unclear, but it is certain that Mr. Berisha's Democratic Party -- with the endorsements of some of the biggest funds -- won national elections last May in a vote that international observers said was tainted by ballot-rigging and intimidation, and local elections last October. ''Vote Democratic Party and everyone wins,'' was one slogan that implicitly linked the party's success with the survival of the pyramid schemes. **********By last October, a year after the I.M.F. first registered its concern about Albania's free-wheeling ''informal market,'' the warnings had become increasingly urgent. According to Western financial experts, the I.M.F., at its annual meeting in Washington, was urging the Albanian Government to take immediate action. **********Shortly afterwards, Finance Minister Ridvan Bode went on the Government-run television network to warn people that the Government might have to investigate the funds. But his warning was drowned out by assurances -- also broadcast on Albania's tightly controlled official networks -- by some of the top fund managers that there was nothing to worry about. **********In the same period, Mr. Berisha, answering accusations about the thriving arms and drugs traffic that has spilled across Albania's borders and which many believe has helped fuel the pyramid schemes, reassured the people that ''Albanian money was the cleanest in the world.'' To many, that sounded very much like the Government's seal of approval. **********''That made us very sure,'' sad Haxhire Kadiu, a neighbor of the Rinxhis. ''Since these funds were approved and licensed by the Government, we believed them. Otherwise, why didn't they do anything to stop them?'' **********As the schemes grew bigger and bigger, their effect on the economy became more and more dangerous. Not only were people investing the little money they had, but many began to live off the interest payments that they continued to get as recently as last November. **********The Government's paralysis was obvious to all. ''You don't stop pyramid schemes and put hungry people on the streets a month before elections,'' noted one Western diplomat. **********The first sign of collapse came in November when a fund run by a 30-year-old former shoe factory worker, a woman widely known as Sude the Gypsy, stopped making payments. **********On Nov. 26 the manager of a smaller fund vanished with $13 million. By mid-January, Sude had declared bankruptcy, triggering the first street demonstrations. On Jan. 26, the state seized the $255 million held in state banks by Xhaferri and another fund, Populli, just two weeks before most families in Fushe-Kruja were due to get their money back, including profits. **********But the unanswered question is what will happen next, particularly with some of the larger investment funds, which many believe the Government could bail out, at some cost to the economy. **********''There are other schemes out there that are not solvent, and that is a major concern,'' said a Western financial expert. ''The Government faces a very, very difficult problem in trying to minimize the damage.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/04/business/summit-gets-nyce-stake.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-04-04", "snippet": "Summit Bancorp buys equity stake in NYCE Corp, an automated teller machine network that links ATMs deployed by 1,300 banks, for undisclosed amount (S)", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Summit Gets NYCE Stake", "print_headline": "Summit Gets NYCE Stake", "body_text": " **********Summit Bancorp said today that it had bought an equity stake in the NYCE Corporation, the automated teller machine network that links A.T.M.'s  deployed by 1,300 banks, for an undisclosed amount.

As at Babi Yar, the notorious Nazi mass grave in Ukraine where Soviet authorities for decades refused to acknowledge that most of the victims were Jews, Salonika has been slow to recognize that its large and vibrant Jewish community was singled out for annihilation. **********''There was such an unbearable silence about the Jews of Salonika,'' said Andreas Sefiha, the 69-year-old president of the city's Jewish community, who as a boy of 13 had managed to escape the occupied city in 1943 before the trains started leaving for Auschwitz. ''It was sometimes as if we had never existed. For my generation, it was like a second death.'' **********As Salonika, Greece's second-largest city, celebrates its turn this year as the European Union's cultural capital, the city is at last coming to terms with its own history. Its first monument to the victims of the Holocaust is to be erected soon in a downtown square, and two new museums dedicated to Jewish life and culture over the last five centuries are due to open this spring. **********Doing right by this Balkan city's past was ''one of the most difficult tasks'' that Panos Theodoridis, a writer and architectural restorer, said he confronted when he became the fourth artistic director of the organization in charge of events for the cultural-capital role. **********''People here tend to forget that this city was multinational right from the beginning,'' he said. ''Now it is time to pay homage to all those who formed the city's character.'' **********Mr. Sefiha, who took a leave from his family's machine-building business to devote his energies to a Jewish community that now numbers a mere 1,150, considers the establishment of the museums and the monument a belated act of justice. **********''I think after we have the monument, more people will be interested to know the history of this town -- why it is necessary to have a monument at all,'' he said. **********To the discomfort of local Greek nationalists, it is a history that was largely Jewish during the 500 years of Ottoman Turkish occupation, with strong influences of Armenians and the Turks themselves. The first great wave of Sephardic Jews came here in the late 15th century, expelled from Spain and Portugal. **********In time, the community grew with the arrivals of Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe, until, by the late 19th century, Jews made up two-thirds of the population of this flourishing port city. **********Business was conducted either in French or Ladino, the Judeo-Hispanic language spoken by the Sephardim, and shops and offices closed on Saturday for the Jewish Sabbath. **********All evidence of this past is virtually gone now, and not only because of the Nazis. There were fires and earthquakes but also a local strain of Greek nationalism, fueled by the arrival in 1923 of about 160,000 ethnic Greeks transferred here from the Turkish mainland. **********Greece, a country where more than 95 percent of the population is Orthodox Christian, is still suspicious of its minorities, religious and ethnic, and still reluctant to grant them their place in history. Not only has Salonika never commemorated its Holocaust victims, but its children also find scant reference to the city's multicultural past in their school textbooks. **********''Nothing appears in the books -- no mention at all,'' said Mr. Sefiha. ''But I am sure one day people will write again the story of this town in a more objective way. '' **********The Jewish contribution to the city's past is not the only historical memory to have fallen victim here to a collective amnesia. In local guidebooks, and even in literature printed for this year's international cultural events, the five centuries of Ottoman rule are referred to euphemistically as the ''post-Byzantine'' period, a reflection of the strong anti-Turkish sentiment that is part of Greek consciousness. **********And yet, curiously enough, this was not always so. In the 1930's, in a gesture of good will to the modern secular Turkish state founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the local city council offered him as a gift the house where he had been born -- a modest, pleasant building with a garden, which has survived as one of the few examples of Turkish middle-class life in a city that was once the second largest in the Ottoman Empire. **********The house -- now attached to the heavily guarded Turkish Consulate -- is now not only forgotten, but deliberately ignored by local authorities, who never include it in any list of local historical attractions. **********Few Greeks are even aware that Ataturk was born in Salonika or that this was where the Young Turks began the revolution that eventually brought down the Ottoman Empire. The street along the side of the house, which was once called Ataturk Street, was long ago renamed. **********Place names are still a sensitive issue in this corner of the Balkans. Local sentiment is still strongly opposed to the idea that the name Macedonia -- the kingdom of Alexander the Great, the region's most illustrious native son -- be shared with the newly independent state next door, once one of the Yugoslav republics. Known as Macedonia to most of the rest of the world, here in northern Greece it is referred to elliptically as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom for short, the temporary name used officially by the United Nations and foreign governments), and its people are called Skopjians, after the country's capital, Skopje. **********Under international pressure, Greece finally lifted its economic embargo against independent Macedonia in September 1995, but the dispute over the name -- now being negotiated in New York under the auspices of a United Nations mediator, Cyrus Vance -- still looms large, blocking a complete normalization of relations. **********Greek traders bringing goods south from Macedonia into Greece still have to snip off the ''Made in Macedonia'' labels and replace them with the more mysterious ''Made in Fryom.'' Macedonian bank and customs documents have to be retyped, just as televisions made in Turkey are refitted for trade here with labels reading ''Made in China.'' **********Such torturing of history, and reality, makes for a heavy burden, one that many here hope will be shed as this city -- and the turbulent region that it borders -- moves closer to modern European standards. **********''It is impossible to live within the European Union without being really European,'' said Mr. Sefiha.

Those provisions include a ''poison pill'' that complicates hostile efforts to acquire more than 25 percent of True North stock; Publicis now owns 18.4 percent and seeks to reach 50.1 percent through its tender offer. **********In one portion of the request to amend the suit, Publicis also contended that True North ''used a private investigator'' between September 1995 and February 1996 to investigate Maurice Levy, chairman and chief executive of Publicis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/07/news/for-malaysia-can-one-national-card-do-it-all.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Fuller", "pub_date": "1997-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1445, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Malaysia, Can One 'National Card' Do It All?", "print_headline": "For Malaysia, Can One 'National Card' Do It All?", "body_text": " **********KUALA LUMPUR\u2014                     If the Malaysian government has its way, every person over 12 years old in this country of 20 million will soon have a piece of silicon in his pocket. **********Bidding is under way for a project that will produce the ultimate \"national card\" \u2014 a card with identification, driver's license, medical information and immigration status all crammed onto one computer chip. The card will also feature an electronic purse, replacing cash for small purchases. **********Similar plans for national cards exist in other countries \u2014 Singapore is working on a national card project, and South Korea is considering using chips in driver's licenses. **********But the people involved in Malaysia's one-citizen, one-chip project say it is the most ambitious plan by any country to combine government services on one card. **********Planners bill the project \u2014 part of the country's drive into the global multimedia industry \u2014 as a practical way to make government more efficient. The immigration portion of the chip will speed up border formalities, they say, and the health card will store medical information to improve diagnosis and emergency care. The electronic purse will eliminate the need for cash when buying things like a newspaper or a cup of coffee. **********The project, estimated to cost at least $800 million to launch, is being pushed by Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, who at age 71 has his own World Wide Web page (http://www.smpke.jpm.my/jaring/pm/pm.html). **********For years, officials in Malaysia \u2014 where citizens over age 12 already carry a paper national identity card \u2014 have been studying plans to streamline and harmonize government services, and now the effort seems embodied in the card project. The plan will, for example, require the police, doctors and newsstand vendors to have compatible chip-reading equipment, but each would have the ability to access only certain portions of the chip. The police will be able to store such data as traffic infractions on the card, and a newspaper vendor will be able to debit the card for the cost of a magazine. **********The project, if successful, would offer Malaysia the opportunity to export the system to other countries. \"It's just going to put Malaysia so far ahead of the other countries that they're going to broker that into an intellectual-services industry,\" said Bob Hepple a smart-card specialist at Visa International, one of the bidders in the project. **********But given the scope of the plan, and the country's current financial situation, the \"if\" in the project looms large. **********\"Politely, I would say it's going to be a challenge,\" said Alex Tan of Hypercom International, another company bidding for a role in the project. **********Tests are scheduled to begin next year, and residents of metropolitan Kuala Lumpur are due to be issued their cards before 2000. **********But already the card's planners have had to climb down from initial plans to include credit and debit card facilities in the first phase of the project, which would have created what one industry analyst called a \"Chase Manhattan driver's license.\" **********Kuala Lumpur now plans to follow what is euphemistically called a \"two-card approach.\" The government card would eventually be merged with a national payment card \u2014 a plan that skeptics say may never happen. **********Of more immediate concern to planners is the security of the card. Mr. Hepple of Visa offered this scenario: A person parks his car in the middle of Kuala Lumpur and pays the parking fee with the electronic purse function of his card. **********\"Are people going to be comfortable that their name and address are available to that parking meter?\" Mr. Hepple asked. \"Is that parking meter going to break the law, decide that, 'O.K., this guy is obviously rich because he has a car. And he's not at home, so we can go and burgle his house?\"' **********Chip designers and card manufacturers say there is always a technical answer to security concerns. \"Data are put in separate compartments and guarded by secret keys,\" said Raphael Auphan, general manager in Malaysia for Gemplus, a leading smart-card company based in France. \"Only certain devices can access the different compartments.\" **********But experts say they also wonder whether putting that much data on one piece of silicon is a good idea. **********\"This would never go over in Germany or the U.S. or the Scandinavian countries,\" said a Malaysian official involved in the project. \"In Malaysia, it's different. The minute we're born we already have a number. That's where the cultural differences come into play.\" **********Even with the Western countries seemingly out of the picture, the official said he was little concerned about room for growth outside of Malaysia, noting that expansion of the card system into the nine-member Association of South East Asian Nations, or ASEAN, might be the next step. **********\"We are thinking about whether we should have an ASEAN-wide standard so that the card that is issued in Malaysia or Singapore or Indonesia can be used region-wide,\" the official said. **********\"But we have to prove that it can work first in Malaysia.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/10/business/accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Kmart Corp., Troy, Mich., to Baldi, Bloom & Whelan Advertising Inc., New York, as the first agency to handle advertising for its two stores in Manhattan.

Plans by a nonprofit group, the Population Council, to produce it in the United States by late this year were unaffected by the announcement Tuesday. **********Hoechst acknowledged that the heat of the debate over RU-486 in the United States was an important factor in its decision.

Mr. Marenzi declined to comment on the practice of linking series to hit films. **********Mediaset's Mr. Stabilini and RTL's Mr. Thoma, however, said depriving broadcasters of hit films may set a dangerous precedent. **********\"This practice undermines the whole concept of the 'output deal,' which is structured on purpose specifically to obtain these locomotive feature films for TV,\" Mr. Thoma said. \"All the other stuff \u2014 the series, the sitcoms and so on \u2014 are not successful, in Germany at any rate. Everyone is rethinking the whole situation.\" **********Meanwhile, independent producers complain that they are being shut out of overseas markets by the major studios. **********\"When we go to some European stations, they say we've already got all these American programs that we had to take just to get 'Lost World,\"' said Todd Leavitt, chairman of the television group of Alliance Communications Corp., based in Toronto. \"We're being locked out.\" **********The industry is also seeing increasing conflict over producers holding back programs from broadcasters to supply their own channels. **********Children's programming, for instance, once destined for free television networks, is now being snapped up by pay networks such as Viacom's Nickelodeon, Time Warner's Cartoon Network and News Corp.'s Fox Kids, said Ronald Weinberg, president of Cinar Films Inc., a Canadian producer of children's films and television series."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/30/business/worldbusiness/IHT-rate-hikeanalysts-say-fed-will-stick-to-94127799248.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-06-30", "snippet": "Analysts predicted that Japanese bond prices would probably rise this week on expectations that industrial production will fall, keeping the Bank of Japan from raising interest rates, Bloomberg reported from Tokyo.

He was 72 and had long suffered from prostate cancer. **********In a political career that began under British colonial rule in the 1950's and ended only when declining health forced him to step down as Prime Minister in 1992, Mr. Manley championed issues ranging from Caribbean solidarity to the reordering of the global economy. **********He was born to wealth and privilege but made his mark as an advocate for the impoverished and underprivileged, in Jamaica and throughout the developing world. **********''Gross maldistribution of the world's wealth and food is no longer a moral offense only,'' Mr. Manley wrote in an article for The New York Times in 1975 that was a typical expression of his political views. ''It now represents the greatest practical threat to peace and to any desirable development of mankind.'' **********Prime Minister P. J. Patterson, Mr. Manley's protege, described his predecessor as a ''colossal figure,'' and Jamaicans began lining up before dawn yesterday outside the Prime Minister's official residence to offer their condolences. **********Michael Norman Manley was born in Kingston on Dec. 10, 1924, into one of the island's most notable families. His father, Norman Washington Manley, was an Oxford-trained lawyer and orator who was to lead Jamaica to independence as Prime Minister from 1955 to 1962. His English-born mother, Edna Swithenbank Manley, was a prominent sculptor. **********From birth, Mr. Manley was raised in an atmosphere that combined political and artistic ferment. Norman Manley founded the People's National Party, which would eventually serve as the vehicle to power for both father and son, in 1938, while Edna Manley became the focal point of a lively circle of artists, poets and musicians who made the Manley estate, Drumblair, their second home. **********Though Mr. Manley later said he considered himself ''the most privileged man in Jamaica'' because of that upbringing, he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force as an 18-year-old, in part to establish an identity independent of his glittering parents. He served a year and a half but did not see combat. **********Once World War II ended, he enrolled at the London School of Economics, where he was exposed to the democratic brand of socialism espoused by Harold Laski, who became his intellectual mentor. **********After his return to Jamaica in December 1951, Mr. Manley quickly became involved in the trade union movement, focusing his efforts on improving salaries and living conditions for the island's sugar and bauxite workers. In 1962, when Jamaica achieved independence from Britain, he was appointed to the Senate; five years later, he was elected to Parliament and became vice president of the party his father was still leading. **********In 1969, Norman Manley died, and Michael Manley succeeded him as president of the People's National Party. Tall, handsome, charismatic and a spellbinding orator who enthralled large crowds on the campaign trail, Mr. Manley won a landslide victory in the general election that followed in 1972, becoming Jamaica's fourth Prime Minister. **********Once in office, Mr. Manley set out to reduce what he called the ''irrational and dangerous'' economic inequalities and class divisions that defined Jamaican society. He expanded the health and education systems, organized job training programs for the young and the unemployed, fostered racial pride and tried to encourage agricultural self-sufficiency through state farms. **********That same year, Mr. Manley addressed the United Nations and chastised what he called ''the misplaced priorities'' of its members, ''especially the most powerful and wealthy ones.'' Along with Prime Minister Indira Ghandi of India and President Julius K. Nyerere of Tanzania, Mr. Manley became one of the most outspoken advocates of what he called a new international economic order for developing nations. **********''The point is that now some two-thirds of mankind have been reduced to a peripheral status in political, economic and even social terms,'' he wrote. The solution, he argued, was a redistribution of the world's wealth, with the poor countries that ''own the resources and provide the essential infrastructure and the labor force'' getting a larger share. To do that, he argued in one memorable phrase, capitalism should be demolished ''brick by brick.'' **********At home, he tried to put theory into practice by raising royalties on exports of bauxite, the ore from which aluminum is made, and acquiring a controlling share of American and Canadian bauxite companies. He was successful on both counts, but in doing so antagonized the Nixon and Ford Administrations. **********Mr. Manley also sought a much closer relationship with Cuba, which further strained his ties with the United States. He imported hundreds of Cuban doctors, teachers and construction workers and invited Fidel Castro, whom he described as ''a man of extraordinary political sophistication,'' to visit Jamaica. **********Later, Mr. Manley said that even though the United States ''overreacted'' to his friendship with Mr. Castro, he too bore part of the blame for the deterioration of Jamaica's relationship with Washington. ''We became defiant about it, and that was a mistake,'' he said in 1988. **********Though of mixed racial background, Mr. Manley also became one of most forceful boosters and benefactors of the Black Power movement that swept the Caribbean. **********''An epoch of brainwashing in white-oriented society has left scars which, however unconscious, mar the inner assurance with which black people accept their own forms of beauty and excellence,'' he proclaimed in 1969. **********In his 1972 election campaign, Mr. Manley often wore African garb and carried the ''Rod of Joshua,'' an ebony-and-ivory staff said to have been given to him by Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, as a symbol of moral authority and black pride. That helped win him the support of the Rastafarian movement and other black nationalists initially suspicious of his cosmopolitan, mulatto background. **********As Prime Minister, Mr. Manley encouraged and subsidized Afro-Caribbean forms of cultural expression like reggae music, which became a global phenomenon during his tenure, persisting even when the lyrics of some songs criticized his policies. ''If anybody is going to protest against me, at least I want them to do so with style,'' he once said, with characteristic good humor. **********After more than 100 people were killed in outbreaks of gang and political violence in 1976, Mr. Manley, attributing the clashes to right-wing opponents, imposed a state of emergency. He won another resounding victory at the polls that year, but his second term was marked by increasing polarization and a sharp economic decline, which forced him to seek loans from his ideological adversaries at the International Monetary Fund. **********In 1980 he was decisively defeated by a conservative, Edward P. G. Seaga of the Jamaica Labor Party, after a campaign in which an estimated 700 people were killed. His party boycotted the election called in 1983, complaining that promised electoral reforms had not been carried out, and it was not represented in Parliament for the next six years. Mr. Manley spent much of that time working on behalf of the Socialist International. **********But he was returned to power early in 1989, after promising not to repeat the errors of his first period in office. He patched up his ties with the private sector and with the United States, saying at a news conference just after he was elected that ''to allow ourselves to slide into an unnecessary state of tension'' with Washington was a blunder ''that can never happen again.'' **********''I kept thinking that you could make the world economy submit to a system of political management to safeguard against injustice and inequity,'' Mr. Manley said in another interview that year, analyzing his earlier outlook. ''I didn't realize the forces of production are too powerful, and their inherent logic too irresistible, to be made subservient to political barriers on a permanent basis.'' **********As a result of his change of heart, Mr. Manley largely pursued orthodox free-market economic policies during his second stint in office. He let the Jamaican dollar float, removed price controls and subsidies, sped up the privatization of state-owned enterprises and relaxed restrictions on foreign investment, all of which won him praise from the United States. **********''He has set a great example, and I admire his stance,'' President George Bush said. Nevertheless, Mr. Manley continued to assert that he was a socialist, arguing that ''socialism is about equality'' and vowing never to give up his commitment to economic and racial justice. **********In 1992 he announced that he would step down for health reasons. He had undergone five operations for prostate cancer, diverticulitis and pneumonia, in which part of his lung and colon had been removed. In retirement he spent most of his time growing coffee and flowers on his farm outside Kingston or following sports, especially cricket, which he deeply loved. **********Mr. Manley, who began his career as a journalist, first with the BBC and The Observer in London and later with newspapers in Kingston, was also the author of seven books and many essays and articles. His books ranged from a collection of his speeches and political volumes like ''Poverty of the Nations: Reflections on Underdevelopment and the World Economy'' to ''A History of West Indies Cricket.'' **********His body is to lie in state at the National Arena in Kingston next Friday and Saturday, the Government announced yesterday, and after a state funeral on March 16 will be buried at National Heroes' Park. **********Mr. Manley is survived by his fifth wife, Glynne Ewert, and five children: Rachel, Joseph, Sarah, Natasha and David."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/06/business/malaysian-concern-gets-bid-for-appliance-stake.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-05-06", "snippet": "Berjaya Group Bhd of Malaysia receives 'third party' offer to buy its stake in Berjaya Singer Bhd for 1.196 billion ringgit ($478.4 million) (S)", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Malaysian Concern Gets Bid for Appliance Stake", "print_headline": "Malaysian Concern Gets Bid for Appliance Stake", "body_text": " **********Berjaya Group Bhd. of Malaysia said yesterday that it had received a ''third party'' offer to buy its stake in Berjaya Singer Bhd. for 1.196 billion ringgit ($478.4 million).

Their sojourn, which ends today, served to reawaken public sympathy for their lagging cause and rekindle the rebels' determination to pursue their defense of Mexico's Indians from their strongholds in the state of Chiapas. **********But the Zapatistas' stay produced no progress toward reopening peace talks with the Government that lapsed a year ago. The Government allowed them to move about freely but offered no new negotiating proposals. The Zapatistas only created confusion over whether they want to continue as a guerrilla army, albeit a feeble one, or lay down arms. **********Zapatista leaders had said the purpose of their long march to the capital was to inaugurate a new civilian front to serve as a landing pad for rebels who want to put down their weapons. But on Saturday the rebels read a communique from Subcommander Marcos, their highest non-Indian leader and chief strategist, saying they would not join the new front, even though it bears the Zapatista name. **********''The Government uses the lie of a peace which means nothing more than surrender and punishment for us,'' Subcommander Marcos wrote. He accused the Government of failing to comply with partial peace accords signed in February 1996, and of stepping up army surveillance in their communities in Chiapas. **********More than 2,000 delegates from civilian support groups across Mexico went ahead and formed the political front, with the rebels from Chiapas standing by as ''observers.'' Leaders of the new organization were adamant that it would not be a political party but were hard pressed to explain exactly what it would do. **********The Government, which welcomed the Zapatistas' visit as a sign that they are moving toward peaceful means of protest, once again rejected their demands for greater autonomy for Indians as dangerously separatist. **********''The solution to the conflict in Chiapas cannot go against the unity and cohesion of Mexico,'' Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet warned. **********The only forward movement came from the Congress, where the opposition now controls the lower house. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, the leader of that chamber, said he plans to introduce a bill this week that would translate the 1996 accords into law. **********At least one important by-product of the visit was the education of the militants themselves. At first the Zapatistas set up tight security perimeters everywhere they went, using sympathizers standing shoulder to shoulder. They remained aloof from supporters and bullied the clamoring press. **********By Tuesday they had abandoned their fears and military discipline and put on an easygoing rap session and soccer match with students on the campus of the national university. **********A Chol Indian from a Chiapas jungle hamlet, who mixed happily with the students, said: ''I have been able to see with my own eyes that people support us.

As she waits to learn whether she is pregnant, the numbers on the watch face turn into ''yes'' and ''no.'' Then the ''hot'' and ''cold'' labels on her sink faucets, and even drops of water falling from the spigot, do the same. **********''When you're waiting to find out if you're pregnant or not, nothing else in the world matters until you know,'' an announcer says as the woman waits. As the spots close, we see the woman smile mischievously when she gets her answer, though we never learn whether she is expecting. **********''When we went to consumers in the storyboard stage, they told us the basic idea totally captured the way that women feel when they think they're pregnant,'' said Natasha Kavanagh, the management supervisor for the campaign at Ogilvy & Mather, part of the WPP Group. **********''This is a very different kind of advertising than is typically done for this category,'' she added, ''which tends to be rather uninteresting and predictable.'' **********The Clear Blue line of products, which also includes Clear Plan Easy, an ovulation test, is made by Unipath Diagnostics, an American subsidiary of Unilever that markets women's health products. The $7 million campaign for the one-minute test, which consists of three commercials -- one 30 seconds long and two 15 seconds long -- will run nationally starting on Monday. It has run in local markets, including Chicago; Little Rock, Ark., and Tampa, Fla., since June 12. **********Mr. Lynch, who declined to be interviewed for this article, apparently expressed interest in the campaign early, when the agency was showing the storyboards for the spots to several directors.

''We chose David not on the basis of his reputation, but on his interpretation of what the story- boards meant to him.'' **********In the last nine years, Mr. Lynch has directed commercials for 10 other campaigns, ranging from spots for Opium perfume by Yves Saint Laurent to public service announcements for the American Cancer Society to spots for Alka-Seltzer Plus. In addition to ''Blue Velvet,'' released in 1986, his film credits include his 1976 debut, ''Eraserhead,'' and ''The Elephant Man'' in 1980, ''Wild at Heart'' in 1990 and ''Lost Highway'' last year. The television show ''Twin Peaks'' achieved widespread popularity during its run on ABC in 1990 and 1991, and its look is considered to have influenced current series like ''The X-Files.'' **********David Cohen, executive producer of the commercials, said that Mr. Lynch was attracted to the campaign for reasons more mundane than one might expect from the creator of characters like Frank Booth, the sadistic, irrational man portrayed by Dennis Hopper in ''Blue Velvet.'' **********Mr. Lynch believed the spots ''had a solid concept,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''and they were nicely thought through in graphics and in terms of telling the story.'' **********Clear Blue Easy holds a 6 percent share of the $206 million market for home pregnancy tests in the United States. The leading test, with 23 percent, is E.P.T., made by the Warner-Lambert Company. Commercials for E.P.T., by J. Walter Thompson New York, another unit of WPP, show women talking about getting wrong results with home pregnancy tests and assert that E.P.T. is highly accurate and easy to use. **********''The ads feature women sharing their real-life experiences,'' said Jeffrey Baum, a spokesman for Warner-Lambert in Morris Plains, N.J., ''and we found that consumers can relate.'' **********With the commercials by Mr. Lynch, Unipath says it wants to add more depth to its campaign. **********The idea ''required an understanding of female psychology and the nervous excitement that someone feels when they think they're pregnant,'' Mr. Paton said.

The suspended sentence gave him his liberty in a glare of free publicity just days before the June 1 publication of his memoirs in 14 countries including the United States. **********In the weeks before the verdict today, pre-publication serialization of the memoirs has infuriated many politicians here by accusing the late Herbert Wehner -- a towering Social Democrat in West German politics -- of maintaining conspiratorial links to the erstwhile East German authorities. **********But, from a cinematic viewpoint, the memoirs' most striking picture is of two C.I.A. operatives arriving at his country home outside Berlin in 1990 -- a few months after the fall of the Berlin wall -- laden with pralines and flowers and offering him a new identity in California and a large amount of money in return for the names of his agents. **********Today's verdict followed six years of efforts by German federal prosecutors to punish Mr. Wolf for his role as head of East Germany's foreign intelligence department -- a position that once earned him the sobriquet of ''the man without a face'' among Western intelligence operatives who, for years, did not know what he looked like. **********In 1993 -- two years after he gave himself up to the German authorities -- the same Dusseldorf court convicted Mr. Wolf on treason charges and ordered him jailed for six years. But the verdict was overturned in 1995 after Germany's highest court ruled that former East German intelligence officials could not be accused as traitors for espionage activities in their own country. **********Last January prosecutors invoked East German law to charge Mr. Wolf with kidnapping, coercion and causing bodily harm -- offenses subject to a statute of limitations for former West German spies but not for their East German counterparts. **********The case has provoked debate between easterners and westerners over the same issue that troubles other countries, from South Africa today to Germany a half-century ago: How should figures from the past be dealt with when repressive regimes give way to democratic successors? **********Mr. Wolf and his supporters -- some of whom crammed the Dusseldorf courtroom today to greet him with applause and roses -- maintain that he has been tried as an emblem of a defeated regime by vengeful people who still cannot come to terms with his ability to hoodwink them. **********But the presiding judge in Dusseldorf, Ina Obst-Ollers, argued today, ''I want to set it straight that he was not convicted because he was a Stasi symbol.'' Stasi is the shortening of the German state security apparatus in which Mr. Wolf worked. ''He was accused of concrete crimes.'' **********Those crimes included the abduction of a Stasi defector from Austria in 1962, the 1955 kidnapping of a German translator working for the United States authorities in West Berlin and the 1959 detention of an East German typesetter who had worked for the Gestapo in occupied Norway during World War II. **********The prosecution, which dropped separate treason charges three weeks ago to speed up the hearings, had demanded a jail term of three and a half years, and defense lawyers depicted the two-year suspended sentence as a victory. **********''I should be able to live with this judgment if I did not believe it was a violation of the law and the Constitution,'' Mr. Wolf said. He betrayed no emotion as the verdict was read. Both defense and prosecution now have one week to consider appeals. **********Mr. Wolf was head of East Germany's foreign intelligence agency from 1953 to 1986, running a network of some 4,000 agents. Possibly the most illustrious of those was Gunter Guillaume, infiltrated into the personal office of former Chancellor Willy Brandt. The unmasking of Mr. Guillaume in 1974 brought down Mr. Brandt's Government. **********In his memoirs, however, Mr. Wolf chronicles what United States and other Western intelligence services long suspected about West Germany in the cold war, namely that many of its officials maintained clandestine contacts with the Communist East and passed on classified information about United States and NATO intentions. The memoirs are being published in Germany as ''Spy Chief in the Secret War,'' by List Verlag, a unit of Axel Springer Verlag, and in the United States as ''Man Without a Face,'' by Times Books/Random House, a unit of Advance Publications. **********So keen was American intelligence to find out the extent of his knowledge, Mr. Wolf says in the memoirs, that, in May 1990, Gardner Hathaway, the just-retired assistant C.I.A. director for counterintelligence, and another agent appeared at his door with an offer from the then-C.I.A. chief, William Webster. **********Seeking to lure the East German with a ''seven-figure sum'' and a home in California, Mr. Hathaway reportedly told Mr. Wolf, ''California is very beautiful, great weather.'' **********''Siberia isn't bad, either,'' Mr. Wolf said he replied."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/15/business/fannie-mae-profit-meets-analysts-estimates.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-01-15", "snippet": "Federal National Mortgage Association reports fourth-quarter 1996 net of $712.1 million, compared with $406.3 million in year-earlier period (S)", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fannie Mae Profit Meets Analysts' Estimates", "print_headline": "Fannie Mae Profit Meets Analysts' Estimates", "body_text": " **********The Federal National Mortgage Association met analysts' expectations for the fourth quarter with a sharp jump in earnings. **********And the company provided a clear sign that it has learned to manage earnings growth in diverse interest environments, analysts said yesterday, with a 15 percent year-over-year increase in earnings for 1996 -- a year that saw mortgage rates climb more than 100 basis points and then fall another 70 basis points. **********Fannie Mae is a Government-sponsored enterprise created to buy loans from primary lenders to return funds to the mortgage market. **********Fannie Mae reported fourth-quarter earnings of $712.1 million, or 65 cents a share.

She moved with her family to the outskirts of this dusty capital, among the hundreds of thousands of internal migrants who have deserted the infertile rural regions of Europe's poorest country for the lure of the city. **********She said she prefers her tedious low-paying factory job to being married off by her parents to a man they would choose and whom she would be obliged to serve for the rest of her life. **********In male-dominated Albania, a dowry is not a sign of wealth but rather a sign of servitude. Until recently, the bride's parents put a bullet inside the dowry box to show that if their daughter was not dutiful, the husband could shoot her. Bullets are no longer de rigueur, but the attitude prevails. **********This has created a clash between  traditional culture, which is gradually fading, and an aspiration for a modern way of life. **********''In my rural society, it is unimaginable to send daughters to work,'' Miss Cara said. ''They are all trying to get their daughters married,'' she added, relaxing after eight hours on a tiring assembly line. ''There, society has its rules and if you step over them, you are an outsider.'' **********Tirana was once off-limits to peasants, who were forbidden by the rigid Communist system to move from their villages. But the city's population has more than doubled -- to about 500,000 -- in the last five years. That has created deep social and cultural upheavals along with Albania's violent political turmoil. **********Ever-widening encampments of squatters have circled the city, where the horse-drawn buggies of the countryside compete with the shiny new Mercedes-Benz cars of young drug runners. Everyone has been drawn by the economic free-for-all, which includes legitimate industries as well as drug smuggling. People like Miss Cara move to the city for jobs that pay $35 a month in light industries that make cheap goods for export to Italy. Albania's average wage is about $60, by far the skimpiest in Europe, but even with a small salary by Albanian standards, Miss Cara considers herself lucky to have a real job. **********Her father, Han, a 55-year-old former copper miner who began working at age 13, sold the family apartment in Kukes, a historic Muslim town, and packed the family onto a bus for the nine-hour journey over winding roads to the capital. **********''It was cold, there was no work and when you see everyone leaving, you leave too,'' said Mr. Cara, who lost his job in the mines and whose wife, Naile, had been laid off as a hotel cook. **********They brought with them a 20-year-old wood-burning stove, a few pieces of furniture, a little cash from the sale of their apartment and five nearly adult children. Since arriving in the flatland around Tirana, the Cara family has gone through profound change. **********They settled in a makeshift hut on  land, which, like other squatters, they did not buy. They then built their three-room house, sifting the sand for the cement and laying the cinder blocks. With their new neighbors, they banded together to protest a lack of running water and electricity. **********During their protests, the community fought the police, then kidnapped a prominent politician, a move that led to a settlement. They were granted electricity, but they get  water only sporadically. **********The eldest daughter, Ferite, 24, fled to the Italian city of Turin, a center for Albanian prostitutes, and returned recently sporting peroxided permed hair, a micro-mini skirt, platform shoes, heavy makeup and an armload of costume jewelry. Her outfit contrasted sharply with her mother's mountain attire -- dark, wide-legged pantaloons covered by a long skirt, blouse and a head scarf, signifying her Muslim religion. **********Miranda Cara said that on visits home, Ferite, flush with money, has been dismissive of the factory job of which Miranda is so proud. **********But Miss Cara said the most profound aspect of her work had been the independence to hold down her own job. She joins together plastic pieces of tiny toys that are exported to Italy to be packaged with chocolate bonbons and then exported to the world. **********''In order to get the $35 a month you have to meet a target of handling a lot of toys a day,'' she said. ''It is boring. There are no women at the plant over the age of 40. You have to be speedy but I have nimble fingers and I can do it.'' **********Because of their poverty, the Cara family did not invest in the pyramid schemes that defaulted earlier this year and left much of the Albanian population without their savings. But they have been hurt by the economic collapse that followed. Prices have soared, and Miss Cara's salary is not worth what it used to be. She can pay  for her bus fare to work and for her contribution to the family for food but no extras. Plans for extensions to the house have been jettisoned. **********One of her brothers recently married a cousin from a mountain region  -- a union arranged by both sets of parents. Spent cartridge shells were strewn outside the house, remnants of a celebratory shooting spree that accompanies many Albanian weddings. **********An early marriage is still expected of her, but Miss Cara is looking beyond that and beyond the assembly line. Armed with her high school diploma, she now dreams of going to the university and of becoming a historian. **********''The mountains are beautiful,'' she said. ''The snow is so pure that you can bring it inside in a tub, put it on a fire and wash your clothes in it.

Opposition leaders were splintered along ethnic  lines, unable to find a single candidate to challenge the man who has ruled Kenya for 19 years. With his political enemies divided, it looked as if the President would win re-election easily. **********But now it appears that calls for revamping the Constitution to give the President less power have caught fire with the beleaguered Kenyan middle class, who are weary of the East African nation's steadily declining economy and the rampant corruption in the administration. **********What remains unclear is whether the opposition can harness that anti-Government sentiment and rally behind a candidate capable of winning the election, diplomats said. **********''We are seeing a groundswell of frustration and anger against the current Government,'' a diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''But I haven't seen the opposition offer an alternative yet.'' **********A confluence of political interests have fueled the current tide of popular opinion against Mr. Moi, diplomats say. Several influential church leaders have joined with human rights advocates and charity directors in calling not only for a new Constitution but also for the repeal of colonial-era laws giving the Government sweeping powers to detain people, break up demonstrations and harass opposition groups. **********Opposition politicians who have joined the reform movement have long complained that the electoral rules under the current Constitution give them almost no chance of winning an election against Mr. Moi. **********The Constitution requires a president to garner at least a quarter of the vote in five of Kenya's eight districts. This dilutes the power of the two largest tribes -- the Luo and the Kikuyu -- who are concentrated in two heavily populated districts.  The election rules also do not require a president to get a majority of the votes cast, which means a member of a minority tribe like Mr. Moi can win as long as he hammers together a plurality of smaller groups. **********The reformers have been pushing for an amendment requiring a winning candidate to get at least half of all the votes cast, which would help candidates from the larger tribes. **********The opposition has also said the Constitution should allow coalition governments. Kenya has a winner-take-all system, giving Mr. Moi all the Cabinet seats and power even though his party can at best garner only about 40 percent of the vote. A change would open the door for other opposition leaders who cannot get a majority to still form a government with other opposition parties. **********On May 31, Mr. Moi showed he was willing to take a hard line against the reformers. Riot police crushed a protest by about 1,000 people with tear gas and rubber bullets, setting off two days of looting and unrest. **********On June 1, the President promised to consider repealing the Public Order Act, which allows troops to use force to break up unlicensed protests. But even as he made the announcement, his soldiers kept several opposition leaders, who had promised a second protest, under house arrest in the capital. **********''It's going to be a very rough summer,'' one diplomat said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/12/world/china-asserts-taiwan-s-ties-to-guatemala-led-to-veto.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "1997-01-12", "snippet": "China says it vetoed United Nations resolution to send peacekeepers to Guatamela because of Guatemala's longstanding diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, which China regards as renegade province; has signaled that it might reconsider veto if Guatemal...", "word_count": 741, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Asserts Taiwan's Ties To Guatemala Led to Veto", "print_headline": "China Asserts Taiwan's Ties To Guatemala Led to Veto", "body_text": " **********China said today that its decision to veto a United Nations resolution that would have sent peacekeepers to Guatemala was justified by Guatemala's longstanding diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, an affront to Chinese sovereignty over the island it regards as a renegade province. **********''Guatemala cannot expect on the one hand to do something that harms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China while on the other hand requesting China to cooperate in peacekeeping,'' said Shen Guofang, the Chinese Government spokesman. His remarks were carried by the New China News Agency. **********''We had no choice,'' Mr. Shen said of the veto cast Friday night in the Security Council, noting that China had no objection to the principle of sending United Nations monitors to help carry out the peace accord that is ending 36 years of civil war in Guatemala. He said Guatemala was responsible for China's decision to use its authority as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council to scuttle a resolution supported by a majority of the 15-member Council. **********Diplomats in New York indicated that China had signaled that it might be willing to reconsider its veto in exchange for Guatemala's downgrading its relations with Taiwan and ceasing its support for Taiwan's re-entry into the United Nations. **********Guatemala and more than two dozen other countries, mostly in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa, extend formal diplomatic recognition to Taiwan as the Republic of China, the political descendant of Chiang Kai-shek's government that fled the mainland in 1949 after defeat by Mao Zedong's Communists. **********China's veto marked the first time in 24 years that Beijing had used its no vote in a matter outside the selection of the Secretary General and thus reflects a hardening of political attitudes in the Communist Party leadership here to confront Taiwan in a year when Hong Kong will return to Chinese rule after 150 years as a British colony. **********The return of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan to Chinese sovereignty has been a longstanding objective of China's Communist rulers. **********Beijing considers any recognition of Taiwan to be a boost to pro-independence forces there that have supported President Lee Teng-hui's drive to raise Taiwan's international standing as a sovereign political entity. President Lee says he opposes Taiwan independence and he pays lip service to his party's goal of reunification with the mainland, but as the first native-born Taiwanese President, Mr. Lee has also pursued a path of a strong, independent image. **********In Taiwan, Foreign Minister John Chang sharply rebuked Beijing's veto. ''It is extremely insensible and unreasonable for Communist China to mingle relations across'' the Taiwan Strait with a ''regional peacekeeping mission'' of the United Nations,'' he said. Mr. Chang attended the ceremony in which the peace accords were signed on Dec. 29. **********Taiwan lost its seat in the United Nations in 1971 and, under President Lee, has campaigned to re-enter it and has often called on Guatemala's support to do so. China's veto was cast as Taiwan's Prime Minister, Lien Chan, was visiting Nicaragua, another of the dwindling roster of Taiwan's diplomatic allies. In a blow last month, South Africa said it would be switching its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. **********The Vatican also remains in Taiwan's camp, and the Taiwanese Prime Minister was scheduled to make a swing through Europe to visit Pope John Paul II before heading to Africa to shore up Taiwan's support after the defection of South Africa. A sign of Beijing's determination to counter every Taiwan move aggressively was the announcement that the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, left on  Friday for an 11-day tour of European and African capitals. **********Under the terms of the Guatemala peace accord, the Guatemalan Army would pull back its combat units to prearranged locations while the rebel forces of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit were to assemble at eight separate locations to disarm.

Now American officials are questioning whether Mr. Jiang, who is assembling a leadership team that will be formally endorsed at a major party congress just before his visit here, is ready to take the politically difficult steps required for his country to join the club of trading nations. Now, 131 countries and regions are members of the World Trade Organization -- with the notable exceptions of g China and Russia -- and Beijing has sharply criticized the West for setting conditions that it believes bar it from entry. **********American officials say that China is unwilling to make large-scale concessions that would allow, for example, foreign companies to sell stock, deliver packages commercially and sell telecommunications services across the breadth of China. Currently, a number of companies are permitted to do these things, but only on an experimental basis in some cities. **********''China's offers were tepid,'' said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative who has supervised the delicate negotiations. ''This was a view shared by a number of our trading partners,'' she said, even Japan and Europe, which have pressed for quicker admission for China under relaxed rules. ''If China wishes its hopes to enter the W.T.O. to be a key element of the meeting with President Clinton, it must move quite rapidly now,'' she said. ''But there is no indication at this juncture that China intends to move meaningfully forward.'' **********Some of the comments made by Ms. Barshefsky's negotiating team and their Chinese counterparts in recent days were clearly part of the posturing that accompanies the complex economic negotiations that have become the 1990's successors to arms control talks. But the negotiations over market openings in China are particularly fraught with high-level politics in both capitals. **********Chinese leaders have to weigh whether it is worth surrendering further control over the nation's economy to market forces in order to meet the entrance requirements for the World Trade Organization. And they have to consider the potential political costs if open competition -- and a phasing out of subsidies to state-run industries -- results in waves of unemployment. **********In Washington, the current investigations into China's possible role in the 1996 Presidential and congressional campaigns have also lurked in the background. Several months ago, Chinese officials warned that they would not make a comprehensive trade offer if they believed that President Clinton could not enter serious negotiations that would also require concessions on the American side. **********''They are worried that any American concession to China would result in someone charging that the Chinese were getting a favor for their contributions, even if they didn't make any contributions,'' one senior American official said recently. ''And they may be right -- this is not a time when Clinton can make many horse trades.'' **********China's intentions may also become clearer in a series of high-level visits by American officials to Beijing over the next several months. Administration officials say President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, is considering a trip there later this month, if the latest Middle East crisis recedes. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin is planning his first trip there in late September, and that may turn out to be the last chance to settle on agreements that could be finalized during Mr. Jiang's state visit, the first by a top Chinese leader since the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square. **********But Ms. Barshefsky said she had no immediate plans to travel to China, despite an announcement by China's chief negotiator, Long Yongtu, that she was coming to Beijing soon. Her direct participation in the talks would be the surest sign that a deal was nearing. **********Negotiators who have sat at the table with the Chinese for several weeks report that there has been modest progress. For example, the Chinese promised not to provide export subsidies for agricultural products. Although China offers no such subsidies now, American officials are concerned that as China's market opens, farmers will press the Government to help them send their products abroad. **********China also agreed to eliminate import quotas for cars and minibuses -- which have kept American and Japanese makers from making vehicles in their existing factories and shipping them to China -- over 8 years instead of the 15 years they first offered. Currently, American auto manufacturers seeking to sell cars in China must enter joint ventures to build cars there, and agree to transfer significant manufacturing technology to their Chinese partners. While several carmakers have entered such arrangements, others have balked, saying China's demands are too high. **********Chinese negotiators have also agreed to abolish quotas on the importation of other items as soon as the country is admitted to the World Trade Organization, and reduce tariffs on a range of goods, although American officials say the cuts are still insufficient. **********At a meeting last month, President Clinton's economic advisers generally agreed that the most that could now be hoped for from Mr. Clinton's summit meeting with Mr. Jiang is a commitment to keep talking -- rather than a real accord."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/10/business/company-news-50-stake-in-american-ref-fuel-goes-for-237-million.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-12-10", "snippet": "Duke Energy Corp and United American Energy Corp pay $237 million in cash to acquire 50 percent stake in American Ref-Fuel from Air Products Chemicals Inc (S)", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "50% STAKE IN AMERICAN REF-FUEL GOES FOR $237 MILLION", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; 50% STAKE IN AMERICAN REF-FUEL GOES FOR $237 MILLION", "body_text": " **********The Duke Energy Corporation and the United American Energy Corporation paid $237 million in cash to acquire a stake in a waste-to-energy company from Air Products and Chemicals Inc. of Allentown, Pa.

Wolf, Republican of Virginia, of deliberately trying to stir up trouble and lie about true conditions in Tibet. **********''All people with a sense of justice, including the Tibetan people, are enraged by his actions,'' said the official, Raidi, who heads the local legislature in Tibet and uses one name. **********Mr. Wolf, who traveled to Tibet from Aug. 9 to 13 as a tourist without telling the authorities he was a Congressman, told reporters in Washington last week that he saw evidence of religious persecution and the obliteration of Tibetan culture and language by an influx of Chinese traders and merchants. **********In response to those assertions, Mr. Raidi listed a series of statistics to show that Tibet's economy, agricultural output and foreign trade were all growing fast, and he insisted that 46,000 monks and nuns can worship freely. **********But he defended the Government's tight control of unauthorized religious activities, which Chinese leaders often suspect of advocating independence for Tibet. **********''The reason to crack down on activities by separatists who are acting under cover of religion is to protect the majority of the religious believers and insure that the religious activities are carried out in line with the doctrines,'' Mr. Raidi said. **********''In line with the doctrines,'' as Mr. Raidi did not have to elaborate, means religious worship that submits to the authority of Communist Party officials, who generally ban any organized activity they themselves do not control. **********Today's outburst came as Washington and Beijing prepare for a summit meeting in late October, when President Jiang Zemin travels to the United States to meet President Clinton, and each side is eager to bridge disagreements over human rights and nuclear nonproliferation. **********However, concern over conditions in Tibet has been growing in Congress. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright recently agreed to name a special coordinator within the State Department to monitor conditions there and to urge China to negotiate with the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for peacefully campaigning for greater autonomy in his homeland. **********Mr. Raidi, reflecting Beijing's frustration at being unable to limit the moral authority of the Dalai Lama, denounced the religious leader as a tool of imperialist forces trying to undermine China. **********''He never concerned himself with the real life of the Tibetan people, and did nothing beneficial for Tibet,'' Mr. Raidi was quoted as saying. ''The Tibetan people, thus far, are aware of his separatist theory and have long abandoned him.'' **********Over the weekend, the New China News Agency also issued a series of statements quoting scholars who defended China's right to rule Tibet. **********One argued that Tibetan culture can coexist alongside Chinese culture just as Eskimo culture can in Alaska, which like Tibet is a spacious and remote area where the culture of a minority population lives under a higher sovereign. **********Mr. Wolf, a champion of religious freedom, said he had urged the Clinton Administration to press Mr. Jiang for the release of what human rights organizations estimate to be 700 prisoners of conscience in Tibet. He also argued that urgent action was needed to save Tibetan culture from being overwhelmed by Chinese settlers, who he said outnumbered ethnic Tibetans in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, by about 160,000 to 100,000. **********Mr. Raidi, in response, argued that Chinese residents account for less than 3 percent of the official population in all of Tibet. He did not offer statistics for Lhasa, and it is possible that many Chinese businessmen are counted as temporary residents and do not appear in official tallies, the same as thousands of military personnel stationed there. **********In his defense of Chinese rule, Mr. Raidi argued that Tibet had carried out democratic reforms beginning in 1959, the year the Dalai Lama escaped to exile in India after an uprising that might have led to his arrest. **********Yet in the 1960's and 1970's, even official Chinese accounts concede, zealous Chinese officials and rogue factions of Red Guards destroyed thousands of temples, banned virtually all religious worship and imprisoned untold thousands of monks and nuns. **********At the time, the Government insisted that Tibet was a happy place of progress, much as Mr. Raidi's statement today did. Today's statement was also notable for its strong nationalist tone. **********''Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Tibet experienced the most profound changes in its history during the last 40 years, particularly after the democratic reform,'' Mr. Raidi was quoted as saying."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/business/at-the-gate-i-scream-you-scream-will-wall-st-scream.html": {"writer_name": "Sana Siwolop", "pub_date": "1997-09-28", "snippet": "Outlook for investing in Friendly Ice Cream Corp's planned offering of 67 percent of company stock discussed; offering is part of Friendly's three-pronged effort to refinance its large debt; table; photo (M)", "word_count": 1123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I Scream.

Will Wall St. Scream?", "body_text": " **********FOR ice cream lovers in the Northeast, Friendly's restaurants have long been synonymous with tasty treats, from the company's signature shakes to its sundaes studded with bits of candy bars. **********But are investors willing to treat themselves to shares of the company's stock? **********Sometime next month, Friendly's parent, the Friendly Ice Cream Corporation of Wilbraham, Mass., wants to sell five million shares -- or 67 percent of its company -- for $19 to $21 apiece. **********Prospective investors may find the company's history attractive. Founded in 1935, Friendly's has long been an industry leader, offering innovations like, in 1951, half-gallons of ice cream that consumers could take home. Today, Friendly's is continuing efforts to fashion itself into a full-service family restaurant chain and to capitalize on its special allure for the sweet-toothed. **********But in recent years Friendly's has found  itself in a sticky mess. One reason is its debt. **********Due in large part to a leveraged buyout in 1988 by the Restaurant Company, an investor group, Friendly's carries a very heavy burden of long-term debt -- $386 million as of June. In 1996 alone, the debt cost the company $44.1 million in interest expense, contributing to a $7.8 million loss that represented the fifth consecutive year in which Friendly's had negative earnings. **********Indeed, the impending public offering is part of a three-pronged effort by Friendly's to refinance its large debt. The company hopes to raise $100 million, with more money coming from a new, $140 million credit facility, which includes a term loan and a letter of credit. And if the stock offering is successful, Friendly's plans to sell $200 million in 10-year notes. All told, it intends to use up to $362 million of the money it raises to straighten out its balance sheet. **********Industry analysts applaud the refinancing effort. But they still wonder whether the company can outrun growing competition from a host of other, expanding restaurant chains. **********True, Friendly's is still the leading full-service restaurant operator in the Northeast, where about 80 percent of its nearly 700 restaurants and franchises are located.  And so far, the company has only one big, established competitor there, Brigham's Inc. But on the way is Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc., whose specialty is running restaurant-gift shops on interstate highways mostly in the South. Its entrance into  New England is a worrisome sign for Friendly's, given that Cracker Barrel is growing at a rate of 20 percent a year. **********Also invading Friendly's stronghold are other family dining chains like Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden and Ruby Tuesday. Analysts say many of those chains can expand rapidly because they have little debt. **********To be sure, Friendly's, which declined to comment because it is not allowed to discuss its financial status in the period leading up to the offering, has been moving in the right direction. By sprucing up its restaurants, closing unproductive ones and offering higher-priced dishes like a steak entree, the company has raised its average revenue per restaurant by a healthy 29 percent during the last 10 years. But that rate lags behind the gains of nearly every other large restaurant chain. **********Its revenues from sales to supermarkets and institutions, which totaled just $1.4 million in 1989, have also improved. Because Friendly's has been pushing its treats in those precincts -- more than 5,000 supermarkets now carry its frozen desserts -- nonrestaurant revenues have jumped to $57.7 million for the 12 months ended in June, or nearly 10 percent of its total revenues of $665 million. **********Industry analysts are not surprised by these gains. **********''This company has an extremely powerful signature -- its ice cream,'' said Malcom  M. Knapp, a restaurant consultant in Manhattan. ''They look at their treat business as their special edge.'' **********To exploit that strength, Friendly's has stepped up efforts to link sales of its frozen treats with sales of its lunch and dinner entrees. The company has also been opening ice cream stores overseas -- in Britain and South Korea, for example -- as well as selling its treats in new domestic settings like stadiums and amusement parks. **********Because of the company's strong brand name, David Menlow, president of IPO Financial Network in Springfield, N.J., said Friendly's stock was likely to be well-received, opening at $1 to $2 over its offering price. ''Name-brand companies are garnering the most attention in this I.P.O. market,'' he explained. **********But like other analysts, Mr. Menlow questioned whether Friendly's stock would be able to sustain a premium over the long haul. **********In general, restaurant stocks have had a tough time over the last few years because of concerns over escalating competition in the industry. David Trossman, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown, said the 35 restaurant stocks in his company's index had gained an average of 7.1 percent since the beginning of the year. During the same time, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has appreciated more than 28 percent. **********Given the intense rivalries, Mr. Trossman said, ''the Street likes one of two things -- either a new restaurant concept that has very rapid growth potential, or some reason to believe that returns on a given base of restaurants will go up dramatically.'' **********Friendly's has yet to prove itself on either score. It is staying on top of food trends, like the wrap sandwich, but that effort hardly qualifies as a new concept. And its 1996 revenues grew in large part because of the introduction of higher-priced foods. Strong competition within the industry, however, limits how much farther Friendly's can push up prices. **********Friendly's seems to be having trouble carving out new territory, too. True, in July it entered into an agreement with Davco Restaurants -- the largest franchisee for Wendy's International -- under which Davco has bought rights to 34 existing Friendly's sites and has agreed to open 100 more during the next 10 years in the mid-Atlantic region. **********But no one knows how that long-term deal will work out. And, according to Mr. Knapp, efforts by Friendly's to expand into the Midwest have run into competition from companies like Denny's, Shoney's and Bob Evans Farms, which are established there. **********And while the company's newer restaurants are generating more than $1 million in revenue annually, the average revenue for all of its locations was $855,000 for the 12 months ended in June. The average Denny's or Shoney's restaurant now generates $1.2 million to $1.7 million a year, and often more, while the average Cracker Barrel brings in about $4 million, according to industry figures. **********And then there's that high dose of debt that Friendly's investors will be asked to swallow. In a recent report, Mark S. Basham, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, argued that the debt creates such large financial risks that the offering price should be lowered. And by a large sum: from its current $20 a share to $15, or less."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/23/world/6-officers-in-serb-police-back-on-job-in-bosnia.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1997-08-23", "snippet": "Six senior Bosnia Serb police commanders defy hard-line leadership in Pale to report for work at central police headquarters in Banja Luka for the first time since British troops seized the six police facilities in the city and ousted officers loy...", "word_count": 926, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "6 Officers In Serb Police Back on Job In Bosnia", "print_headline": "6 Officers In Serb Police Back on Job In Bosnia", "body_text": " **********Six senior Bosnian Serb police commanders walked into the central police headquarters to work today for the first time since British troops seized the six police facilities in this city and ousted officers loyal to the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic. **********''We are nervous,'' said the new chief, who asked to remain unidentified. ''Things are tense. This is not an easy situation for us.'' **********The officers, who defied the hard-line leadership in Pale by appearing for work today, spent the morning with American police officials from the United Nations International Police Task Force to begin what the officials term the ''restructuring'' of the city's 600-strong police force, although other people say the word ''purge,'' however, would probably be more accurate. **********All police supporters of Dr. Karadzic, an indicted war-crimes suspect who wields most of the power in the Serbian-governed portion of Bosnia although he holds no official office, will be dismissed, they said. And only officers loyal to his successor and rival, the Bosnian Serb President, Biljana Plavsic, will be reinstated. **********The seizure of the police stations, carried out on Tuesday by some 350 British troops who are with the 31,000-member peacekeeping force led by NATO, has effectively turned Banja Luka into a separatist enclave dominated by an administration that supports Ms. Plavsic. It has deeply  angered the leadership in Pale, the stronghold of Dr. Karadzic and his hard-line supporters. **********The Bosnian Serb representative of the country's three-member Presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, a close ally of Dr. Karadzic, said that all police who returned to work would be in defiance of the legal authority.  And he issued a dark threat, saying that after today he could not be responsible for any ''incidents'' that might occur. **********A group of police officers loyal to the leadership in Pale tried briefly to occupy a small police station outside Banja Luka on Thursday, but were turned back by the police inside. And heavily armed British troops wearing flak jackets and backed by armored vehicles have surrounded the city's police centers and carefully check all visitors. Many NATO officials say they fear Dr. Karadzic and his supporters may resort to violence in an effort to intimidate Ms. Plavsic's supporters. **********''We have about 400 of the city's police who have signed a list saying they are willing to return to work,'' said Henry E. Williams, a police officer from Citrus County, Florida, who heads the United Nations police monitoring force in the Bosnian Serb sector. ''Now we are just waiting to see if they will really return. This is all pretty intense. There is still an air of uncertainly. Our goal, in the end, is to integrate the police forces in all of Bosnia, but we have to crawl before we can walk.'' **********The return of the police today, who were part of a force of about 50,000 officers paid by Dr. Karadzic and directly under his control, signals a willingness by at least a small number of Bosnian Serb police officers to defy Dr. Karadzic and begin to conform to the detailed dictates of the Dayton peace accord. The accord includes an eventual integration of the police forces in the Muslim and Croat areas in the rest of Bosnia. **********''Today is the first day a few of us make a move to end our isolation from the rest of the world,'' said a senior police commander, who asked to remain unidentified. ''It is the first attempt to build a real democratic system. And it means that in Banja Luka we have accepted that those Muslims and Croats who were expelled from the city have the right to return. If all this works, it will be momentous.'' **********Roy Benifield, a retired police officer from Buford, Georgia, ran through the restructuring process with the six returning police inspectors as they downed cups of thick Turkish coffee and chain-smoked  American cigarettes. **********''All new police officers will go through courses on codes of conduct, respect for human rights and basic police procedures,'' he said. ''There will be a written exam and a psychological test. Before anyone is certified to work we will do background checks and every candidate will have his name be published in the paper so we can investigate any complaints about any officer.'' He also said that the officers will have to be cleared by the international war-crimes tribunal in The Hague. **********The abrupt arrival of the United Nations police monitors and the swift transition of authority seemed to stun many of the Serbian police commanders in the room. The Bosnian Serb police, who have been accused by United Nations officials of repeated human-rights violations and involvement in the smuggling of cigarettes and gasoline, have often been seen as hindering a return to the rule of law, often in cooperation with their wartime enemies. **********''The police in the Serb enclave work closely with the Croat and Muslim mafias,'' said a senior Western diplomat. ''Cars are stolen in the Muslim part of Bosnia and delivered to Serb police officials on the partition lines for sale. Because there is no cooperation between the Serb police and their Muslim and Croat counterparts there is never any investigation into what happened.'' **********The six inspectors huddled together over the table during a recess in the morning's meeting. **********''I didn't think I'd have to go to any more courses before my retirement,'' said an older inspector with more than twenty years in the police.  ''Now we have this retired American cop coming to teach us how to be police. I guess when we finish we can go to Angola and teach them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/04/business/accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Andrea Adelson", "pub_date": "1997-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Family Channel, Virginia Beach, Va., a cable television network owned by International Family Entertainment, to Sloan Group, New York, to handle trade advertising, which had been handled in-house.

The fifth-century kidnapee-turned-cowherd-turned-missionary, the first to convert anyone outside the Roman Empire to Christianity and a big believer in the ascetic hermit-monk approach to life, would probably be just as disgusted with today's plastic shamrocks, green beer and ''kiss me'' buttons as he was with the bacchanalian excesses of the comfortable classes in his own time. **********But seeing the full text of his ''Confessio'' on the World Wide Web, in English translation, with a map, helpful hypertext subheadings and links to his life story, well, that might warm his crosier. **********Patrick was a scholar and teacher as well as a proselytizer. Perhaps his most important legacy was the sowing of literacy, learning and faith in a place where it could survive the Dark Ages mostly intact. Thanks to Patrick and the saints-to-be whom he taught or inspired, the greatest intellectual achievements of Western civilization were safely backed up and archived off site in Ireland while the original Vandals hacked into and crashed the Roman Empire. **********The Internet, with its global cross-linking of vast stores of human knowledge, can be seen as a mammoth electronic recap of his achievement. If Patrick were still the bishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland today, it would be perfectly in character for him to have a home page on the Web. (His latest direct successor, Archbishop Sean Brady, does, in a way: he is featured on the site of the neighboring Catholic Diocese of Kilmore.) **********For an island of only about five million people (in the Republic and the North combined), Ireland and things Irish have an outsized Web presence. The country seems to produce more than its share of innovative Web design talent. And a wide variety of Celtic-themed sites help link the auld sod with its vast diaspora of 50 million or more people. **********Several comprehensive omnibus sites are available on the Web. The oldest and most sophisticated, Paddynet, features a huge searchable Green Pages of Irish-related links, an elaborate chat ''hotel,'' message boards and links to Shop Ireland, offering on-line shopping for all manner of Irish goods. **********Newer and still building are Irlnet (the name comes from the three-letter nationality code displayed on Irish cars) and Every Celtic Thing on the Web, which are more culturally oriented and a bit less commercial. Ireland Online's well-established home page is designed as an all-purpose starting point for Web surfing in general. **********Irish culture is enjoying a worldwide boom in popular attention at the moment, epitomized by two thriving touring stage shows that feature Irish step dancing, ''Riverdance'' and ''Lord of the Dance.'' There is an official ''Riverdance'' Web site that is slick and long on merchandising, much like a Hollywood movie site; the unofficial ''Lord of the Dance'' sites are a bit homier. **********Traditional Irish music is also in the ascendant, led by the Chieftains, the multiple-Grammy-winning warhorses, about whom there are a number of sites sponsored by record companies and fans. An encyclopedic resource for Celtic music -- from the New Age-tinged Clannad to the harp airs of O'Carolan to rockers like U2 and Sinead O'Connor -- is Ceolas, hosted by Stanford University. **********The popular ''Thistle and Shamrock'' radio program, heard on National Public Radio affiliates nationwide, has a companion site. And Green Linnet, which has long been to Irish music what Sun Records was to rhythm and blues, maintains an informative showcase for its artists. **********Centuries of suppression by the English nearly extinguished the Gaelic tongue, but it is still spoken as a first language in rural areas of western Ireland. The Internet is full of resources for students of Irish and its sister tongues, which still barely survive in Scotland and the Isle of Man, Brittany and Wales. A good starting point can be found at the Gaelic site hosted by the University of North Carolina. **********The Irish abroad can stay in touch with news of Roisin Dubh (a Gaelic nickname for Ireland) through the web sites of The Irish Times, one of the best overseas newspaper sites on the Web, and RTE, the Irish counterpart to the BBC. **********Those of Irish descent can get help researching their roots on the Internet. The Irish National Archives offers indexes of important census, tax and other records, though not the records themselves, and the genealogical centers of many Irish county have presences on the Web. **********At the risk of reinforcing a pernicious stereotype, the Irish site with the widest appeal may be the sharp, elaborate Web site of the brewer and distiller, Guinness P.L.C. Visitors can tour the historic brewery at St. James's Gate, Dublin, and learn about the brewing process, the proper way to pull a pint, and the real purpose of the plastic widget in the bottom of a can of stout."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/30/business/diary-352748.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-03-30", "snippet": "Diary of financial events of week ended Mar 30; graph; photos; drawing (M)", "word_count": 1335, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIARY", "print_headline": "DIARY", "body_text": " **********THE GREENSPAN WATCH **********The Fed Finally Does It **********Rarely has anything been so feared, anticipated, talked about, second-guessed, analyzed -- without actually happening. For months, as the economy and the stock market kept whooping it up, all eyes have been on Alan Greenspan. Will he raise rates this time? When will he do it? Why didn't he do it? How did he sleep last night? What did that twitch mean? As the months dragged on, it started to seem that the Federal Reserve would never do it, so when it finally did nudge interest rates higher last week, it was an odd jolt. Apparently Mr. Greenspan wearied of hearing inflation's menacing footsteps around every corner and threw a punch before it even appeared. But the blow, soft as it was, will be felt all through the economy by lifting borrowing rates. And while most economists said the move was about right, some critics, arguing that inflation was extinct, said the move would hurt workers unnecessarily. **********THE BULL MARKET **********Could It Be Over? **********So when stock prices tumbled on Thursday, a full day after the Fed acted, was it a delayed reaction? Don't be silly. Investors' reaction isn't always wise, but it's always instant. No, they're already speculating about the next Fed rate increase, which suddenly seemed more likely -- especially after various economic reports showed the kind of strength that could revive inflation. And the 30-year Treasury bond yield crept above 7 percent, a suddenly enticing alternative to stocks. Yes, the numbers looked scary -- the Dow off 216 at one point, before closing down 140. But remember that at these lofty levels, that's just a 2 percent drop. A decade ago, a 2 percent decline would have been about 40 points. Then again, those same lofty levels mean the Dow has an awfully long way to fall. So will the market crash tomorrow? The answer is a definite maybe. **********GAS AND ELECTRIC **********Cleaner Cars: A Compromise **********General Motors has sold only a few dozen electric cars a month since introducing them in December. No surprise, really. The cars' short range is limiting enough, and who needs to add ''Be sure to plug in the car, Honey'' to lives already strewn with to-do lists? Both drawbacks, though, vanish with the ''hybrid'' car -- gasoline engine plus electric motor. The gas engine either propels the car or charges the battery. No limits, no plugs and a lot less pollution than a gas-only vehicle. And last week Toyota said it would be the first to offer hybrids to a mass market -- for now, though, just a Japanese mass market; it has no immediate plans to sell here. Not only is this a workable compromise on the pollution front, but the price is far less shocking -- less than $20,000, versus $34,000 for G.M.'s electric. **********INVESTMENTS, POOR **********The Perils of Gold Fever **********Gold does strange things to people. Always has. Look at Charlie Chaplin in ''The Gold Rush,'' or Humphrey Bogart in ''Treasure of Sierra Madre.'' History is littered with gold-plated craziness, and investors are by no means immune. When Bre-X Minerals said it had found one of the world's richest gold deposits, in the wilds of Indonesia, investors went wild, turning this little Canadian company, with not much going for it beyond those gold stars in its eyes, into a $1 billion-plus concern. Big-name mutual funds put serious money into the company. And yes, if you'd bought Bre-X stock in early 1995 and sold it last year, you'd have struck serious gold indeed, as the share price went from pennies to $20. Last week, though, just as the gold was scattered to the avenging wind at the end of ''Treasure of Sierra Madre,'' the Bre-X dream got a blast of reality. The company acknowledged that the gold find was probably not nearly what it seemed, and the shares plunged more than 80 percent in a day. **********ACQUISITIONS, DOOMED **********A Costly Gulp of Snapple **********William D. Smithburg, chairman and chief executive of Quaker Oats, has been denied a bonus the last two years. But before the pity wells up in your heart and you mail him that $17 in the cookie jar, consider his imaginative use of stockholders' money. In 1994, Snapple was all the rage, and Quaker was so desperate to acquire it that it paid a price that made jaws drop: $1.7 billion. But Snapple didn't become the next Coke -- Quaker must have expected that it would -- and last week Quaker essentially acknowledged its costly mistake, selling Snapple for a mere $300 million. In other words, nearly $2 million of its investment was wiped out every single day it owned Snapple. Gently, now: put the lid back on the cookie jar. **********UPS AND DOWNS **********A 'Good Time,' Fortune or No **********In 1935, James Ryder, a day laborer, borrowed $100, bought a used Model A truck and soon afterward started a truck-leasing business. Then comes the old rags-to-riches tale: Ryder System was grossing $1.5 million a year by 1946, and when Mr. Ryder quit in 1978 -- in a battle over control of what had become a giant -- he had a $20 million fortune. There the tale loops back again, though, as Mr. Ryder sank his nest egg into the creation of a rival company, Jartran, which within a few years was in bankruptcy. But Mr. Ryder, who died last week at 83, had no regrets. ''I had a good time,'' he said. **********HUMAN CAPITAL **********Today's Widgets: Prisoners **********The debate in Fallsburg, N.Y., revolves around a very modern economic quandary. This struggling Catskills town badly needs new businesses, and the Corrections Corporation of America has bought 185 acres here and wants to build one of its private prisons. Town officials love the idea because a private prison would be taxable property; the prison guards' union hates it because private prisons often hire nonunion workers. Sound familiar? When a business is booming -- and the business of locking people up is certainly booming -- someone will come along and try to do it for less, turn out widgets more efficiently. What's unusual, to put it mildly, is that the widgets this time are human beings. **********BOOK MADNESS **********Have Circus, Will Publish **********What a strange business book publishing is. Here, often, is how a best seller is made: The media, ever on the prowl for a ''hot story,'' latch onto a book and create a circus of publicity; a shopper sees the book, remembers the media circus and buys it. Perhaps, along the way, someone reads the book -- perhaps even likes it -- but that's beside the point. It's irrelevant whether it's literature or, well, just words. Case in point: A buzz begins about a 98-year-old Kansas woman named Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who has written a memoir, and publishers -- possibly remembering the hit ''Having Our Say'' -- claw at each others' tweeds to try to buy it. When the dust settled recently, Warner Books had paid more than $1 million for Mrs. Foveaux's book. Yes, yes, maybe the book's good -- maybe it's not, as a Simon & Schuster executive put it, ''so boring it was unbelievable.'' But that's not the point. Good books don't automatically become best sellers; circuses do. **********TV VIOLENCE **********Don't Touch That Dial! Please? **********Television violence is not about to go away -- at least it hasn't so far, according to a study out last week, and it's still ''sanitized and glamorized,'' with punishment rare. So for those who want to shield children, the question remains: How? Those new ratings don't look promising, the study says, because the old ''forbidden-fruit syndrome'' kicks in. If a show is rated TV-M (mature audiences only), a teen-ager will say, ''Bring it on!'' And anything with a Y (all children) will elicit a resounding ''Yuk!'' So it's really simple: just label the nastiest stuff Y, and the kids won't go near it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/20/business/federal-agents-step-up-pressure-in-columbia-hca-investigation.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1997-08-20", "snippet": "Federal agents, stepping up pressure on potential witnesses in criminal investigation of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp, have been making nighttime visits to homes of some of company employees in Florida, trying to persuade them to cooperate with in...", "word_count": 721, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Federal Agents Step Up Pressure in Columbia/HCA Investigation", "print_headline": "Federal Agents Step Up Pressure in Columbia/HCA Investigation", "body_text": " **********Stepping up the pressure on potential witnesses in the criminal investigation of the Columbia/ HCA Healthcare Corporation, Federal agents have been making nighttime visits to the homes of some company employees in Florida, trying to persuade them to cooperate with the inquiry and provide evidence to the Government. **********In addition, agents have served more subpoenas in Florida, increasing the number of executives compelled to appear before one of the grand juries investigating the unfolding scandal at the company.

Jarrell, chief executive of Columbia's southwest Florida division; Michael T. Neeb, chief financial officer of its Jacksonville, Fla., division, and Robert W. Whiteside, a reimbursement director at the company's headquarters in Nashville -- said little in the short arraignment before United States Magistrate George T. Swartz. **********It was the executives' first appearance in court since the indictment against them was unsealed in late July. The indictment was handed up under seal on June 25, weeks before Federal agents conducted a sweeping raid on Columbia's hospitals and offices in a number of states. **********During today's hearing, Kathleen Haley, the assistant United States attorney in the case, asked if Columbia was paying the legal fees of the three executives, and raised questions about whether that would present a conflict of interest for their lawyers. **********Columbia itself is a target of the investigation, raising the possibility that its defense might conflict with that of the three executives. **********Under questioning from the magistrate, the executives' lawyers did not disclose whether they were being paid by the company, which is a frequent practice in cases in which executives are indicted for actions taken on behalf of a company. But the lawyers denied there was any conflict of interest even if Columbia was paying the bills. **********''There is nothing unusual or improper with a corporation paying'' for executives' legal bills, said Peter F. George, a lawyer for Mr. Jarrell. ''This is permitted by law and by the ethics of our profession.'' **********The issue was resolved after the executives agreed to waive any potential conflict stemming from Columbia's payment of legal bills that might arise later in the case."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/28/business/business-digest-833568.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 552, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Dow Plunges 554 Points; Exchanges Close Early **********Stocks tumbled around the world, and on Wall Street, markets were forced to end trading earlier than planned. **********The Dow industrials lost 554.26 points, or 7.2 percent, closing at 7,161.15, but no one knew just how far stocks might have skidded had not market rules -- adopted in the wake of the crash 10 years ago -- required markets to close at 3:30 P.M., half an hour early.

The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.64 percent, from 6.63 percent Friday. **********That afternoon bond rally, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, led to the turnaround in the Dow, which had been down as much as 66 points in the early afternoon.

Roberts Jr., an investment banker at Bear, Stearns & Company who has advised the Nynex Corporation on its planned $22 billion merger with the Bell Atlantic Corporation, last April. **********With deregulation now the law of the land, most experts believe that the telephone business can only become more competitive this year. The tougher economic realities that competition will bring also suggest that more phone companies will pursue mergers or takeovers. **********But the onset of competition will be a messy, hard-fought process -- with the long-distance and local carriers haggling over every nuance of the rules of engagement. And those detours into court could further delay the free-market free-for-all that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was meant to uncork. **********''Our early experience is that it takes a long time to get even a modest, controlled rollout of competition,'' John D. Zeglis, general counsel of the AT&T Corporation, said. Already, the GTE Corporation and other local phone companies have persuaded a Federal appeals court to suspend new Government regulations on how the local phone companies must open up their local networks to AT&T and other rivals. GTE contends that the Federal Communications Commission has no jurisdiction to set these so-called interconnection rules. **********The next phase of rule-making -- in which the F.C.C. will revamp the web of subsidies that guarantee universal telephone service -- could ignite fresh legal challenges. **********''This could be as contentious, or even more contentious, than the interconnection rules, since universal service is about real money,'' said Scott Cleland, managing director of the Schwab Washington Research Group, a consulting firm. **********Among other things, the Clinton Administration is pushing for the phone companies to pledge to wire the nation's schools and hospitals for high-speed access to the Internet -- an ambitious program that could add $2.25 billion to the cost of providing universal phone service. **********The trouble is that under the new rules the 50 states will be responsible for collecting the subsidies that guarantee universal service. So if the F.C.C. were to make such a provision part of the new universal service regulations, Mr. Cleland predicted that at least one state government would immediately challenge the rules in court. **********New kinds of competition will not necessarily wait for all these court cases to be settled. AT&T is already offering local phone service to a small number of customers in Sacramento, Calif., Mr. Zeglis said. And the Ameritech Corporation, which offers local service in five Midwestern states, plans to file for permission to offer long distance next week. **********''We can start competing in spite of the court case,'' said Richard C. Notebaert, chairman of Ameritech, which has signed interconnection agreements with about a dozen would-be competitors, including the MFS Communications Company and Time Warner Inc. **********As the long-distance and local carriers invade each other's markets, they will probably continue to seek partners -- extending a wave of consolidation that began last year with the back-to-back mergers of Bell Atlantic with Nynex and SBC Communications Inc. with Pacific Telesis Group. **********''You'll see more mergers because you've still got several companies hanging out there,'' said Alex J. Mandl, the former president of AT&T, who stunned the industry last August when he left to take over an obscure wireless company, Associated Communications. **********Some of the most obvious pairings, like the two Bell deals, were done in 1996. Even the takeover of the MCI Communications Corporation by British Telecommunications P.L.C. was not completely unexpected, since British Telecommunications has owned 20 percent of MCI since 1994. **********Still, investment bankers sketched out several other deals that would put together long-distance and local carriers. GTE, which explored an alliance with MCI before the British Telecommunications merger was announced, is still eager to join forces with another major carrier, according to people familiar with the company. AT&T looms as the most obvious candidate, since its long-distance network would mesh well with GTE's sprawling local presence. **********Companies that provide alternative local phone service could also prove alluring to long-distance carriers seeking to expand into the $90 billion local phone business. The largest of these companies, Teleport Communications Group, has been rumored to be a takeover target for months. **********And while the British Telecommunications-MCI combination may raise thorny regulatory issues, analysts predict it will not be the last cross-border alliance. They suggest that Sprint could eventually be acquired by its European partners, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, each of which currently owns 10 percent of Sprint. **********What does all this activity portend for consumers? Experts said the rise of competition -- and even the spate of deals -- could reduce certain phone rates. Indeed, there are signs that the creation of a trans-Atlantic telephone company in British Telecommunications-MCI could erode the system of artificially inflated calling rates between the United States and Europe. **********Yet in the domestic local phone business, where the most revolutionary changes were supposed to occur, the outlook for consumers is murky. The regional Bell companies are zealously defending their local franchises. And long-distance carriers like AT&T and MCI are focusing on business customers ahead of the less profitable residential market. **********''The real disappointment of the telecom act is that there is going to be very little residential competition,'' Mr. Cleland said. **********That may be overly pessimistic. But given the raft of lawsuits that seems likely to tie up the process in the courts through this year, it is possible that this new era of telecommunications will be known for now less for its cheaper monthly bills than for its expensive wheeling and dealing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/15/business/giant-eagle-to-buy-riser-foods-for-403-million.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GIANT EAGLE TO BUY RISER FOODS FOR $403 MILLION", "print_headline": "GIANT EAGLE TO BUY RISER FOODS FOR $403 MILLION", "body_text": " **********Riser Foods Inc. agreed yesterday to be acquired by Giant Eagle Inc. for $403 million in cash and assumed debt.

While President Nelson Mandela's promises of new housing, new jobs and better schools remain far behind schedule, the Government-owned power company has brought electricity to more than two million new households. Now half the households in South Africa are wired for electricity, up from about a third six years ago. **********But access to electric power does not mean that people are trading in their coal stoves for electric heaters and ranges. **********Far from it. Even though the power company arranged for lessons in how to use appliances and gave away irons, hot plates and electric kettles in some areas, a year later many are gathering dust. **********With all the promise of a better life that electrification brings, in South Africa electricity has arrived in villages and squatter camps long before paychecks and worldly ways. Power-company executives say they have come to realize that without improvements in other areas, the impact of electricity is limited. **********The power company has learned some hard lessons in the last few years. More than six years into the electrification project, company executives say they are hemorrhaging money and electricity use remains far below the levels they had counted on. On average they are subsidizing the new hookups to the tune of $84 per household per year. **********Some of the problem is simply poverty. Buying appliances has proved far beyond the reach of many South Africans. But experts say that the company, Eskom, which generates 97 percent of the country's energy and half the energy used elsewhere on the African continent, also failed to calculate the pull of habit and the choices people would make when they finally were able to flip that switch. **********''What we have seen is that electricity does not improve people's lives all alone,'' said Thula Bopela, Eskom's National Electrification Planning Manager. ''It has to be linked to roads, water, jobs and development in general.'' **********Some Eskom executives believe now that only the next generation will really embrace plug-in conveniences. **********Even the Eskom executive in charge of electrification in the huge black township of Soweto, Silos Zimu, said he has not been able to get his parents to abandon coal. ''They think it heats better,'' Mr. Zimu said. ''You cannot convince them otherwise.'' **********Televisions, not household appliances, are often people's first major purchase when electricity arrives. Unfortunately for the power company's balance sheet, television sets are expensive, so it takes people a long time to save enough money to buy one in a country where the average household income is below $3,000 a year. And they do not draw much more power than a light bulb. Often, too, people have been more interested in refrigeration during the hot months than in changing their heating and cooking techniques. In urban squatter camps and some other areas, people had often used car batteries or other means to obtain some electricity, so wiring their homes has not necessarily made a major change in their life styles. **********In rural areas, electricity must compete against other fuels, including wood and cow dung, which cost nothing but the effort of gathering them. In some areas, too, a coal stove is still a status symbol while electric appliances are considered extravagances. Another problem is that when appliances break, there is nowhere to get them repaired. In the end, many households have been using electricity for lighting only. **********Even in Soweto, this country's biggest, most sophisticated township, where a few houses sport satellite dishes and two-car garages, the coal carts still ply the streets at their laconic pace. Like summertime ice cream trucks, they blow whistles or toot horns to signal their arrival. **********In winter, Government pollution monitors say, the air quality here is among the worst in the world. It is not just coal -- there is industry upwind, people burn garbage openly and the cars kick up showers of dust on unpaved roads. But coal is a major factor. And the much-improved delivery of electricity has made hardly a dent. **********''The coal stove is a social gathering place -- you cannot sit around a radiator,'' said Jabu Sithole, a longtime Soweto resident and chairman of the local branch of the National Association for Clean Air. ''Some people also have a very deep belief that food cooked on coal tastes better.'' **********Eskom still aims to provide electricity to 300,000 new homes a year until 1999. At that point, about 72 percent of the country's 8.8 million dwellings should have electricity. **********But the company has had to drastically revise its estimates of when it would begin making money on its new customers. It had estimated that at the end of 10 years, the average connected household would be using a relatively modest 350 kilowatt-hours per month. Right now, the average stands at 86. **********The company has been revising its strategies for who will get electricity and when. In the past, decisions about who got electricity first were based on the cost of the hookup. If it was cheap to wire a township or a squatter camp because it was a high density area near the main power lines, it was done. **********Now, the agency is becoming more open to capital outlays if there is a good chance that the households at the end of the line will be large users of electricity. ''We got wise,'' Mr. Bopela, the Eskom planning manager, said, ''when we saw ourselves bleeding to death financially.'' **********Mr. Bopela said Eskom is also considering a pilot program to deliver very low-amperage electricity to areas where the people are so poor that they will undoubtedly use the electricity only for lighting. This could save as much as $250 per hookup. Upgrading later would be possible and not terribly expensive, Mr. Bopela said. **********Until now, all of Eskom's new connections have delivered enough electricity to power households outfitted with dozens of appliances, from air-conditioners to microwaves. With low average household incomes and millions of people living in one-room shacks, the decision to provide hookups with such power capacity seems in retrospect like overkill. **********''We have learned a lot,'' Mr. Bopela said. ''If we see that people are still going to use coal or paraffin and only want us for lights, then that is what we should give and nothing more.'' **********The fact that people are not using the electricity much does not mean there has been no enthusiasm for it.  Even in the poorest areas, residents have pushed hard to be hooked up. **********But in the end, many people stick with the familiar old ways. Electricity may not be more expensive than some of the other fuels, but a family can watch a monthly ration of coal being used up and calculate what it can afford. The cost of using electricity, on the other hand, often remains invisible until a family's income is spent. And recipes learned on a coal stove or open fire have to be retuned for a hot plate. **********Riverose Mcathi, who lives in the White City section of Soweto, was out on the street recently signaling ''the coal man'' to fill a tin bin by her front door. Her house, one of the thousands of identical dwellings built for blacks by the former Government decades ago, has had electricity since 1984. But she has not given up her coal stove. **********''With the coal stove you heat the house and you can put the pots on it,'' Mrs. Mcathi said. ''It is true that you can feel it in the air in the winter when people are using it a lot, but it is only for a few months and it is cheaper.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/04/business/in-school-and-saving.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-05-04", "snippet": "Excerpts from essays by children Matt Horesta, Alexander Gertel and Amy Lauren Anderson on learning about money and investing from essay contest sponsored by Stein Roe & Farnham, mutual fund company in Chicago (M)", "word_count": 667, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In School, and Saving", "print_headline": "In School, and Saving", "body_text": " **********Children aren't so different from you and me.

The question was: What are the most important things you have learned about money and investing, and how will this knowledge help you in the future? **********Among the more than 1,200 entrants, from grades 5 through 7, several themes emerged. A common sentiment was that banks are a place where your money grows very slowly. For all the bankers out there trying to sell mutual funds and other investments, those responses suggest a prickly image problem. **********Many children described saving as the first step on their way to financial competency. Some had innovative approaches worked out with their parents; others talked about specific formulas, like saving 10 percent of everything earned, whether from pet-sitting or doing household chores. A few said they set aside as much as half or two-thirds of their earnings or cash gifts to help build a college fund. **********Then there were a few other widely held beliefs that have sent investors of all ages down ill-chosen paths: stocks always go up; you can always sell houses for more than you paid for them, and you will do well buying a stock if you like the company's product. **********Following are excerpts from three of the essays: **********WHEN I was 6, my grandfather began to teach me about the stock market. He told me I needed to learn how to invest intelligently although at the time, I'm not sure I knew what that meant. He taught me how to read The Wall Street Journal and how to follow stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Nasdaq . . . **********When my grandfather thought I was beginning to get a handle on investing, he gave me $150 to invest in a stock of my choice. Foolishly, I disregarded everything he taught me, and I invested with my heart. I chose a stock of a minor league baseball park in my state that was listed on the Nasdaq. I love to play baseball, and this park reminded me of ''Field of Dreams.'' I was sure this was a sound investment, but from the day I bought it, it has continued to lose money. And last month, there was a 1-for-10 reverse split! Today, my 48 shares are 4 shares and my investment is worth $1. What a lesson that was! **********Matt Horesta **********7th grade, Pompton Plains, N.J. **********BEFORE you invest money you have to make it. The way I do this is by using coupons at the grocery store. Every week I cut out the coupons of products we use. My mother makes a list of the items we are going to buy. Then my father and I go to the store with the coupons and the list. When we pay for the groceries, I hand the coupons to the cashier, and he or she scans them. The savings show up on the receipt. When we get home, my father adds up the savings, and I write the amount saved in a notebook. I save approximately $10 per week. (That is over $500 per year.) I put half of this savings in mutual funds, and I am able to spend the other half . . . **********Alexander Gertel **********5th grade, Mequon, Wis. **********MY grandparents have been a good example to me.

I'm a 25-year-old starving student in New York. Last year my parents removed $30,000 from my UGMA account because they disapprove of my life style. I got stuck with the tax bill, and a lawyer advised me that it's not worth trying to get the money back. What can I do? **********A.  Isn't it supposed to be the other way around -- students cleaning out their parents en route to a college degree? **********Heading off to the University of Michigan, I managed to smuggle out my mother's toaster oven, hot plate, tape deck, 11-inch TV and two sets of Martex sheets. Of course, the neighbors wondered why I was packing the car wearing a full-length, goose-down coat in the middle of August. **********As for recovering your money, you may want to get another lawyer. While some accountants told me that your parents have done nothing worse than take a hammer to a piggy bank that they had already filled, other experts see thievery. Under New York law, they point out, the money in your UGMA account (named for the Uniform Gift to Minors Act) was supposed to go to you at age 21, no strings attached. The age varies from state to state, from 18 to 25. **********After the child reaches the designated age, ''it would be clearly illegal for the parents or any other custodian to remove the funds for their own use, even if they've fallen into dire straits,'' said Don Young, a lawyer specializing in estate planning at the Manhattan firm of Tunick, Kupferman, Creadore & Young P.C. **********Despite this constraint, however, many wealthy parents and grandparents use UGMA accounts to give a child up to $10,000 a year. The accounts, available in all states under either the UGMA statute or a broader law known as the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, have two attractions: The gifts are tax-free to donors, enabling them to whittle down their estates and perhaps avoid inheritance taxes. And when the child reaches age 14, the earnings are taxed at a lower rate -- usually 15 percent -- than they often would be if the parents' rate had applied. (If the earnings are less than $650, no tax applies at any age.) **********But when the taxes are due on your account's earnings, you should pay up if your parents don't. Whatever your quarrel with your folks, all the Internal Revenue Service knows is that the UGMA was in your name and, therefore, you owe the money. **********The Uniform Gift to Minors Act specifically provides that once money has been transferred to such an account, the donor cannot take it back. And any withdrawals  must directly benefit the child. While many parents set up UGMA accounts specifically to deal with soaring college costs, the law allows the custodian to make reasonable expenditures for many activities, like summer camp, music or riding lessons, orthodontics or a computer. Not included are costs that are typically the sole responsibility of parents, like utility bills or the mortgage. **********But there apparently is no such benefit with your disappearing UGMA. Nor can  your parents now claim to be retroactively reimbursing themselves for years of child-rearing expenses -- as in, ''Oops, we forgot to take out money for that S.A.T. prep course in 1989.'' **********''She should definitely attempt to recover the full value of the account,'' said David A. Baker, a lawyer in the Chicago office of McDermott, Will & Emery. ''Depending on the depositors' contract when the account was opened, she may also be able to file an action against the bank or investment firm  that released the funds to her parents after she came of age.'' **********If your parents had removed the money before you turned 21, when they still had a right of access to the account, you would most likely have found it more difficult, if not impossible, to recover it. They probably could have produced receipts to prove that the withdrawals were for your benefit. **********''The only instance when it's fairly easy to prove parental misappropriation of UGMA funds,'' Mr. Baker said, ''is when there's a divorce, and the parent found to be spending the money irresponsibly is the parent who does not have legal custody of the child.'' **********Part of the problem with parental misappropriation is that most banks and brokerage firms have no system for notifying UGMA beneficiaries when they become eligible to withdraw the money. Nor is there a mechanism to discourage or prevent the parental donors, as long as they are also custodians of the account, from tapping into the funds even after the child comes of age. **********''The system is not really set up to keep parents from raiding the accounts -- just the kids,'' said Mitchell Slater, a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Roseland, N.J., who specializes in financial planning for children. **********Terry Savage, the author of several personal-finance books, added, ''Many parents  purposely keep the accounts secret to prevent the money from being squandered.'' **********In fact, Mr. Young said, some parents leave the money parked in the accounts long after the beneficiary has come of age. He has encountered parents who use UGMA's to pay the occasional bill, too, although he  had never heard of parents' completely reclaiming an account. **********UGMA accounts can be very valuable; those of affluent families can often be well into the six figures, which can mean sizable tax savings. **********But some experts suggest that the accounts, even without their constraints, may not always be worth the effort. **********'I'm not a big fan of UGMA's,'' said Kalman A. Chany, author of ''Paying For College Without Going Broke'' (Princeton Review, $18). ''You may be jeopardizing your chances for financial aid in return for a few hundred dollars in tax savings.'' Colleges deem 35 percent of assets in a child's name to be fair game for tuition, he explained, while for parents' assets the figure is only up to 5.65 percent. **********To those who think they are too well-off to qualify for financial aid, Mr. Chany cautioned that, through divorce or downsizing, circumstances can change. **********''It's better to buy growth stocks in your own name and then, if it does not look like you'll get financial aid, start gifting the securities that have appreciated into an UGMA when your child is in high school,'' Mr. Chany said. ''He can then later sell the securities to pay for tuition, and all the capital gains will still be taxed at the child's rate.'' **********Although planners are sorting out the effects on financial-aid eligibility and other matters, new vehicles are being created for college savers, too. In the tax package this summer, for example, Congress created a so-called education I.R.A. that allows investors to escape tax on earnings used for school expenses, even after the money is withdrawn. And in the higher-education savings plans that more and more states are authorizing, earnings are taxed, but not until withdrawal. **********Mr. Young also has little use for UGMA's. ''If you set up an UGMA of which you are also the custodian, and you die before the funds are turned over to the beneficiary, then the account will be taxed as part of your estate,'' he said. **********What is the lesson in all this? If you are a parent tempted to use those UGMA dollars for something other than your child's benefit, just remember Leonard Bernstein's father. When criticized for not giving his multitalented child more encouragement, he said, ''How was I to know he would grow up to be Leonard Bernstein?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/08/world/two-swiss-banks-plan-a-merger-forming-global-financial-giant.html": {"writer_name": "John With", "pub_date": "1997-12-08", "snippet": "Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp will merge, creating world's second-largest bank and world's biggest money-management company; new entity, United Bank of Switzerland, will control $592 billion in total assets; Marcel Ospel, Swiss Ban...", "word_count": 1115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Swiss Banks Plan a Merger, Forming Global Financial Giant", "print_headline": "Two Swiss Banks Plan a Merger, Forming Global Financial Giant", "body_text": " **********Two banking giants, Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation, announced early today that they planned to merge, creating the world's second largest bank. **********The proposed merger would be one of the largest corporate deals ever, and it is the latest in a recent series of deals in the global market for financial services. Banking companies in Europe, like those in the United States, have been on a buying spree to expand their markets and increase their ability to compete around the world while cutting costs. **********The companies said that the merger, which was announced at a news conference in Zurich, before the opening of European financial markets, would lead to cuts of as many as 13,000 jobs worldwide -- 7,000 of the two banks' 40,000 jobs in Switzerland, and another 6,000 among their roughly 18,000 overseas employees. The job losses are likely to fall heavily on the banks' operations in New York; both banks are among the largest foreign financial institutions in the United States. **********The combined bank is to be called United Bank of Switzerland, with corporate and consumer banking operations headquartered in Zurich, while the private banking unit will be based in Basel. It would control $592 billion in total assets, putting it behind the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi of Japan, which controls $696 billion in assets. **********By contrast, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the largest American banking company, with $340 billion in assets, does not even rank in the top 10 of the world's banks in terms of assets. **********A merger of Union Bank and Swiss Bank would also create the world's biggest money-management company, surpassing the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments. **********Banking industry analysts said the deal would encourage other large financial companies around the world to pursue mergers of their own to remain competitive. **********''This will ring the bell for everybody around the world,'' said John Keefe, who runs Keefe Worldwide Information Services in New York. ''This will be a signal to the top few players that they have to increase their scale. Morgan and Citibank and Chase will have to think about what they are going to do.'' **********Some details of the merger were unclear last night, but Marcel Ospel, the tough Swiss banking executive who until now has run the Swiss Bank Corporation, which is based in Basel, was appointed as chief executive of the combined bank. Mathis Cabiallavetta, who is now chief executive of Union Bank, which is headquartered in Zurich, the Swiss banking capital, was appointed the new bank's chairman. **********The deal involves an exchange of stock. Shareholders of Union Bank, Switzerland's largest banking company, are to own 60 percent of the equity in the new bank, while shareholders of Swiss Bank, which ranks No. 3, are to own the remainder. The merger will require the approval of shareholders as well as Swiss antitrust authorities. Shareholder votes on the merger are to take place on Feb. 3 and 4. **********Rumors that the banks were about to make an announcement buoyed the stock prices of both banks in recent days. **********But the Swiss banks have been struggling in recent years, and the banks reported their first losses ever last year, as the Swiss economy was hurt by recession, and as the traditional fortresses of the Swiss in asset management and international investment banking were assailed by revitalized American institutions like Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan, Goldman, Sachs and others. **********Changing economic conditions around the world, as well as the slump in Switzerland, are the driving forces for the deal. The merger, though, does come at a time when Switzerland's banks, and notably Union Bank, have also come under heavy fire for their handling of the accounts of victims of the Nazis. This week, the banks got a brief respite after a three-month moratorium was announced by United States city and state financial officers who had threatened punitive action. In coming months, however, the banks are expected to face mounting pressure to reach an out-of-court settlement in New York, where they face class-action suits from Holocaust survivors and their heirs. **********Union Bank came under particular criticism earlier this year, after a security guard came across documents relating to the sale of Jewish property in Germany being shredded in the bank's basement. The guard passed them to a Swiss Jewish organization. The guard, Christoph Meili, was dismissed from his job, and later fled to the United States, where Congress accorded him and his family residence rights. **********Reports of possible mergers swirled through the world of international finance at least since last year, when an approach by Credit Suisse, the No. 2 Swiss banking group, unsuccessfully broached the idea of a merger to Union Bank. Undaunted, Credit Suisse announced earlier this year an $8.8 billion takeover of the big Winterthur Insurance Company. This regrouping, plus a surge in net profits thus far this year, as the big Swiss banks cashed in on increased earnings on securities trading on the world's bull markets, have caused Swiss bank stocks to catch fire recently, rebounding strongly after several years of weak performance. **********In addition to long-established commercial banking businesses in the United States, both Union Bank and Swiss Bank have a broad range of other financial service companies. In recent years, the Swiss Bank Corporation acquired O'Connor, a Chicago derivatives business; S. G. Warburg, a British investment bank with a sizable Wall Street presence, and Dillon Read, a venerable old-line American investment bank with blue chip clients, but with a declining market share in the main Wall Street businesses. Union Bank, for its part, has tended to acquire teams and individuals to bolster its ambitious plans for the United States. It was Mr. Ospel who, in 1995, persuaded Swiss Bank to take over Warburg. **********A merger of Union Bank and the Swiss Bank Corporation would create a mammoth money management company, with assets under management of more than one trillion Swiss francs, about $670 billion, pushing it past Fidelity Investments in the United States as the world's biggest money managing company. Union Bank's position as the world's No. 3 money manager came under assault last month, after Merrill Lynch announced it will acquire the Mercury Asset Management Group of Britain for $5.2 billion. The acquisition raised Merrill Lynch's assets to $450 billion. **********The merger is the latest move in a scramble among European banks and insurers to restructure their businesses as the introduction of a single European currency approaches. Since Switzerland, which is not a member of the 15-nation European Union, will not take part in the union, its banks are hustling to get access to the single currency area through acquisitions and cooperation accords. Thus in August, Union Bank paid $196 million to acquire Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst, a Frankfurt private bank, in a move to expand in Germany."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/18/business/20-million-trading-loss-for-bankboston.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-11-18", "snippet": "BankBoston Corp says it had trading loss in October of $20 million in securities and foreign exchange after volatility in Latin America and Asian markets (S)", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "$20 Million Trading Loss for BankBoston", "print_headline": "$20 Million Trading Loss for BankBoston", "body_text": " **********The BankBoston Corporation reported today that it had a trading loss in October of $20 million in securities and foreign exchange after volatility in Latin American and Asian markets. **********BankBoston earned about $49 million, or 11 percent of its noninterest income in the third quarter, from the combination of trading profits, foreign exchange profits and securities gains.

Though putting land dealers to death has been denounced by some Palestinians, Palestinian leaders of all leanings strongly support banning land sales to Jews. **********Last week, Bassam Eid, head of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitor and a sharp critic of the Palestinian Authority, said his group's position is that ''selling land to Jews is a national crime and should be punished by the Palestinian Authority.'' **********The Palestinian argument is that lands purchased by Jews are thereafter claimed by Israel as its sovereign territory, and therefore that any Arab who sells land is a traitor. **********The sentiment has become acute since the start of construction of a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem on land that was originally purchased from Arabs. **********''I have no objection to any Israeli, a Jew, I mean, to buy a home in Gaza, under one condition, that he will live under the sovereignty of the Palestinians,'' Mr. Abu Middein told Israel Army Radio today. ''This is the main question because the land in the West Bank and particularly in Jerusalem, the Israeli Government considers any private property of the Jew, it is automatically their political sovereignty.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/02/business/manic-market-investor-s-guide-some-small-stock-funds-haven-turmoil.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1997-11-02", "snippet": "Article on some small-stock mutual funds that weathered stock market's downturn better than most (M)", "word_count": 573, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Some Small-Stock Funds, A Haven From the Turmoil", "print_headline": "THE MANIC MARKET: AN INVESTOR'S GUIDE; In Some Small-Stock Funds, A Haven From the Turmoil", "body_text": " **********LOOKING for ports in a storm? Some stock mutual funds with decent long-term records performed quite acceptably during the market swoon of this summer and fall that culminated in Monday's plunge. But it was almost impossible to find a fund with a good previous record that did well during the four days of terror that ended last Monday. **********The standout funds during the swoon were the Evergreen Limited Market fund and the Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company fund. Both invest in very small companies, which weathered the downturn better than most. **********The Dow Jones industrial average peaked on Aug. 6 at 8,259.31 and then fell 13.3 percent through the panic-stricken early close on Monday. Small-stock indexes continued to climb after the Dow peaked, however, and ended on Monday about where they were in early August. **********Over all, the best-performing mutual fund over that period was a fund that buys small stocks in Britain, the DFA United Kingdom Small Company fund; it went up 14.2 percent. Alas, it had been down earlier in 1997 and has a mediocre record in recent years. (It was, however, a top performer back in the year that ended Sept. 30, 1987, just before that year's crash. Maybe this is a fund that should be monitored by those looking for signs of a new crash.) **********Energy stocks did well during much of the swoon, which is what allowed Fidelity's Select Energy Service fund to make the list of top performers. It also has a good long-term record but alone does not make for a diversified portfolio. **********The Evergreen and Bridgeway funds were joined by a newer fund, Franklin Micro Cap Value I, as good performers during the down period. All three invest in very small companies, often with market values of less than $100 million, which Wall Street is likely to ignore. **********The other funds that did well -- to no one's surprise -- were the bear funds. Rydex Ursa, which has been betting against the bull for a long time, went up 10.75 percent during the period. That did not, however, erase its losses so far in 1997. Lighthouse Growth, which plans to change its name to Lighthouse Contrarian, also did well. It, too, has been shorting a lot of stocks. **********''We've felt the stock market was getting to be a speculative bubble,'' said Kevin Duffy, the fund's manager. The Lighthouse fund had, however, done little more than break even in 1997 through Aug. 6. **********And what funds sank in the tempest-tossed seas? **********This panic began in Asia, and it should come as no surprise that foreign funds dominated the losers' list for both periods. Asian funds did the worst for the post-August swoon, and Latin American funds fared the worst in the four terrible days. For most of the summer, Latin markets had ignored the Asian troubles, but the worldwide panic hit them hard at the end. **********Among American funds, some of the biggest winners when the market was soaring ranked among the worst performers when the bull ran into trouble. Technology funds were the big losers for the August-to-October period, while the four-day crunch saw carnage as well among some aggressive-growth funds. **********And the lessons for the future? They are murky, indeed. **********Funds that do well in bear markets are unlikely to have been leaders in bull markets. Historically, small stocks tend to do worse than big ones in bear markets, but that did not happen when this market fell apart. There is no guarantee that pattern will repeat itself."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/23/world/out-of-spotlight-violence-tears-at-mexican-state.html": {"writer_name": "Julia Preston", "pub_date": "1997-05-23", "snippet": "Tensions and violence in Chiapas Indian hamlet of San Pedro Nixtalucum is linked, at least in part, to edgy, undeclared truce between Mexican Government and Zapatista rebels; rebels are penned up in jungle strongholds by troops and have lost nearl...", "word_count": 963, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Out of Spotlight, Violence Tears at Mexican State", "print_headline": "Out of Spotlight, Violence Tears at Mexican State", "body_text": " **********The dispute started with the indiscretion of two peeping Toms who crouched in the shade of a coffee tree to watch a woman bathing. **********But by the time the violence here subsided two days later, four villagers were shot dead, six state police officers were beaten, 27 people landed in jail and nearly 400 people, including many children, were forced to flee into the forest. **********San Pedro Nixtalucum is one of hundreds of Indian hamlets clinging to steep mountain slopes in the humid uplands of the state of Chiapas. It is a long way from the low-lying Chiapas jungles where Zapatista guerrillas staged an uprising in 1994. **********But the violence that followed a simple quarrel over an offense to a woman's modesty had much to do with the Zapatista rebellion. It was one of many violent incidents in Chiapas this year that revealed the costs of the Government's strategy of postponing the peace with the rebels. **********More than three years after the Zapatistas seized a Chiapas city to draw attention to the exploitation of the region's Indians, the guerrillas and the Government have settled into an edgy, undeclared truce, with the rebels penned up in their jungle strongholds by Government troops. Peace talks stalled last September. **********The rebels have lost nearly all their political momentum. As the peace talks faltered over deep differences between President Ernesto Zedillo and Zapatista leaders, the guerrillas' international limelight faded while the army reinforced its control across the state, setting up garrisons in the most remote corners. **********While making no concessions to the rebels, the Government poured  resources into non-Zapatista communities for new road, health and school projects. This won the showdown for Mr. Zedillo, but at a price. Across Chiapas the lack of peace has aggravated age-old village disputes and deepened new rifts, bringing back the explosive tensions that existed before the Zapatista revolt. **********''We are beginning to see desperation in the Indian communities,'' said Bishop Raul Vera Lopez, a leader of the Roman Catholic diocese that includes most of the Indian regions of Chiapas. ''We see a harder line from the army and the police, and we don't see signs that the Government really wants a negotiated solution.'' **********The inhabitants of San Pedro are Tzotzil Indians who declare their identity by scarlet designs embroidered on their clothes. They grow coffee and corn using hoes much like those their Mayan ancestors used more than a millennium ago. **********San Pedro was one of many highland villages rocked by the Zapatista rebellion. A pro-Zapatista faction rejected the decades-old rule of village leaders allied with the Government's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, setting up a parallel government with its own mayor and justice of the peace -- even a two-man police force. **********When the wife of a Presbyterian pastor, Nicolas Gomez Perez, caught two village policemen from the pro-Government faction spying on her while she washed herself in a coffee grove in March, he appealed to the opposition authorities ''to make justice'' for him, opposition leaders recounted in interviews at a muddy campsite across a valley from San Pedro where they sought refuge after the incident. **********The pastor's complaint prompted a melee between rival camps armed with rocks and wooden clubs. But villagers on both sides said they were about to sign a peace pact when state police and army troops stormed in on March 14. Four opposition villagers were killed by the troops. **********The opposition group attacked the police with clubs in a failed attempt to block the arrest of 27 villagers from their side. The remaining opposition members gathered their families and fled through the forests to a friendly hamlet. $(On May 17, the Zapatistas mobilized several thousand Indian sympathizers to escort the displaced back to their homes.$) **********In San Pedro, state police officers who set up a sandbag bivouac in the town square whiled away their time playing basketball with the children. Residents waited before a shaky wooden table outside the PRI mayor's office to sign up with a representative of a state farm program to receive free fertilizer. None of the opposition residents would get fertilizer because they were all camped on the knoll across the valley. **********''The Government wants the Indians to fight among themselves so it can bring troops into our communities and break up our organizations,''  said Santos Perez Perez, a pro-Zapatista leader from San Pedro. **********At least 20 people have been killed  this year in other violence in Indian communities outside the Zapatista-controlled zone, and thousands of peasants were displaced from their homes. There are signs that both pro-  and anti-Zapatista civilian groups are arming themselves with guns. **********On one hand, PRI followers have formed two armed anti-Zapatista vigilante groups. One, called Justice and Peace, has been implicated in 11 killings. Last August its mobs attacked a convoy carrying observers from Human Rights Watch, an American monitoring group, and in February they shot and wounded a Mexican human rights observer. **********But many shooting victims have been PRI followers and state police officers. On March 7 two policemen were killed by Indians who had illegally invaded land. **********However, in April, a Human Rights Watch report concluded that state authorities contributed to the frictions by swiftly prosecuting crimes in which PRI followers were victims but failing to pursue crimes against Government opponents. **********The authorities are clamping down on the many foreigners the Zapatista movement has attracted to Chiapas.  This month the Government ordered the expulsion of 12 who joined a march by displaced Indians demanding to be returned to their homes. **********Acknowledging the need for detente, Gov. Julio Cesar Ruiz Ferro of Chiapas set up a commission to mediate Indian disputes. But many Indian leaders distrust the Governor, who is from the PRI. They refused to work with the commission until more than 80 prisoners they regard as political detainees are freed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/07/world/turkey-may-free-activist-before-prime-minister-visits-us.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1997-12-07", "snippet": "Turkish Government may free 36-year-old Leyla Zana, country's most prominent political prisoner, before visit of Prime Min Mesut Yilmaz to US; Zana, former member of Parliament convicted of supporting Kurdish terrorism and sentenced to 15-year jai...", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turkey May Free Activist Before Prime Minister Visits U.S.", "print_headline": "Turkey May Free Activist Before Prime Minister Visits U.S.", "body_text": " **********Less than two weeks before Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's planned visit to Washington, the Turkish Government seems to be moving toward freeing the country's most prominent prisoner, but she says she will not accept a pardon. **********The prisoner, Leyla Zana, 36, was a member of Parliament in 1994 when she was convicted of supporting Kurdish terrorism and sentenced to a 15-year jail term. Since then her case has often been cited by critics of Turkey's human-rights record. **********According to reports published in several Turkish newspapers, Prime Minister Yilmaz would like to see Ms. Zana freed before he arrives in the United States on Dec. 17 to meet with President Clinton. **********But this week, Ms. Zana wrote letters to Mr. Yilmaz and Mr. Clinton saying she is determined to stay in jail until laws that ban separatist speech are repealed. ''Being in prison is an inevitable, unavoidable and necessary price to be paid for peace, brotherhood and a democratic Turkey,'' she wrote to President Clinton. **********In her letter to Mr. Yilmaz, Ms. Zana reminded him that he had voted for the bill lifting her parliamentary immunity in 1994 so she could be prosecuted. She urged him ''to solve the Kurdish problem with dialogue and create a democratic Turkey that is at peace with its own people.'' **********The Government is reportedly seeking to arrange Ms. Zana's release by temporarily suspending her sentence for health reasons. The same formula was recently used to free a blind lawyer, Esber Yagmurdereli, whose cause was supported by several European governments. Like Ms. Zana, Mr. Yagmurdereli had said he did not want to be freed until the laws under which he was imprisoned were repealed. **********The warden of the Ankara prison in which Ms. Zana is being held has said her health problems are not serious enough to require her release. But Minister of Justice Oltan Sungurlu has said he will submit her case to a board that considers medical discharges from prison. **********''Postponing a sentence for health reasons does not depend on an application from the person concerned,'' Mr. Sungurlu said. **********In her letters to Prime Minister Yilmaz and President Clinton, Ms. Zana said she suffered from ''no illness that would justify or necessitate a release from prison.'' She has reportedly been treated for digestive problems and a bone ailment. **********Ms. Zana is widely known in Europe as a symbol of Kurdish nationalists who are working for an autonomous or independent state in southeastern Turkey. Dozens of private groups and many officials have supported her cause, and they have been so effective that in several countries she is one of the best-known living citizens of Turkey. Partly through their efforts, she has won a series of prizes and has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. **********But many Turkish officials say that support for Ms. Zana is based on misguided idealism and ignorance of what they call her militant commitment to separatism and clandestine support for terror. They say her political party, which is now banned, was a front for separatist guerrillas. **********This week in Washington, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem asserted that critics of Turkey were using a double standard in criticizing human-rights policies here. ''Spain just sentenced 26 politicians for their links to E.T.A.,'' Mr. Cem said, referring to the Basque guerrilla group.

The French left's victory, it is said, was a heartfelt cry for an alternative to the remorseless spread of economic liberalization and its damaging social consequences for advanced industrial countries. **********As an explanation of voting behavior, the theory is clearly defective. President Jacques Chirac and the outgoing government were deeply unpopular for many reasons \u2014 including arrogance, incompetence, appalling political judgment and broken promises \u2014 that had nothing to do with the global economy. **********Many voters in the world's fourth-largest trading power, including the skilled, the well-educated and the growing numbers involved in international commerce, stand to gain from globalization. As in other industrial countries, it is the unskilled and the less educated who are more likely to suffer and most inclined to attribute their ills to the global economy. **********But that does not mean that globalization itself is their enemy. France's horrifying unemployment \u2014 a main reason for the center-right's demise \u2014 is not the fault of globalization but of France's failure to adapt to it. **********The difficulty is that while many economists know this, it is not necessarily obvious to everyone else. On the contrary, to many people in industrial countries, it seems to stand to reason that if vast numbers of low-wage workers in developing countries enter the labor force in a world without economic barriers, jobs and incomes in the richer countries must be under threat. **********Numerous economic studies now show that this is a false picture of how the world works. Counterintuitive though it may be, much recent research suggests that low-wage imports are not generally the main threat to jobs in Europe, nor are they the principal cause of growing wage inequality in the United States. **********Cheap imports of labor-intensive products are not depressing prices of competing goods made in industrial nations \u2014 and they represent only a small proportion of the rich countries' overall economic output. **********Few economists would deny that cheap imports can cause shocks in some industrial sectors. But experience overwhelmingly shows that countries and companies benefit from increased competition. **********Despite a decline in manufacturing employment, most industrial countries are still net exporters of manufactured goods to developing countries. Relatively fewer people are employed in manufacturing because productivity has risen so much that fewer workers are needed. **********The consequent shift of jobs in industrial countries from manufacturing to services is as natural and as desirable as the move from agriculture to industry over the past century. Companies investing abroad are not, in most cases, stripping their home economies of jobs. **********The main threat to jobs and wages in the industrial countries is technological progress, as computers do more jobs that people once did. One day, relatively unskilled workers will be able to operate the new technology, but not for some years yet. **********The problem with these points, of course, is that they are economic, not political. They are coldly rational, when hostility to globalization is often emotional, moral or psychological. They are not good enough answers to many people's concerns. **********It is no good telling a fired Renault worker in Belgium that deindustrialization is on the whole a good thing. The political reaction to globalization is dictated by what people think and feel, not by what economists say \u2014 even if the economists are right. **********The challenges of globalization need political as well as economic responses.

Why not the perennial leader in football video games, the Electronic Arts game bearing the likeness of John Madden, the popular sportscaster and former coach? Two words: Marv Albert. **********Mr. Albert, the former television sports announcer, does the play-by-play for the Acclaim game. Jae Min said he was unconcerned by Mr. Albert's guilty plea in September to an assault charge in connection with a sexual encounter. **********''Whatever may have happened with the trial, he's still a great sportscaster,'' he said. **********That attitude is exactly what Acclaim is banking on in the next few weeks of holiday shopping. **********The game is important to Acclaim because of financial troubles stemming from its failure to react quickly enough to the new generation of game consoles. But with new games like Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Quarterback Club, Acclaim's fortunes are expected to improve. ''Acclaim should be profitable this quarter, but the question is, can the growth be sustainable?'' said Michael P. Wallace, an analyst at UBS Securities in New York. **********Lawrence Marcus, an analyst at BT Alex. Brown Inc. in San Francisco, said Quarterback Club ''is outselling the Madden title, and that has surprised a lot of people. So many people had written Acclaim off.'' **********Mr. Marcus estimates that at least 600,000 Quarterback Club games will be sold this year, which, at close to $60 retail and $45 wholesale a game, could mean more than $25 million for Acclaim. Over all, according to research by IDC/Link, the Nintendo 64 platform represents an estimated $2 billion in revenue for 1997, out of a total console market of $5.5 billion. **********''The hype around Mr. Albert certainly does not hurt,'' said Mr. Marcus, but he said that what drives the market is ''graphics, quality of play and licensing from important brands.'' There is no doubt that Acclaim has a key license for Nintendo 64: the National Football League signed an exclusive one-year deal with the company, allowing its game to use official team logos and colors. **********Nancy Smith, executive vice president of North American sales and distribution for Electronic Arts, said it is too early to declare either the Madden game or Quarterback Club a winner, but acknowledged that the company expects to ''minimally split the segment with our competition.'' Still, according to Mr. Marcus, the Nintendo 64 football games represent less than 5 percent of sales and 3 percent of profits for Electronic Arts, compared with one-third of both for Acclaim for this quarter. **********''In the coming year, Quarterback Club will remain an important part of our portfolio, but we hope it will be just one of several new hits,'' said Greg Fischbach, Acclaim's co-chairman and chief executive. **********There has been little concern expressed by consumers about Mr. Albert's association with the Acclaim game. A buyer of video games for a major retailer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that his company had not received ''even one customer complaint.'' **********Others do object. ''It sends the wrong signal to women in abusive relationships and to children,'' said Beverly Harris Elliott, executive director of the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault in Enola, Pa. **********Acclaim said that Mr. Albert, who resigned from the Madison Square Garden network and was dismissed by NBC after the guilty plea, was signed three years ago to a multi-product deal. The first game to come out was NBA Jam Extreme in 1996; Quarterback Club was the second. ''We could have dropped him in May when the indictment first came out, but we believed him,'' said Bob Picunko, marketing director for Acclaim Sports, a division of Acclaim Entertainment. **********The charges against Mr. Albert became public May 20; Acclaim had announced his participation in February and had already recorded his voice. The game was in production before the trial began; changing the voice would have cost millions of dollars because of production delays. **********While the decision to stand pat seems to be paying off, Acclaim is learning that getting people to buy the game and getting them to like it are different matters.

They were also weird. The integers etched into the ruler-shaped sticks were almost fluidly spaced: distances varied eerily, stretching in one place, contracting in another. Despite its rigidity and meticulous demarcations, the slide rule created a sense of rubbery numerical space, revealing the magic latent in calculation. **********That was lost in the button-dominated universe of the calculator. But in recent years, the sensuous feel of mathematical manipulation has again become evident in an extraordinary piece of computer software: Mathematica. Since its development in 1988 by the mathematician and physicist Stephen Wolfram, it has become the kind of application that software entrepreneurs dream of. Lotus 1-2-3, with its pioneering spreadsheets, once made the business world pant for the PC; now, Mathematica has done something similar for every field that involves sophisticated manipulations of symbols and formulas. **********In its latest incarnation -- Version 3.0, introduced last year for $1,295, with a student version available for $140 -- Mathematica is a programming language, a calculator, a composite of subtle mathematical algorithms, and a program that is more powerful than any application that has yet been devised for it. **********Its nearly million lines of code turn the exotic into the elementary: It can solve quadratic equations, plot three-dimensional graphs, solve differential equations, find the billionth prime number and generate sounds that correspond to mathematical expressions of wave forms. Even to a user who has just begun to toy with its most accessible surface powers, it is uncanny. This program is a cyber-slide rule of sorts, which invites play and inventiveness, creates a kind of tactile feel for mathematical operations and encourages the most elaborate forms of experimentation. **********And, for the million users they say they have, that is what has happened. Wolfram Research has itself created add-on software used for trading analysis, financial modeling, mechanical engineering, fuzzy logic and calculus education. Wolfram's site on the World Wide Web includes a  chronicle of unexpected applications by others as well (www.wolfram.com/discovery). **********Mathematica has been used to study reproductive rates of sea lions in western Alaska and to develop a new model for derivatives trading by a securities company. Mathematica has been used to create animations of complex origami creations and to design the 75-ton steel velodrome that was used by cyclists at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. A newsgroup devoted to the program is archived at www.wolfram.com/cgi-bin/mathgroup. One Web site also uses Mathematica to provide a somewhat esoteric calculating service (www.integral.com): It will find the value of any definite integral -- a feat even more difficult than declining German irregular verbs, and something earlier calculus students would have happily traded in their slide rules for. **********Mathematica is also just the most sophisticated example of a different kind of mathematical work that is now developing in cyberspace: experimentation. One fascinating series of programs aimed at high school students -- the Geometer's Sketchpad from Key Curriculum Press -- even turns geometry into a laboratory science. The old compass and straightedge are replaced by on-screen tools; diagrams can be stretched and turned. (The $170 program for Windows or Macintosh -- $40 for students -- can be sampled at www.keypress.com.) **********One $25 add-on package devoted to the proofs of the Pythagorean theorem explores the ordinary right triangle with elegant constructions. The very nature of Euclidean geometry seems to change with such software. Instead of appearing to be a timeless series of diagrams bearing immutable properties, geometry evolves out of experimentation and observation. **********The computer makes this possible not simply because of its powers of calculation but because of its powers of simulation, its ability to give an idea visible shape. That is one reason Web math is flourishing. An E-zine of visual mathematics is being developed (www.maa.org/news/cvm.html). Mathematical Web sites range from the recreational (www.math.ucalgary.ca/laf/colorful.html) to the argumentative, including an essay about the growing intimacy between the Web and mathematics (http://forum.swarthmore.edu/articles/epadel) by Gene Klotz, a professor in the mathematics department of Swarthmore College. At http://forum.swarthmore.edu, a site supported by the National Science Foundation, students can post questions for ''Dr. Math,'' mailing lists are made available and links of links are accumulated. **********All of this puts a different spin on the debates that are taking place now over mathematics curriculums. The calculator has, in recent years, become a standard classroom tool, supposedly to remove the onerous difficulties of division and multiplication in favor of more grand conceptions of number. **********But the risk (apparent enough to anyone who has been around elementary schoolchildren in recent years) is that the calculator becomes a crutch. Numerical concepts start to become mere abstractions ungrounded by manipulation of the things themselves. Such manipulation is tedious but the laborious work of mathematics -- the trial and error, the stubborn quest for more elegant solutions -- is crucial for the slow accretion of abstract understanding. **********Now, with advanced software like Mathematica, educational software like Geometer's Sketchpad, and many of the sites that pepper the Web, technology is redeeming itself after years of promoting the calculator. Calculation is becoming a subtle form of play. Experimentation is joining reason. It almost feels as if the slide rule has returned."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/07/business/l-quality-child-care-comes-at-a-price-480878.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-12-07", "snippet": "Letter from Paul Wesley Knopp comments on Nov 9 essays on child care and child care workers (S)", "word_count": 180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Quality Child Care Comes at a Price", "print_headline": "Quality Child Care Comes at a Price", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Re ''Spoonfuls of Sugar, but Barrels of Salt'' and ''Putting the Children First'' (Voices, Nov. 9): **********The writers observe that the level of quality and professionalism among child care workers leaves working professional mothers frustrated and worried.

And although broadcasting did well, the company said the broadcasting business also benefited from amortization costs related to the ABC purchase. **********''The network's performance was down but the TV stations did fairly well, I believe,'' said David Londoner, who follows Disney for Schroder Wertheim & Company. **********Disney also announced that it was teaming up with the Comcast Corporation to acquire control of E! Entertainment Television, a cable programming channel, for $320 million. Comcast, which already owns 10.4 percent of E! Entertainment, will increase its stake to 50.1 percent, and Disney will own the rest as the result of the purchase of Time Warner Inc.'s 58.4 percent stake. **********Unless Disney comes up with a clever tax strategy, much of the proceeds from the planned sale of its newspapers and magazines could go to the Government in capital gains taxes. **********Disney inherited Capital Cities/ ABC's cost basis for calculating those taxes, and it is relatively low because Capital Cities had owned many of the publications for years. Indeed, last year Michael Ovitz, then Disney's president, told at least one investment banker that the company did not plan to sell the publishing operations because the tax bite would be so large. **********Apparently Disney's chairman, Michael D. Eisner, assured some key managers of that commitment. **********The newspaper industry analyst John Morton said that during a meeting with analysts last year, Philip Meeks, president of the publishing group, told his audience that Mr. Eisner had reiterated the company's decision to stay in publishing. Mr. Meeks was out of the office yesterday and did not return phone calls. **********But Wall Street was hardly surprised by the sale. ''Everyone assumed that it was not their prime focus, and that they would consider divesting those assets,'' said Harold Vogel, who follows Disney for Cowen & Company. Although Mr. Eisner is known to be uncomfortable with debt, Disney's debt levels are reasonable. And analysts generally agreed that the lack of strategic fit was a key factor for the sale, adding that Disney is likely to pay off some of its debt in any case. **********Disney no longer breaks out publishing earnings separately, but Mr. Vogel said that the publishing division was likely to bring in about $200 million in operating profits in the 1997 fiscal year, which ends in September. He added that the unit's performance has clearly improved since 1986, when it reported its high for the decade of $160 million. Typically, publishing companies sell for 10 times or 12 times cash flow, which explains why investors expect the sale to generate at least $2 billion. **********Wall Street seemed pleased with both the earnings reports and news of the pending sale: Disney's stock advanced $1 yesterday, to $72.875. **********Mr. Morton, the newspaper analyst for Morton Research, said he believed that the sale of the papers alone would bring in about $1 billion. But he cautioned that a lot of potential buyers, including Gannett, the Tribune Company and A. H. Belo, are already digesting major acquisitions, although he viewed Newhouse and Hearst as potential acquirers. **********Analysts say they will be watching to see whether Disney can find a buyer for the whole package or whether it ends up having to sell the publications piecemeal. **********Disney said yesterday that its creative content business saw profits rise 10 percent, to $719 million: broadcasting profits jumped 38 percent, to $470 million, and theme parks turned in $238 million in profits, a gain of 21 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/05/business/how-business-can-preserve-the-ideals-of-affirmative-action.html": {"writer_name": "Howard Greenwald", "pub_date": "1997-01-05", "snippet": "Comment by Howard P Greenwald on how business can preserve the ideals of affirmative action in light of California Civil Rights Initiative, referendum known as Proposition 209; says California measure may signal beginning of the end of government ...", "word_count": 778, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "How Business Can Preserve The Ideals of Affirmative Action", "print_headline": "How Business Can Preserve The Ideals of Affirmative Action", "body_text": " **********A FEDERAL judge's injunction last month halted at least temporarily the tidal wave that swamped affirmative action in California on Election Day. But while the California Civil Rights Initiative, the referendum known as Proposition 209, seems headed for a long legal battle, it will probably inspire similar actions in other states. **********The California measure seeks to prohibit race-based preferences in hiring, promotion and contracting at all state agencies as well as in admissions to the state's gargantuan public higher education system. **********If the measure survives the courts, fair-minded Americans must develop alternative plans. After a quarter-century of affirmative action, members of most minority groups remain grossly underrepresented in desirable jobs and professions. **********Rather than burying the ideals embodied in affirmative action, ideas like Proposition 209 must initiate a new era for progressives, using the input and wherewithal of the private sector. **********But people concerned with justice and equality must first recognize why affirmative action has incurred the public's wrath. Higher education provides some lessons: *********** Race-based policies in admissions have collided with core American beliefs. In a country that values individual achievement, such policies seem too much like privilege. It is noteworthy that large numbers of voters from all minorities supported the California initiative. *********** Emphasis on race in the content of higher education has often followed closely behind race-based admissions, contradicting the traditional belief in knowledge of universal value. Critics of the traditional approach have argued that educational institutions at all levels should include instruction in the languages and cultures of America's many ethnic groups. These critics tend to dismiss Western literature and science as the work of ''dead white men.'' **********But ethnic Americans have traditionally looked to higher education less for affirmation of their origins than for the tools to compete, including universally recognized technical and professional skills. Of special importance for today's newcomers is command of English, the language of money and power. **********What are the alternatives? **********A highly successful collaboration between the University of Southern California, private foundations and the business community illustrates a promising concept. This collaboration has enabled U.S.C. to start an aggressive outreach program to recruit members of minorities and to prepare them to compete for favored places in the American mainstream. **********I direct a graduate-level fellowship program aimed at increasing the representation of minorities as executives in California's $200 billion health care industry. Without political fanfare, this program has steadily added highly qualified individuals to a woefully limited pool. **********It is important to understand that tuition at U.S.C., a private university, is high when compared with that of state schools. The cost often discourages even those willing to face difficult academic challenges. **********Rather than imposing quota-like admission targets, the U.S.C. program seeks out highly qualified members of minorities and helps them with finances. This differs from traditional affirmative action in two ways: it never denies admission to a nonminority applicant in order to admit a minority applicant, and it  makes no special allowances for minority applicants who fail to meet basic standards. No one can accuse the university of admitting a minority applicant solely because of affirmative action. **********Our program, moreover, concentrates on building ties among diverse people rather than highlighting their differences. Students of all backgrounds are encouraged to share their perspectives. But the program concentrates on insuring that graduates attain common professional skills and values. **********Private financing from California corporations and nationally prominent organizations, like the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, has proved crucial to our program's success. Commitments by private donors to aid minorities promise more flexibility and stability than public affirmative action programs ever have. **********THE California measure may signal the beginning of the end of government affirmative action mandates. But it can also help start a new culture of affirmative action in the private sector. **********This will require corporations, first, to make financial contributions to the professional and management education of members of minorities, either in-house or in collaboration with educational institutions. Second, it will require actively inviting minority employees onto executive career ladders. Progressive members of the business community have a historic mission: to lead in reaffirming America's commitment to opportunity and to help renew the idea that diversity in the mainstream means a better life for all."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/31/business/worldcom-net-tops-estimates-but-stock-price-fails-to-climb.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1997-10-31", "snippet": "Worldcom Inc announces third quarter earnings of $112.4 million, compared with loss of $53 million year earlier; revenue was up 31 percent, to $1.9 billion; results, which exceed Wall Street's expectations, fail to lift company's shares above pric...", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Worldcom Net Tops Estimates But Stock Price Fails to Climb", "print_headline": "Worldcom Net Tops Estimates But Stock Price Fails to Climb", "body_text": " **********Worldcom Inc., whose unsolicited bid for the MCI Communications Corporation depends in part on the value of Worldcom stock, announced quarterly results yesterday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. **********But the robust results, built on especially muscular growth in the telecommunications carrier's international and Internet operations, failed to lift the company's shares above a price it had set to help determine the value of its MCI bid. **********Some analysts and industry executives have wondered whether the deal-making savvy displayed by Bernard J.

''As a result of increasing international pressure, we have never been closer to that day.'' **********The decision today suspends for another six months the provision of the law that would allow United States citizens or corporations to sue any foreign company using confiscated American property in Cuba. Mr. Clinton first suspended that provision in July after America's trading partners threatened to retaliate. **********And Mr. Clinton indicated that he would continue to suspend the provision every six months ''so long as America's friends and allies continue their stepped-up efforts'' to advocate democratic changes in Cuba. **********Although none have joined Washington's 34-year economic embargo of Cuba, the President and his aides here pointed to several steps taken by those allies in recent months, including a vote by the European Union last month urging Mr. Castro's Government to improve its record on human rights and political freedom. **********With his decision, Mr. Clinton appeared to be trying to strike a balance between the conflicting demands of Republicans in Congress and of trading partners abroad. Judging by today's reactions, he did not succeed. **********Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who sponsored the law with Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, condemned the President's action, saying Mr. Clinton had decided ''once again to pass up a perfect opportunity to send a strong message to the Castro dictatorship and to those who prop it up financially.'' **********At the same time, officials in Canada, Mexico and Europe remain critical of the Helms-Burton law. The European Union's envoy to the United States, Hugo Paemen of Belgium, welcomed the decision to suspend the law's most onerous provision, but said that did not resolve the underlying problem with the law itself, which Europeans say attempts to impose American foreign policy on other nations. **********Canada's International Trade Minister, Arthur Eggleton, accused the United States of ''continuing to hold this sword over the heads of other countries.'' **********Mexico was cautiously upbeat. ''The Mexican Government recognizes that the decision of President Clinton marks an effort to take into account the opinion of the international community,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement reported by Reuters. **********But the ministry added, ''The Mexican Government reaffirms the need to resolve any international differences via open and respectful dialogue, not via unilateral and confrontational methods.'' **********For now, the President's decision appears to avert a trade showdown, including the possibility of tit-for-tat legal retaliation from abroad. Canada and Mexico have each passed legislation that would allow anyone punished by the American law to seek damages in their courts. **********Nor did the President's decision resolve legal challenges to the law still being pressed in the World Trade Organization and under the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. **********The Helms-Burton Act was passed by Congress last March to discourage foreign investments in Cuba and to promote democratic changes. **********In addition to allowing the lawsuits, the law requires the State Department to deny visas to the executives of foreign companies that use offices, factories or other properties once owned by Americans but seized after the Communist revolution that swept Mr. Castro to power in 1959. **********Mr. Clinton originally opposed the law, but he signed it after the outrage that erupted when Cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes piloted by Cuban-Americans off Cuba's coast last February. He later suspended the provision allowing the lawsuits after America's allies warned of retaliation and officials within the Administration began to fear a trade war. **********In the middle of an election year, the President's maneuvering led to accusations that he was putting off a decision while trying to cultivate support of Cuban-American voters in Florida and New Jersey, states with important electoral votes. **********In August the President appointed Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Undersecretary for International Trade at the Commerce Department, as a special envoy to try to find common ground with the allies on other political and economic steps to isolate Cuba. **********At a news conference today, Mr. Eizenstat said the controversy over the Helms-Burton Act had focused the attention of European and other nations on democracy in Cuba. He noted that the European Union's resolution last month for the first time linked economic relations with Cuba to improvements in Mr. Castro's policies on human rights. **********While such efforts appear to have had little effect on Mr. Castro's grip on power, Mr. Eizenstat and other officials said they have had a punitive impact by isolating Cuba politically and by discouraging foreign investors. **********Senator Helms denounced Mr. Clinton's decision as ''a terrible mistake.'' In singling out Mexico and Canada for what he called ''shameful Cuba policies,'' Senator Helms said: ''I cannot understand why, just as we are beginning to make progress, the President has decided to give up the very leverage that brought such progress about.'' **********Mr. Clinton said the Administration would continue to enforce other provisions of the Helms-Burton Act, including the one denying visas to executives of foreign companies. **********The State Department has already imposed that punishment on a Mexican telecommunications company, Grupo Domos, and a Canadian mining concern, Sherritt International.

The economic burden of closing was taking too great a toll on workers, officials said. **********\"If workers do not earn enough to buy food, what's the point of running away from the haze?\" asked Mr. Hamid, the Sarawak undersecretary. **********Although the air pollution index was still four times normal levels, that was a dramatic improvement from earlier in the week, when haze levels were more than 15 times normal. Plantations, factories and timber-based industries were allowed to resume work by the guidelines issued Friday, provided the pollution index stays below the 500-mark, a level considered hazardous. **********Quarries and industries involving earthworks were ordered to remain shut. **********In Kuching, one of the cities hardest hit by the haze blowing across the border, doctors reported that the rush to emergency rooms had slowed.

One doctor at the Normah Specialist Medical Center in Kuching said, \"It's a paradox that some people go around with a mask and then take a break to smoke a cigarette.\" He added that living in the haze was akin to being in a smoky bar. **********But Gabriel Teo, a doctor who treats patients with respiratory problems at the same hospital, said that missed the point. **********\"We are talking about subjecting the entire population to a health risk,\" he said. \"Not everyone is a smoker, but everyone has to breathe air.

In their holsters were weapons of oratory, currency and clout. **********At stake was nothing less than Malaysia's national prestige, the future of Southeast Asian economies and, by some accounts, the very shape of the global financial system. **********Even more, the standoff pitted two worlds against one another, an Asia of growing economic might and a West convinced that free-wheeling trade -- in ideas, capital and goods -- is the best recipe for development. **********The forum was the usually somber gathering of finance ministers, bankers and economists at the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. On successive evenings, Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Soros squared off, denouncing each other in vitriolic language seldom heard in such settings. **********Yet Malaysia's economy is in crisis, its currency has collapsed and blame had to be fixed. **********Lashing out at currency traders like Mr. Soros as ''morons,'' Mr. Mahathir castigated them on Saturday as ''a group of ultra-rich people.'' **********''For them wealth must come from impoverishing others,'' Mr. Mahathir said, ''from taking what others have in order to enrich themselves. Their weapon is their wealth against the poverty of others.'' **********While not mentioning Mr. Soros by name -- although in previous comments to newspapers in Malaysia, Mr. Mahathir specifically blamed Mr. Soros for orchestrating Malaysia's economic crisis -- he told the assembled bankers and economists that Mr. Soros's ilk had to be stopped. **********''I am saying that currency trading is unnecessary, unproductive and totally immoral,'' Mr. Mahathir declared. ''It should be stopped. It should be made illegal. We don't need currency trading.'' **********Then tonight, before a standing-room-only crowd, Mr. Soros fired back at the Malaysian leader. **********''Dr. Mahathir's suggestion yesterday to ban currency trading is so inappropriate that it does not deserve serious consideration,'' Mr. Soros said. **********''Interfering with the convertibility of capital at a moment like this is a recipe for disaster. Dr. Mahathir is a menace to his own country.'' **********Since July, in the churning wake of the collapse of Thailand's currency and banking system, Malaysia has foundered. Its currency, the ringgit, has plunged 20 percent against the dollar. On the heels of the tumbling ringgit, the Malaysian stock market crashed and the country's banking system began to creak. Foreign investors fled. **********For Mr. Mahathir, who has seen his country's annual per-capita output soar from $350 to $5,000 in four decades, the assault on the ringgit smacked of a conspiracy wrought by international currency traders. **********For a man who has built the world's tallest buildings and Southeast Asia's largest airport and who harbors visions of a glittering new capital, a high-tech corridor intended to rival Silicon Valley and immense hydroelectric dams, the economic train wreck has been an affront, to him personally and to Asia. **********''We like to think big,'' Mr. Mahathir said. ''But we are not going to be allowed to do this, because you don't like us to have big ideas. It is not proper. It is impudent for us to try, or even to say we are going to do it. If we even say that when we have the money we will carry on with our big projects, you will make sure we won't have the money by forcing the devaluation of the currency. **********''If the countries of Europe and of North America can be almost uniformly prosperous, we don't see why we cannot be allowed to be a little prosperous.'' **********Then tonight, 24 hours after Mr. Mahathir's broadside against Mr. Soros, currency traders and the international financial system, Mr. Soros stood behind the same lectern and declared that the problem with Malaysia was not the world, but Mr. Mahathir himself. **********''He is using me as a scapegoat to cover up his own failure,'' Mr. Soros said. ''He is playing to a domestic audience, and he couldn't get away with it if he and his ideas were subject to the discipline of an independent media inside Malaysia.'' **********Later, at a news conference, Mr. Soros elaborated on his comments. ''I want to express my sympathy for poor Malaysians who were hurt'' by the collapse of the country's currency and stock market, ''but not for Dr. Mahathir, because he's responsible.'' **********The war of words reverberated through the cavernous conference halls, startling government officials and private bankers used to more measured language. **********An Indonesian Government economist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was angered by Mr. Mahathir's pronouncements. **********''It's very unfortunate that we are neighbors,'' the economist said. ''I know we shouldn't interfere in other countries' policies. But all I can say is that it was very interesting. As an economist there are things that I disagree with.

This ancient industry is struggling under modern constraints brought on by overfishing, which extends from the North Sea to the coast of Newfoundland and throughout the Pacific. **********Environmentalists have become increasingly successful at convincing governments to impose restrictions to preserve existing fish stocks. With catches shrinking, the governments have needed little prodding to levy quotas and limits on fishing. Last month, for example, European Union fisheries ministers agreed to a plan that will require EU countries to cut the size of fishing fleets and the time they spend at sea by 30 percent for the most endangered species and by 20 percent for other overfished stocks. **********\"There are still too many boats chasing too few fish,\" said Steven Hughes, an industry consultant in Seattle. \"It's open access here, so anyone can buy a boat and go fish. What we've done is to set a quota on what can be taken.\" **********Many fishing businesses are family-owned, he said, but far more have gone out of business, or merged with other companies to pool their quotas and gain economies of scale. **********Similar trends are evident elsewhere in the Pacific, where quotas also are imposed and many small companies are privately owned or have been bought by huge food conglomerates. **********\"There is only one listed company of reasonable size here, and it's suffering internationally from the strong New Zealand dollar and lower fish prices,\" said Warren Doak, who follows the industry for Merrill Lynch & Co. in Auckland, New Zealand. **********A few fishing companies in Thailand are publicly held, but an international brokerage with offices in Bangkok said that it no longer followed them because they were small. **********\"We have enough trouble finding liquidity in the larger companies right now,\" an analyst said, referring to the slide in Thailand's stock market. **********Still, for fans of contrarian plays, there are a few fishing-related companies that look appealing to analysts. **********Christine Farkas, who follows special situations for Midland Walwyn Capital, a Toronto brokerage, has a buy ratingout on FPI Ltd., a company in Newfoundland that is also known as Fishery Products International and is a case study in survival. **********In the late 1980s, FPI's fleet of more than 50 deep-sea trawlers brought in catches as big as 66,000 tons of cod a year. Today, since the Canadian government's 1992 moratorium on cod fishing on Newfoundland's Grand Banks, only 11 trawlers remain. Last year's catch was just 8,600 tons. The company has switched to the value-added processing of fish and shellfish, much of it purchased from as far away as Russia and China and ranging from shrimp and crab for luxury restaurants to fish for sandwiches at McDonald's. **********\"What drives their profits now is the margin between what they pay for raw fish and what they can get for selling it as a 'value-added' product,\" Ms. Farkas said. **********That spelled trouble for FPI in 1995, when high inventories and declining value-added fish prices resulted in a loss for the year. The company's shares, which had traded as high as 9.00 Canadian dollars ($6.60) slumped to a low of 4.60 dollars last summer. **********Things began to look brighter, however, as inventories decreased and the company pursued its value-added business. It returned to profitability last year, beating expectations with earnings of 37 cents a share. Ms. Farkas is projecting 50 cents a share for this year. **********Although she is estimating sales of 671 million dollars for 1997, compared with 665 million last year, \"the key is the improved margins,\" she said. FPI's stock, which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, has recovered to 6.20 dollars, and Ms. Farkas has an 8-dollar target price over the next 12 months. **********A newly listed company shows where many say the fishing industry is heading. Last week, Norway Seafoods ASA debuted on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Despite its name, it operates from Russia to Argentina and off the West Coast of the United States, where it owns the Seattle-based American Seafoods Co. The company has been on an acquisition spree, buying smaller fishing concerns as well as Frionor, a brand of fish products in Europe that it plans to promote in the United States, said Andreas Tieleman, an analyst with Enskilda Securities in Oslo. **********The company, which was founded in the 1980s, has giant trawlers that catch and then process fish. It also has built the world's largest trawler, although as one Oslo-based analyst commented, \"big isn't always an advantage.\" **********Although the company, which is aiming for $1 billion in annual sales, will clearly have a group of analysts following its stock, none of them are likely to recommend the shares before it absorbs its acquisitions. **********If the idea of investing in a company that catches and processes fish is unappealing, consider Genki Sushi Co., a Japanese chain of 120 sushi bars and restaurants. Genki is one of Japan's most popular and well-run fast-food concerns, but its sales plunged last summer after an outbreak of food poisoning in Japan, even though the source of the illness was not pinpointed. Sales continued to fall throughout the fall and winter months, and Genki's stock followed suit, bottoming at 1,162 yen ($10.20) in February, down from a peak of 2,381 yen. **********Matters were not helped by a rise in tuna prices, one of the most popular items on Genki's menu, and the generally poor performance of Tokyo's over-the-counter exchange, where the company is listed, said Mark Buffet, who follows the stock for BZW Securities. But his buy recommendation in November \u2014 reiterated last week \u2014 proved prescient when customers began to return in February. Since then, sales have rebounded, up a healthy 10 percent for the month of April. **********\"It's still a very well managed company, and if there are no more problems like last summer, its earnings for this year should be up 20 percent over last year,\" Mr. Buffet said. **********Genki will add 20 sushi bars this year, he said. The stock has recovered to 1,700 yen, but Mr. Buffet thinks it is still undervalued. He is projecting a price of 3,000 yen over the next eight months."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/02/business/economic-calendar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Calendar", "print_headline": "Economic Calendar", "body_text": " **********Expected dates for the release of major economic indicators this week. **********MONDAY **********Personal Income April **********Construction Spending April **********TUESDAY **********Leading Indicators April **********WEDNESDAY **********Factory Orders April **********New-Car Sales May **********THURSDAY **********Sales of Leading Retailers May **********Weekly Jobless Claims **********FRIDAY **********Employment May **********Consumer Borrowing April"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/06/business/fcc-to-defer-decisions-on-phone-deals.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1997-10-06", "snippet": "Federal Communications Commission chairman, Reed E Hundt, informs Senate Commerce Committee chairman, John McCain, that FCC will defer preliminary ruling on Worldcom Inc's bid for MCI Communications Corp and ruling on AT&T Corp's challenge to Bell...", "word_count": 699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F.C.C. to Defer Decisions on Phone Deals", "print_headline": "F.C.C. to Defer Decisions on Phone Deals", "body_text": " **********The Federal Communications Commission chairman, Reed E.

''Why?'' **********The budget bill recently passed by Congress directs the F.C.C. to auction radio licenses whose ownership is disputed. Mr. McCain and Mr. Hundt support that plan. The Lees do not. ''After we fought and won repeatedly under one set of rules, McCain decides to change the shape of the playing field and now he has called for having the radio station auctioned off to the highest bidder,'' Brian Lee said. **********People on Capitol Hill, who insisted on anonymity, said that Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana and a member of the Commerce Committee, had passed on to Mr. Kennard questions from Mr. Helms inquiring about Mr. Kennard's role in the Lee dispute. **********''What Senator McCain is hoping is that when Mr. Kennard answers Senator Helms's questions and gives Senator Helms the information that he wants, Senator Helms will let the nomination move forward expeditiously,'' said Mark Buse, the Commerce Committee's policy director. **********The committee intends to consider Mr. Kennard's nomination this Wednesday and the full Senate could vote on it as early as Wednesday. **********Mr. Hundt's act of deference appears a bit unusual -- he has not been shy in the past.

''What we have patented is the composition of matter on the mutation of the gene that predisposes individuals to melanoma,'' said Peter Meldrum, president of Myriad in Salt Lake City. **********Cancer is caused by the unchecked division of cells. Cell division is usually controlled by genes known as suppressors. When the body wants limited cell division, it switches off those genes. If a suppressor gene is damaged, it malfunctions; the body cannot turn it back on, cell division can run amok and tumors may result. Damage to the suppressor gene can be environmental or hereditary. **********Myriad's patent is for inherent mutations to a gene called the Multiple Tumor Suppressor 1 (MTS1). The mutated gene can be passed from parent to child. **********''The gene is a homozygous deletion, meaning it is deleted on both chromosomes,'' Mr. Meldrum said, adding that the gene is a factor in 46 percent of most major cancers. **********''But it is one of a series of genes in a cascade that leads to those cancers,'' he said. ''With melanoma, it initiates that cascade of events. If a person inherits one defective copy from one parent, it puts them at a much greater risk of melanoma.'' **********Mr. Meldrum said the threat of melanoma is about 1 percent. ''But if you have a damaged copy of the gene, you have a 25 percent risk of getting melanoma by age 50 and a 53 percent chance of getting melanoma by age 80,'' he said. **********About 40,000 Americans develop melanoma each year. Mr. Meldrum said his company will have an MTS1 detection test ready for public use in late 1998. Myriad already produces a test for the BRC-1 breast cancer gene, called BRACAnalysis. It is working on another test kit to isolate the gene that can cause salt-dependent hypertension. **********A University of Utah geneticist, Lisa Cannon-Albright, and two Myriad employees, Mark Skolnick, also a geneticist, and Alexander Kamb, a molecular biologist, are the inventors listed for patent 5,624,819. **********Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/29/business/the-euro-creates-european-turmoil.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1997-05-29", "snippet": "Dream of common currency in Europe is giving way to inescapable practical imperatives and forcing political leaders to address contradictions they have ignored for years; in France, center-right Government of Pres Jacques Chirac is fighting for su...", "word_count": 997, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Euro Creates European Turmoil", "print_headline": "The Euro Creates European Turmoil", "body_text": " **********France and Germany could hardly be more different, but it is no coincidence that both countries are going through their own convulsions in the same week. **********In France, the center-right Government of President Jacques Chirac is fighting for survival after voters issued a stunning rebuke in last Sunday's first round of national elections. **********In Germany, the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl plans to take the extraordinary step of using an obvious accounting gimmick -- booking a quick profit by revaluing gold reserves -- to reduce a ballooning deficit. **********Behind both events is one thing: the euro, the single European currency that is scheduled to be introduce in 1999. After years of talk, the dream of a common currency is now giving way to inescapable practical imperatives and forcing political leaders to address contradictions they have ignored for years. **********Until now, Mr. Chirac and Mr. Kohl have told their countries that the euro will provide something for everybody. The euro, they said, would be as solid as the German mark, vanquishing inflation and instability across Europe. But it would also unleash unprecedented new growth by eliminating the barriers created by the Continent's current patchwork of currencies. **********Now voters in both countries are learning the other side of the story.  Because countries can participate in the euro only if they meet strict fiscal and economic benchmarks this year, French leaders have put their economy through a wringer that has crushed inflation but sent the jobless rate to 12.8 percent. **********''The French are suffering from fiscal fatigue,'' remarked Kermit L. Schoenholtz, Salomon Brothers' chief global economist in London. So when Mr. Chirac asked voters for a renewed mandate for the euro, which meant more budget cuts, he added, it was hardly surprising that they said ''no.'' **********In Germany, Europe's longtime fortress of fiscal rectitude, Chancellor Kohl has become trapped between the competing goals of reuniting Germany and uniting Europe itself. **********Rebuilding the former East Germany has proved so expensive that Mr. Kohl is now resorting to bookkeeping maneuvers to plug the Government's budget deficit that is too large by the rules for monetary union. **********Today, Germany's central bank, in a rare public clash with the Government, objected to the plan to revalue gold reserves at current market prices instead of at their original cost, and to transfer about $7 billion in profit to the Treasury this year. **********''It is basically printing money,'' said Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist for UBS Securities in Frankfurt.  ''This is money that was not there prior to the revaluation.'' **********Both events have raised new doubts about whether the euro will actually arrive on time or, if it does, whether it will be as credible a currency as advertised. Most financial and political experts still believe the answer to the first question is ''yes,'' but they warn the answer to the second question is ''no.'' **********Indeed, many analysts argue that the events this week increase the probability that the European Monetary Union will include a large number of countries. When German officials resorted to precisely the kind of financial maneuvering they have sneered at in other countries, analysts say they opened the door to bending the rules for others, like Italy, that could not meet the requirements of the Maastricht treaty. **********Lionel Jospin, the French Socialist leader who is challenging Mr. Chirac's coalition, has repeatedly said he supports the euro but does not want the criteria to introduce it to block important social programs for France. Mr. Chirac himself has repeatedly locked horns with the German Government on similar issues, insisting that political leaders be given some kind of authority over decisions by the new European Central Bank that will control monetary policy and short-term interest rates. **********The looming conflicts have been apparent for a while, but the schedule for the euro has made them impossible to duck. Under the Maastricht treaty proposing a single currency, countries will be allowed to participate in the new monetary union if they meet certain strict fiscal and economic benchmarks in 1997. **********The rules require, among other things, that a country's budget deficit in 1997 must be less than 3 percent of gross domestic product, that the inflation rate remain low and that overall government debt be less than 60 percent of gross domestic product. **********Under Mr. Chirac, France's budget deficit has shrunk sharply and is now close to the target. Because France has linked its monetary policy to Germany's, its inflation has been less than 3 percent for several years. But Mr. Chirac still needed to make a few more cuts and he was determined to proceed with his broader program of liberalizing the economy. **********By calling a snap election one year ahead of schedule and framing the vote as a referendum on the euro, he gambled on being able to stretch out his tenure by an extra year and rejuvenate his mandate with, as he said, a new ''elan.'' **********Instead, his center-right coalition won with barely 30 percent of the vote, versus 37 percent for France's left-wing parties. The real outcome will not be decided until the runoff election this Sunday, but the results so far have already shaken Mr. Chirac's control of the agenda even if his coalition retains a majority in the Parliament. **********Most analysts believe that the euro will still become reality, even if the Socialists take power. But it is also clear that regardless of who wins the French will push harder than before for ''flexibility'' of the sort that the Germans instinctively loathe. **********Philippe Seguin, speaker of the French National Assembly and one of the top candidates to become the new prime minister if Mr. Chirac retains his majority, said this week that the strict requirements of the Maastricht treaty should be relaxed. **********''I dare hope that once the euro is launched and we no longer need to convince German public opinion, we will loosen it,'' Mr. Seguin said in an interview with the magazine L'Express. ''A target of 3 percent of deficits in a period of expansion is not virtuous. In a period of austerity it is masochism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/09/business/tracking-the-footprints-on-a-digital-trail.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-06-09", "snippet": "Chart describing how individuals leave electronic footprints everywhere they go and with everything they do; notes digital connections and surveillance cameras have become prime source of information for law enforcement agencies; says investigatio...", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tracking the Footprints on a Digital Trail", "print_headline": "Tracking the Footprints on a Digital Trail", "body_text": " **********On any given day, an individual leaves electronic footprints as clear as the impressions his ancestors' feet left in the forest loam.

Because something is wrong with our way of life.'' **********Many writers expressed outrage over the decision to proceed with the ceremony. The indignation was fanned by politicians, including Mr. Netanyahu and President Ezer Weizman, who tried to distance themselves from the decision. **********Mr. Netanyahu said he did not know that anyone had died, and asserted that he had issued orders that if there was a fatality, the ceremony should be stopped. Mr. Weizman initially denied reports that he had taken part in the decision to continue, then acknowledged that he had. **********Much of the debate focused on reports that the army had proposed to build the temporary bridge, but was refused because of cost, and that the police had repeatedly warned that the bridge was unsteady. To many Israelis, this appeared to reflect a pervasive shoddiness. **********''The oppressive feeling that we don't have good luck, that God is not with us, that everyone is against us, is an escape from responsibility and a disregard of reality,'' Yosef Lapid wrote in Maariv. ''Things don't go well because we do things here hurriedly and in half-haste; this one chooses the cheapest offer without checking if it is the safest one; that one employs a contractor who is willing to risk human life in order to save materials; this one signs that the bridge is usable without checking it out -- all with 'friendly negligence.' '' **********A sociologist at Tel Aviv University, Ephraim Yauchtman-Yaar, concurred in an interview with The Jerusalem Post that the Ramat Gan accident reflected a deeper problem of the society. **********''A culture has evolved where laws, rules and regulations are not respected,'' he said. This attitude, he said, had several sources -- one was in the centuries of Jewish existence in the diaspora, where rules were perceived as a tool of the enemy. Another was the informality of Jewish life, in which contacts were as important as rules in achieving an end. Finally, Mr. Yauchtman-Yaar said, ''people try to save money, and think only of the short term.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/21/business/dow-drops-for-third-day-but-technology-stocks-rally.html": {"writer_name": "David Barboza", "pub_date": "1997-03-21", "snippet": "Dow Jones industrial average loses 57.40 points to close at 6,820.28, falling for third straight day and dropping to its lowest level in six weeks (M)", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Drops for Third Day, but Technology Stocks Rally", "print_headline": "Dow Drops for Third Day, but Technology Stocks Rally", "body_text": " **********Continuing fears over higher interest rates rattled the stock market yesterday, even as technology stocks rallied for the first time in more than a week. **********The Dow Jones industrial average lost 57.40 points, to close at 6,820.28, falling for the third straight day, and dropping to its lowest level in six weeks.

But Florencia Lopez, a seamstress, said that the general was ''a strongman who had robbed the public till.'' **********General Rodriguez became one of the richest men in Paraguay under the military government that he toppled. After a 40-year military career with a top salary of $500 a month, he owned the nation's largest brewery, a chain of currency exchange shops, an import-export business, several ranches, and a copper wire company. **********Toward the end of General Rodriguez's career, there were persistent allegations that he was involved in cocaine trafficking from neighboring Bolivia to Europe and the United States, but such charges were never proved. **********After his retirement from the army, General Rodriguez was sworn in as a Paraguayan Senator for Life, a position that granted him immunity from attacks by political enemies, many of them former Stroessner aides angry at losing their privileges. **********Last year, General Rodriguez played a major role in ending a tense constitutional standoff between President Wasmosy and a renegade army general, Cesar Oviedo, who refused to yield power. **********General Rodriguez is survived by his wife, Nelly Reich de Rodriguez and three daughters, Dolly, Mirtha, and Martha, who reside in Paraguay."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/24/business/concession-with-little-immediate-effect.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1997-07-24", "snippet": "Analysis of Boeing Co's concession to European Union officials--giving up exclusive 20-year contracts to supply aircraft to American, Delta and Continental airlines in return for approval of Boeing's acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp; says ind...", "word_count": 564, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Concession With Little Immediate Effect", "print_headline": "Concession With Little Immediate Effect", "body_text": " **********The Boeing Company's concession to European Union officials -- giving up exclusive 20-year contracts to supply aircraft to American, Delta and Continental airlines in return for approval of the acquisition of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation -- will have little practical effect for years to come, industry experts said yesterday. **********After all, the airlines, having placed orders for the next 20 years, still want the aircraft they have ordered for the foreseeable future. And there are powerful incentives to remain with one manufacturer, including reduced training costs for pilots and mechanics, and the lower costs associated with carrying inventories of spare parts for only one brand of aircraft. **********Boeing acceded to European demands that the exclusivity clauses be dropped so that Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that is Boeing's biggest rival, would not be frozen out of competition for new orders for so many years. However, Airbus or any other potential competitors to Boeing would have to offer strong incentives to airlines to complicate their fleets with new aircraft types. **********''That will be a powerful force in deterring the airlines from making any radical changes,'' said Edmund S. Greenslet, an industry analyst who runs ESG Aviation Services in Ponte Verde Beach, Fla. ''It's going to be a tough sell, but not an impossible sell.'' **********But, he added, ''For the next five years, even 10 years, I don't think it means anything.'' **********Beyond that time, though, the Boeing concession appears to be a slight positive for Airbus and the airlines that signed the agreements with Boeing, and a slight negative for Boeing itself. **********The airlines will continue to hold on to the steep discounts they received for new aircraft in return for wedding themselves to Boeing.

One Socialist industrialist said that \"the longer the government puts off taking a position, the better the chances that it can distance itself in practice from its own doctrine.\" **********A hint of how the government might proceed with France Telecom, whose partial privatization had been scheduled to start this month by the previous government, came Friday when a government minister told the magazine Le Nouvel Observateur that \"there would be no objection to selling some shares to the company's employees.\" **********But Claude Allegre, the minister of research and a close confidant of Mr. Jospin, denied that the government had a broader appetite for privatizations. He recalled that when a Socialist government decided to hive off France Telecom from the French post office in 1991, Mr. Jospin, a cabinet minister, publicly opposed the move. **********Mr. Allegre dismissed a suggestion that privatization in France spawned entrepreneurship, saying that \"most of the top French businessmen are bureaucrats who got control of nationalized companies that were then privatized.\" **********But most observers believe that Mr. Jospin cannot afford to wait long. **********Selling off state-owned companies would bring in revenue to ease the nation's debt load. More importantly, the companies \u2014 including France Telecom and Air France, Airbus Industrie and Thomson-CSF, the defense-electronics giant \u2014 need to go into private hands before their main international competitors will seal strategic alliances with them. **********A common feature of these four major enterprises \u2014 in the case of Airbus, Europe's biggest single industrial operation, the French partner company is state-owned Aerospatiale \u2014 is that they operate in markets fully exposed to international competition from big private companies. **********Mr. Jospin said Thursday that there might have to be \"adaptations\" for such companies \u2014 a phrase that some executives interpreted Friday to mean eventual privatization. **********That would leave untouched the status of public-service industries such as the French railways or even state-owned insurance and other financial service companies \u2014 for example, the Groupe GAN insurance company with its banking subsidiaries or Credit Lyonnais SA \u2014 on the grounds that they operate mainly in domestic markets largely shielded from the outside pressures. **********Asked to interpret the distinction made by Mr. Jospin in a policy statement, Socialist officials were reluctant to venture much farther Friday than to say that any privatizations would be considered on a case-by-case basis, an approach bound to slow the process. **********France has pledged to privatize several big companies, including Air France, Credit Lyonnais and GAN, as part of a deal with the European Commission allowing Paris to provide a final round of subsidies aimed at saving the companies from bankruptcy. But Socialist officials have made it clear that they are prepared to ignore rulings from Brussels if politics force them to. **********French public opinion remains largely hostile to privatization, in contrast to general support for the idea in most of Europe. Germany is privatizing Deutsche Telekom, and Italy's Socialist government said Friday that it expected to privatize the Italian post office.

They became accessible for the first time this week. **********But rather than ushering in a new era of candor about the past, the opening of the Office of History in the Interior Ministry, eight years after the collapse of Communism, is raising questions. **********Historians, citizens and members of the junior partner in the governing coalition are asking: Why are so few files available? What has happened to the rest? **********''The process has only begun -- we have to force it open,'' said Imre Mecs, who spent six years on death row after the 1956 Hungarian uprising was crushed by Soviet forces. Mr. Mecs, who is now the chairman of the Parliamentary Defense Committee, continued: ''I feel that the past should be opened as a cleansing process. It will hurt personal feelings, but these are things we have to swallow.'' **********Mr. Mecs, who keeps a portrait in his office of Prime Minister Imre Nagy, the hero of the failed uprising who was later hanged, is a member of the Liberal Democrats. The party has led the drive for accessibility to dossiers compiled by the Communist secret police services. **********But the dominant force in the Government, the former Communist Party, led by Prime Minister Gyula Horn, has been much more reluctant. **********By the time Communism fizzled here, the Government had become the most relaxed in the Eastern bloc, and many expected that the files of the security apparatus would be more easily pried loose than elsewhere. The expectations where heightened because for the first four years of the post-Communist period the Government here was dominated by right-of-center politicians who excoriated the Communists at every turn. **********But Hungary became one of the laggards. The first Government decided to hold the files as a weapon to selectively discredit and blackmail opponents and now, Mr. Mecs said, the former Communists are nervous about how the contents of the files would reflect on them. **********By contrast, East Germany opened its state security archives almost immediately after the fall of the Berlin wall, a move that some human rights activists asserted led to indiscriminate finger-pointing. **********Before Czechoslovakia split into two countries, a swath of security files that named names were released there. Those described as secret police collaborators, though not always accurately, were denied public office. In June Czech citizens were allowed for the first time to request their personal security files. **********There are a number of reasons why the documents in the Interior Ministry's cellar are far less complete than they would like, ministry officials said. The ministry is now run by Gabor Kuncze, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. **********First, when it became clear in 1989 that Hungarian Communism was ending, the shredding machines at the secret police agencies worked overtime. ''There was a tremendous panic,'' Mr. Mecs said. His own files -- no doubt copious, he said -- are among those declared missing. **********Then, many papers that were not destroyed at the domestic intelligence agency were moved to other parts of the security apparatus, including the anti-espionage division and foreign intelligence. **********These divisions are still run by bureaucrats from the old guard, who according to a 1994 law control which documents can be released to the History Office. Anything that the intelligence agencies deem ''operational'' -- which seems to include much of the post-1956 spying -- can be kept secret by these bureaucrats, Mr. Mecs said. **********To diminish the control of intelligence officials, Mr. Mecs said he favors setting up an independent committee that would have decision-making powers over releasing pre-1989 files. Since the spy agencies were working for the Communist Party rather than the national interests, he asserted, 99 percent of the documents cannot be regarded as confidential. **********During its first week, interest in the History Office was low-key. Gyorgy Marko, the director of the office, said 63 people came in to make applications to see their files; 40 others wrote letters of request. **********Paul Lendvai, who fled Hungary in early 1957 and went on to become a well-known journalist covering Communist Eastern Europe from his base in Austria, said that after 1956, ''everybody in Hungary was more or less co-opted, even those who were sentenced to long sentences.'' A widespread fear of embarrassment accounted for the lack of enthusiasm to uncover the past, he said. **********When Mr. Lendvai tried to use his clout -- including a face-to-face appeal to Prime Minister Horn -- to get access to his files that he knew had existed, he came up empty-handed. **********In his recent autobiography, ''Blacklisted,'' Mr. Lendvai refers to his secret police files from East Germany and the Czech Republic. In them, the Hungarian security bosses were quoted as bragging about their extensive knowledge of Mr. Lendvai -- described as a ''most dangerous man.'' **********When he was honored in the Hungarian Parliament last year, Mr. Lendvai scolded the Government for allowing the security archives to be run by people who had been in charge of ''dusty lies.'' **********''I'd rather get my files than the award,'' he said.

Carefully, with chopsticks and a ladle, he filled five small bowls with noodles before setting them in front of each of the diners, regular customers. **********''Ahh, mh-goi sai'' -- ''thank you very much,'' the customers murmured. **********But Mr. Pang, the sleeves of his white jacket turned up twice over his thin arms, was already moving away from the table, a brusqueness for which the Luk Yu Teahouse is famous. **********For nearly 60 years the Luk Yu has been an institution in Hong Kong, more club than restaurant, a club of regular diners, and grumpy waiters for those who aren't. **********As the lunch hour petered out and the last diners scuttled back to their offices, Mr. Pang, 47, sagged into a chair in the back of the restaurant and poured himself a cup of tea. **********''I leave home at 5:30,'' he said, ''and I get here about 6:35 and work until 2:30 in the afternoon. Then I'm off. I start again at 6 and work until 10:30. Then I go home. I only get two days off every month, so I work 28 days a month. The law is you're supposed to get four days off a month, but most restaurants only give two.'' **********The phone rang in the little back room as he talked, and Mr. Pang picked it up and listened. ''That was a customer, a regular, who wanted some special dishes for tonight,'' he explained afterward. **********''We used to be very famous for our dim sum, but some people say it's not so good anymore. A lot of the old chefs have retired, and the next generation is not as good as the last.'' Still, the Luk Yu has a reputation for serving superb food, particularly dishes that may not appear on the menu. **********''Regular customers are important,'' Mr. Pang said. ''Down here on the ground floor, I would say there are the most regulars. There are these really old customers who can't get up the stairs anymore. So of course they're all on the ground floor. They'll ask you to save them a table, and you do. During lunch time, all the tables are taken by regular customers. That guy who just called -- he's been coming for more than 20 years.'' **********From the floor of the Luk Yu, Mr. Pang has observed the seasons of life, as reflected in the shifting clientele. **********''In the beginning, you don't care for these people,'' he confessed. ''You see people become successful over the years. You see people who fail in their business and they stop coming. In the last year or so, more mainlanders have been coming in, but they come with the regulars.'' **********Although Mr. Pang was born in China, in the Pearl River delta town of Panyu, he came here as an infant when his parents fled Communism in 1950. ''They had a little shop that wove bamboo for window shades,'' he said. ''We lived in Sham Shui Po,'' one of the poorest urban neighborhoods in Hong Kong. ''I had seven brothers and sisters, but I don't remember how old they all are. I only remember how old I am.'' **********From his first job at 16, Mr. Pang has worked nearly every day of his life -- always in restaurants. He paused briefly to marry. He has two sons, one 21, the other 26. He said he has little time for his family, though all four members live together in a small two-room apartment. **********''I can't afford to live over here,'' on Hong Kong Island, he said, where housing prices can be stratospheric. ''Twenty years ago I bought a little apartment in Kwai Chung,'' a neighborhood near Hong Kong's container terminals. The 500-square-foot place cost  about $20,000. **********One week a year, Mr. Pang and his family return to Panyu to pay respects to the grave of his grandparents. There is little time off beyond that, he said, although, like many other Hong Kongers, he finds the lure of the race track nearly irresistible. **********''I used to gamble more,'' he said. ''In 1992, I won a couple of million dollars,'' nearly $300,000. ''But I kept betting more and lost half of it again. I get these tips from customers. During 1992, we had customers who know people in the stables and lots of races were fixed.'' **********Indeed, there have been repeated scandals at Hong Kong's tracks and most people take it as a matter of faith that the races are rigged. Even so, last year Hong Kongers bet $11 billion on the horses. **********''I don't bet so much anymore,'' he said. **********Over the course of several long conversations, Mr. Pang never mentioned Hong Kong's handover to China and seemed somewhat surprised when asked about it. **********''I have no feeling about it at all,'' he said firmly. ''It's like something that's inevitable. What's the big deal? I still have to work. It has nothing to do with me. I think things will change, but I don't think China will want to destroy Hong Kong.

She took a leave from her job as a health care specialist in California, and the couple traveled on cruise ships. ''That convinced me not to retire,'' Mrs. Cambron said. ''I did not want to feel useless.'' She also wanted to build her pension. And 12 years later, at 73, she still draws a paycheck -- a stalwart in the growing ranks of older women who continue to work after their husbands stop. **********Sandra Kaul, an art gallery director and consultant, is just entering those ranks. Her husband, lured by the offer of a sweetened pension, retired in June at 58, after 30 years as a college art professor in Minnesota. ''I encouraged him,'' said Ms. Kaul, who is 55. ''I knew he really wanted to stay home and paint, while I have a career to pursue.'' **********Helena Genovese, 63, stays at her job out of both necessity and desire. Her husband, a professional hypnotist, now 68, retired seven years ago, worried that if he did not ease up he might suffer a fatal heart attack, as a friend had. But his $850 in monthly retirement benefits, mostly from Social Security, is insufficient to maintain the couple's suburban life style without Ms. Genovese's $1,900-a-month salary as a manager of the parking facility at Buffalo's airport. **********''Besides, what would I do all day at home?'' she asked. ''He plays with the dog, builds model planes and visits our children. I think that if two people are home together constantly, they could end up killing each other.'' **********Having distinguished themselves as the first generation to leave the house to work in large numbers, women in their late 50's and early 60's are now in retirement range. If they are single, divorced or widowed, they often keep working, surveys show, because they lack the Social Security credits or pension savings of men their age, who earned more and worked more years. But in growing numbers, married women in this age group are also staying on the job -- breaking with the practice of sharing their husbands' retirement. **********Surveys are just beginning to catch the shift and the reasons for it. A big one is the promise of an independent pension to avoid the poverty that often comes to widows who rely on their husbands' benefits. Social Security, the main ingredient in most cases, is cut after a husband's death. **********''Older women keep working to secure their economic survival,'' said Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research in Washington. **********What is more, the extra income earned by the women helps maintain family living standards, particularly if a husband has been pushed out of the labor force before he had planned to retire. And there is what Mathew Greenwald, a market researcher who polls people on retirement issues, calls the sociability aspect. **********''Building friendships on the job is often more important to women than it is to men,'' he said. ''Women may want to go on working to maintain these friendships. They find the idea of being retired more isolating than men do.'' **********Whatever the reasons, women's persistence in working could have broad implications for the economy. It could, for example, relieve some of the financial pressure on the Social Security system, which will be stretched thin when the baby boomers retire. **********The statistical evidence is still sparse, but the shift appears to apply mainly to those 55 to 64 and not to those 65 and older. The number of working men and women in that older group has traditionally been relatively small, although it has crept up slightly for both sexes in the 1990's. **********The University of Michigan, which is tracking people in their 50's and 60's in a federally financed study that is just beginning to produce data, found that of 813 married women whose husbands had retired, 45 percent still worked, most of them full time. ''These are serious workers, not just women doing real estate,'' said Marjorie Honig, a Hunter College economist who helped tabulate the results. **********Labor Department surveys also suggest that married women are working in increasing numbers after their husbands stop, or at least that married women aged 55 to 64 are staying in the labor force in rising percentages while men are not. Nearly 3.5 million women in this group were in the labor force last year, or 48.6 percent of all married women 55 to 64, up from 41.3 percent in 1989 and 36.3 percent in 1980. But the percentage of married men in that age group in the labor force has fallen to 70.2 percent, from 75.4 percent in 1980. **********''Women are beginning to realize that by working just a few more years, they become eligible for good pensions,'' said Olivia Mitchell, a labor economist at the University of Pennsylvania. ''The benefit of those few extra years can be quite high.'' **********MS. GENOVESE, who took a salaried job in 1980 when the youngest of her four children was 13, came to exactly that conclusion. ''If I work three more years, I'll be eligible for a pension of $1,000 a month,'' she said. She made it clear that if her health held up, she would work indefinitely, qualifying for an even bigger pension. Her job also provides the couple's health insurance. **********Many other women are also working for bigger pensions. The Social Security Administration projects that if current trends continue, by 2015 nearly 60 percent of married women will be entitled to higher pensions upon retirement than the spousal benefit they would receive under their husbands' Social Security. That would be up from 33 percent today. And 20 percent of the women will qualify for pensions that are higher than those of their husbands, up from less than 10 percent today. **********But there is a caveat about projecting the trend forward. What Ms. Cambron, Ms. Kaul and Ms. Genovese share with many older married women is this: They took jobs and began careers relatively late in life after raising children or at least staying home until their children were in junior high school. Younger women, on the other hand, are far more likely to have careers that parallel those of their husbands. Once they reach retirement age, husband and wife, having gone through the same career cycles, may think alike about retirement. **********''The question is, will these younger people prod each other to stay on the job or will they prod each other to retire,'' said Angela O'Rand, a Duke University sociologist and retirement specialist. **********For now, however, older husbands and wives are increasingly going in separate directions. **********Six months after her husband retired, Ms. Kaul is in high career, having entered the work force only 14 years ago, once her two children became teen-agers. She is even expanding her domain, looking into using retail stores as small, makeshift art galleries for Minnesota painters. Actually, her work as the art gallery director at Bemidji State University, 100 miles north of Minneapolis, where her husband, Marlin, had taught for 30 years, is a part-time job. But Ms. Kaul has five part-time jobs, most of them as a paid consultant to various art councils and art projects in Minnesota. **********''I am in the process of proposing to the university a larger position for myself,'' she said. ''It will probably be three-quarters time. I am suggesting that we start a museum program, to manage art collections and curate them for traveling exhibitions.'' **********Still, the Kauls do not have to rely  on her income. Marlin Kaul's sweetened pension -- a lump-sum payment and $40,000 a year -- is enough for them to live comfortably. The $15,000 she brings home helps, of course, but her decision to keep working separates the Kauls from three couples who are their friends. The men, also professors at Bemidji, accepted sweetened pensions, too, and their wives have decided to retire with them. All three women had worked much longer than Ms. Kaul. **********''Two of them were in teaching careers,'' Ms. Kaul said, ''and they no longer like their jobs enough to keep doing them anymore now that their husbands are retiring.'' **********The decision also swings the other way. And when it does, a wife who continues to work sometimes ends up on Rosalind Barnett's couch. Ms. Barnett, a psychologist and senior researcher in women's issues at Brandeis University and Radcliffe College, recounts one patient's story: **********''Her husband, a lawyer who never liked what he did, lived for the day he could move to the woods in New Hampshire, and this was a nightmare for her,'' Ms. Barnett said. ''She was the director of a nonprofit organization, involved in work and community life, with a big network of people around her, and he wanted to retire to a rural life style.'' **********In the end, the husband did not retire. ''He cut back his hours,'' Ms. Barnett said, ''but he is still working as a lawyer. He is very unhappy.'' **********EVEN husbands who support their wives' decisions to keep working can take awhile to get there, as Dominic Genovese did. **********He had never cooked, and for five years after he retired he stayed out of the kitchen, which meant that his wife could not relax until she had prepared dinner. ''The stress for me did not end with the job,'' she said. And the dinner hour became later and later. ''That ticked me off,'' Mr. Genovese said, ''But cooking is something I did not think of doing. I made the bed; that took only a few minutes. And I vacuumed; I did not want to be home with dog's hair around.'' **********A life-threatening stomach ailment changed his attitude toward cooking, he said -- as did the fact that the couple's three adult sons cook. He now makes dinner four nights a week. **********Howard Aronoff, 57, of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., also cooks. His mother had taught him, and in retirement, he took over that task from his wife, although she still does the grocery shopping. Unlike Mr. Genovese, Mr. Aronoff did not willingly retire: he took a buyout in 1993 from I.B.M., where he was a senior planner, rather than risk being laid off without any payment. After briefly trying a new career as an insurance salesman, ''I drifted into retirement,'' Mr. Aronoff said. ''When people found out I was no longer at I.B.M., they looked on me as a piece of dead wood.'' **********Her husband's changed status scared his wife, Roberta, who is 53.  His earnings suddenly deflated from more than $80,000 a year to a $35,000  pension even as the couple, who were nearly finished paying for their two children's undergraduate education, were counting on the next five years to save for retirement. So she has continued in her nearly $30,000-a-year job as the manager of a dental office, a position she had held for a decade. **********''You have to sit down and work out the money issues,'' she said. ''My husband did that. He showed me, with spreadsheets, how we would get by, and that eased my mind. He found a way even to save a little.'' **********The new budget meant belt-tightening. They bought a new car for her, for example, but he still drives a 1988 model. And their daughter, now at Harvard Law School, pays her own way. ''My wife would have liked some new jewelry,'' he said, ''and I would have liked to help my children more.'' **********Sometimes a husband chooses retirement because changes at work  suddenly make the job much more difficult. William Cambron found himself in this situation in 1985, when he was 62. For years, he had been a salesman for a wholesale company that offered a line of toasters and household wares to hardware stores. As those stores lost out to big discounters like Sam's Club, the Wal-Mart unit, Mr. Cambron had to travel farther from the couple's home in Sacramento. **********''They kept widening his territory as the market dwindled, and he was tired,'' Ms. Cambron said. And so he stopped. ''He does not have a need to work. Basically, he enjoys supporting me in what I do. He even keeps my car filled with gas. I never have to do that anymore.'' **********When her husband retired, Ms. Cambron, a year younger, was only a decade into a career as a health care specialist in the California Department for the Aging. That job paid her $50,000 a year when she retired two years ago and shifted to a job monitoring nursing homes for a nonprofit organization, earning just $7,000 but working far fewer hours. Being older than 70, she is permitted to draw her full Social Security and a California state pension. They total $37,000, exceeding her husband's retirement payments by $7,000, even as she still draws a paycheck. **********''I would not be well off,'' she said, ''if I had not continued working.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/27/world/france-s-cowboys-yup-fight-for-their-range.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1997-03-27", "snippet": "Article on Mejanes, France, focuses on farmers' efforts to save Camargue wetlands from development; map; photo (M)", "word_count": 790, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "France's Cowboys (Yup!)

The pink flamingos, poised in a few inches of water, are curving their necks in courtship displays. Teals and shovelers fidget in their showiest plumage. **********For the Camargue's people, this is the time to renew the proposition that France has real cowboys. As the days warm, they put on their Provence costumes, mount their half-wild horses and race across the great flatlands. **********That humans and beasts can live in such unusually large open spaces along France's coveted Mediterranean coast is a result of an extraordinary but, some fear, temporary truce between farmers and developers, biologists and tour operators. Under the truce, farmers may turn their old ranch houses and stables into guesthouses and riding schools, as many are doing. But for people seeking construction of new buildings, extra roads or bridges, the answer in recent years has been no. **********Part of this river delta is parkland protected by the Government, but as much as half of the 215,000-acre park is owned by farmers who grow rice or raise cattle and the tough white breed of Camargue horses. Some old-time farmers believe that the best way to protect the wetlands is not with fences and rules but by preserving the traditions of rustic country life. **********One tradition was on display on a recent Saturday at Mejanes, a hamlet on the shore of the great Vaccares lagoon. The event was a ''ferrada,''  traditionally the branding of the cattle but in this century a friendly competition in which horsemen chase young bulls. The idea is to trip up the bull with a long, blunt stick. **********This was a cheerful, bloodless event: families from far-off farms mingled and embraced, townspeople here for the day had a taste of ruggedness and most of the young bulls got away. **********''It was all right, more or less,'' said Denys Colomb de Daunant, a horse breeder and writer who at age 74 has cut back on his own riding but was turned out for the event in the customary black felt hat and patterned Provence shirt. The young people are breaking the rules, he said, grumbling that start and finish lines were not in the right places, that some of the Camargue stallions were poorly groomed. **********Guarding the traditions is what Mr. Colomb de Daunant has done much of his life, combining the care for his herds with the writing of screenplays and books set in these windy flatlands. His passion and that of others helped create the Camargue national park in 1972. But he said that he and like-minded conservationists cannot lower their guard because pressure on this oasis has been unrelenting. **********The latest threat comes from developers promoting the building of a bridge across the Rhone. ''That would put Marseilles at our doorstep,'' Mr. Colomb de Daunant said. ''We don't want any bridge. We don't need it. Only construction companies do.'' **********For all its unspoiled beauty, this is not a place created entirely by nature. The Rhone delta was once shielded from the sea only by wandering dunes. But a century ago, levees were built to stop the Rhone's meanderings and hem the powerful river into two main branches. A seawall further stabilized the land. Pumps are now used to bring seawater into the web of brackish lagoons. In the uplands, where rice and wheat are grown, the river water is channeled into irrigation canals. **********All this manipulation, though, has wrought a rich mosaic of habitats. It has also produced one of Europe's busiest breeding and feeding grounds for birds, fish and small mammals. For thousands of songbirds, waders and ducks this is a vital stopover to and from their wintering grounds in Africa. **********One of the main Mediterranean nesting sites for the spectacular pink flamingo is a secluded man-made island in a salt marsh where water levels are kept constant and chicks are safe from land-based predators. **********Biologists worry about the pollution of the Rhone and the runoff from farm fertilizers. But at last count, there were 22,000 breeding pairs of flamingos, a record number, said Pierre Andre, a park warden who was out the other day making an inventory of the local wildlife. **********On a blue alarm clock that Mr. Andre keeps in the front of his beat-up car it was 12 o'clock. ''Lunchtime,'' he said, ''I always respect that.'' **********By a hillock punctured with fox and rabbit holes, he unpacked two baguettes, a salami, a large pate and larded pork. He laid all of this out amid the rabbit droppings. **********''We may be in the wilds,'' Mr. Andre said, snapping open a big knife. ''But we must eat. We are still in France.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/21/business/two-exchanges-post-rises-in-uncovered-short-sales.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-11-21", "snippet": "New York Stock Exchange reports that open positions of short sales rose 3.9 percent, or 133.3 million shares, to record 3.55 billion shares in month ended Nov 10; American Stock Exchange says short interest rose 6 percent, to 192 million shares, a...", "word_count": 1778, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Exchanges Post Rises In Uncovered Short Sales", "print_headline": "Two Exchanges Post Rises In Uncovered Short Sales", "body_text": " **********In a short sale, shares are borrowed from a broker and sold in hopes that prices will fall, so that they can be bought back at lower prices for a profit.

Nikko Securities, Daiwa Securities, and Yamaichi Securities, three of the Big Four firms whose top executives have been recently arrested in connection with the widening payoff scandal, await punishment to be meted out by the Ministry of Finance, which may include orders to suspend proprietary trading. **********While the two Japanese exchanges are expected to list new issues for options trading in November (10 in Tokyo, 20 in Osaka), analysts said that it would probably not be worth the investment for brokerage houses to expand coverage of individual stock options. **********Despite the dismal state of the options market, Mr. Masuda said that single options were potentially useful for investors. He added that market turmoil, like the turbulence that jolted the world this week, may cause investors to acknowledge the virtue of using options to hedge against declines in individual stock prices. **********Another Big Bang development led the Japan Securities Dealers Association, which has government-mandated regulatory functions, to make trading in unlisted stocks legal business of securities companies in July. **********Only eight small brokerage firms have since registered with the association as dealers, however, and the association said that it does not see an immediate, booming potential for the market. **********\"At a time when the market is down,\" said Mitsuru Yoshikawa, director of legal and tax research at Daiwa Institute of Research, \" it is difficult to find people who are interested in these small-cap stocks.\" **********Investors hoping for favorable changes in Japan's institutional framework will have to wait until brokerage commissions are liberalized in 1999 or when the securities transaction tax is scrapped or considerably reduced. Commissions are currently fixed at 1.15 percent of the purchase price, for trade of less than 1 million yen ($8,330). Above that, the rates differ according to the amount of trade. **********When companies are allowed to set commissions freely, Mr. Yoshikawa added, the rate could come down considerably, not just for large-lot orders but also for relatively small investments. Contrary to the trend that followed deregulation on commissions in the United States, where individual brokers' pay is often commensurate with their sales performance, Japanese sales workers are salaried, thus it is likely that transaction fees will fall even for small-lot orders, Mr. Yoshikawa said. **********The Liberal Democratic Party, the dominant party in the coalition government, has recently unveiled an economic stimulus package in which it pledged to \"strive\" toward removing the transaction tax, which is currently at 0.21 percent of the transaction value and is levied on every Japanese trade. Observers said it was unlikely that the taxation would remain in its current form, and that abolition or significant reduction could come as early as April. **********\"It must be abolished,\" said Mr. Yoshikawa of Daiwa Institute of Research. \"It is odd that tax is imposed on the transactions regardless of whether you made money or not.\" **********\u2014"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/16/business/arnell-group-gets-3-new-assignments.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-06-16", "snippet": "Arnell Group wins three new assignments; will handle brand duties for Limited Inc's Henri Bendel retail chain; will create trade advertising drive for Elle magazine; will develop worldwide brand identity program for Guggenheim Museum and its retai...", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arnell Group Gets 3 New Assignments", "print_headline": "Arnell Group Gets 3 New Assignments", "body_text": " **********Arnell Group in New York has received three assignments with billings estimated at $10 million. **********For Henri Bendel, the retail chain owned by Limited Inc. in Columbus, Ohio, Arnell was named to handle brand duties that will include redesigning store identity, signs and packaging and creating advertising and direct mail.

But officials on both sides conceded that no matter what they put on paper over the next few days, it may not break the power of organized crime groups that are widely viewed as controlling Japan's ports. **********But to both the Americans and the Japanese, that seemed almost secondary to the daylong scramble to patch together an accord that would persuade the Federal Maritime Commission to back away from its unexpected decision on Thursday to close American ports to Japanese cargo ships. **********By early evening -- after meetings at the White House that involved the Treasury Secretary, the trade representative and the chief of staff, Erskine Bowles -- the commission decided not to order the Coast Guard to begin the embargo, which would have been the first since 1941, when oil shipments were halted. Japanese schoolchildren are still taught that the 1941 embargo precipitated the attack on Pearl Harbor. **********The commission planned the embargo after Japanese shipping companies, on orders from their Government, refused to pay $4 million in fines imposed six weeks ago in an effort to force the relaxation of port rules. Whether they will still have to pay is among the unresolved issues. **********In fact, the Administration could not seem to decide today whether this was a brewing crisis or a comic series of missteps on both sides. At one point, a senior official at the White House was even reciting the lessons of the Cuban missile crisis, which gripped Washington 35 years ago this week: before plunging into a naval embargo, it was important to make sure the other side had a graceful way out. **********What happened today was that the unexpected decision by the Maritime Commission forced both Washington and Tokyo to elevate their long-running port dispute to the highest political levels. ''Let's say it concentrated the minds,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, who was thrown into the talks along with the Japanese Ambassador, Kunihiko Saito. **********Mr. Saito is no newcomer to Tokyo-Washington contretemps. His previous job was Deputy Foreign Minister, the top career diplomatic post in Japan, a position that offered plenty of opportunity to defuse trade disagreements that threatened to weaken the Japanese-American alliance. But today he was careful not to declare victory. **********''I hesitate to call it a success yet, because some details are still being worked out,'' Mr. Saito said in an interview this afternoon. ''There is a limit to what the Japanese Government can do, because there are private parties involved.'' **********One of those parties -- the Japan Harbor Transportation Association -- has a stranglehold on port operations, which is the heart of the problem. For decades, its dictates on how shipping companies must operate, including requiring expensive advance clearance for every change in plans, have been the law of the waterfront. The situation is not eased by the fact that the dividing line between the association and the yakuza, Japan's organized crime groups, is murky at best. **********''There are very powerful, well organized groups on the docks,'' Mr. Eizenstat said today, weighing every word, ''with a great deal of muscle, in more ways than one.'' **********In the accord today, Japan agreed that all shipping companies will be permitted to go through the Government to deal directly with port operators. Of course, many of those operators are members of the association, but, in theory at least, foreign companies may be able to open their own terminals. **********''This new system certainly will be tested in the very near future,'' said Koji Tsuruoka, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official involved in the talks. ''It remains to be seen what happens. But we are hopeful.'' **********Mr. Tsuruoka insisted that the yakuza had been driven out of many of the ports and that its influence was diminishing. ''The question is whether the association would harass someone using the new alternative route,'' he said. Japan has ''given assurances that order will be maintained at the ports and Japanese laws will be enforced.'' **********Such assurances are something short of an ironclad commitment,  but many Japanese trade accords have been infused with the same vagueness. **********When Japan and the United States reached a landmark accord on automotive trade in 1995, they described Japan's obligations in such differing terms that it sometimes seemed as if they had sat in different negotiating rooms. That agreement seemed to work for a year or so, but in recent months it has begun to fray, with American officials saying Japan is not living up to its commitments, and Japanese officials saying they never agreed to interfere with the operations of domestic automakers. **********No one would be surprised if the same happened in this case. ''This isn't the end of the issue, it's just the next step,'' a senior Administration official said. ''But we won't be spending the weekend watching on CNN while the Coast Guard pulls up next to Japanese freighters.'' **********The American negotiators were aided by the fact that even Japanese shipping companies have long chafed at the expensive, inefficient procedures at Japanese ports, though they have never had the political clout to subvert the control of the Japan Harbor Transport Association. So in an odd way they were allied with the Americans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/03/business/the-search-for-the-perfect-corporate-board.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1997-08-03", "snippet": "Analysis by The New York Times of data compiled by Directorship, consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn, finds that of 861 public companies on Fortune 1000 list, only one, Texas Instruments Inc, meets wide range of basic benchmarks of what is good cor...", "word_count": 2201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Search for the Perfect Corporate Board", "print_headline": "The Search for the Perfect Corporate Board", "body_text": " **********ARE stockholders asking for too much? **********One might think so from the sweeping set of proposals covering the structure of corporate boards that was issued recently by one of the biggest shareholders of them all, the California Public Employees' Retirement System. **********The list was remarkable both for the self-proclaimed importance of its mission -- ''to provide a benchmark of what is 'good' corporate governance'' -- and for its specificity, addressing everything from who should sit on certain committees to compensation for directors and term limits. **********There's only one problem: hardly any companies in the country even come close to filling the bill. **********An analysis by The New York Times of data compiled by Directorship, a consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn., shows that of the 861 public companies on the Fortune 1000 list, only one, Texas Instruments Inc., meets a wide range of basic Calpers tests, including having a majority of independent directors, a separate chief executive and independent chairman and independent committees for ethics, compensation, auditing, governance and board nominations. **********Texas Instruments also meets other criteria suggested by Calpers, whose $115 billion in assets makes it the largest public pension fund in the country. The big semiconductor maker has an age limit for directors, pays a significant part of the directors' compensation in company stock and does not provide retirement benefits to board members. In addition, its directors meet regularly without the chief executive. **********The New York Times analysis also yielded no clear pattern that would link ''good'' governance to good performance, an outcome that is consistent with many other studies. **********After all, while Texas Instruments has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since 1990, so has the company that fails the greatest number of basic Calpers tests: the Walt Disney Company. Its board lacks a majority of outside directors, its chairman and chief executive are the same person and a number of key committees are not made up entirely of independent directors. **********When told how the company's board fared against the Calpers guidelines, executives at Disney responded with a letter discussing the company's performance, including the fact that an investment made in Disney 12 years ago has grown at an average annual rate of 28.1 percent. **********The company said its strong performance was the direct result ''of the excellent stewardship of the Disney board of directors, one of the strongest groups of its kind in U.S. business.'' **********CALPERS, which has long been active in governance issues, says it isn't thrown by the results of the analysis. Good governance, it said, should be viewed as a kind of insurance policy to help all companies weather the inevitable difficult times. **********''Should Calpers wait until companies are in the dumper before asking them to have decent corporate governance?'' said Patricia K. Macht, a spokeswoman. **********Its suggested principles, the most far-reaching of several such efforts in recent years, should be viewed as a worthy goal, Calpers executives say. **********Although Calpers stopped short of adopting the principles because it wanted to study two of the proposals further, even the draft version released in June has heightened the scrutiny of companies and their boards. The draft immediately raised Calpers's profile in an arena where it had grown relatively quiet, but it also invited quick criticism that the guidelines were too restrictive and that Calpers was perhaps growing too meddlesome. **********''The pendulum has swung too far, and Calpers is starting to overreach,'' said John M. Nash, president of the National Association of Corporate Directors, which sponsored a commission last fall that issued a more modest set of recommendations on governance. **********The growing debate over the Calpers proposals underscores the lack of consensus about what constitutes a ''perfect'' board in the first place. **********While many of Calpers's principles are universally accepted, some are viewed as counterproductive. One guideline facing further study -- a limit on the number of directors who can be older than 70 -- has drawn the most fire. **********''Age limits would cut off too many good people with too much savvy,'' said Ralph D. Ward, editor of The Corporate Board magazine and author of ''21st Century Corporate Board'' (Wiley, 1997). ''I don't really believe Calpers wants to put in anything that firm.'' **********For Calpers, though, the debate over the proposals is almost as important as getting the companies in which it invests to fall in line, said William D. Crist, president of Calpers, based in Sacramento, Calif. **********''For a very long time, the makeup of corporate boards is a subject that has been ignored, and we do believe that the issue is very important going forward into a new global economy,'' Mr. Crist said. ''The dialogue that is going on is very healthy.'' **********The dialogue promises to become even more lively should Calpers formally adopt the principles, which it is expected to do later this year. At that point, Calpers will most likely send them to perhaps 500 of the largest public companies in which it owns stock and ask for explanations about how they meet the criteria. In areas where companies come up short, Calpers will expect to hear how they plan to measure up, including offering alternative ways to meet the spirit, if not the letter, of the guidelines. **********Calpers then plans to grade the companies and publicize the results. Uncooperative companies, Calpers executives say, will be prodded with proxy votes and shareholder proposals. **********Such a strategy strikes some experts in the field as unnecessarily heavy-handed. Ira M. Millstein, a partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges who led the commission last year that drew up governance principles for the National Association of Corporate Directors, said he had no objection to Calpers's sharing goals to which it thinks corporate America should aspire. But to then grade companies on how they measure up is not constructive, he said. **********''I don't think it's useful to put people in a bad light if they don't happen to follow what you think,'' Mr. Millstein said. **********IF nothing else, Calpers certainly has set an ambitious target for companies to meet. **********The analysis of the data compiled by Directorship showed that large numbers of companies fail some of the tests. For example, boards have for the most part purged their compensation committees of insiders because of the outcry some years back that too many executives were setting their own pay or that of their chums. Still, 77 of the 845 largest public companies that disclosed information about their compensation committee have at least one insider on the panel, which decides how well executives are paid. **********The UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, has two insiders on its compensation committee: Gerald Greenwald, the company's chairman, and Michael H. Glawe, chairman of United's pilot union. But John D. Kiker, a spokesman, said the company felt a need to put insiders on the committee because UAL is owned, in the main, by its employees. In addition, Mr. Greenwald routinely removes himself from committee discussions about his own compensation, Mr. Kiker said. **********Of the 140 companies that disclose information about their ethics committees, 21 have at least one insider on the panels. Disney has two insiders on its ethics committee: E. Cardon Walker and Raymond L. Watson, both former chairmen. **********With so many specific requirements -- there are 37 principles over all -- it is inevitable that many companies that have generally served their shareholders well will fail a number of the tests. **********The Calpers principles also include the recommendation that independent directors meet alone at least once a year; that the board designate a lead director when the chairman is also the chief executive and that a retiring chief executive not be allowed to continue serving on the board. **********Calpers categorizes 23 principles as ''fundamental'' and 14 as ''ideal.'' Calpers considers the age-limit proposal an ideal, which it would merely like companies to consider, as opposed to one of its fundamental criteria -- points on which it is less open to debate. **********The philosophical underpinnings of many of the guidelines are widely held notions about the wisdom of aligning the interests of board members more closely with shareholders  and otherwise making sure that boards are not too beholden to management. If there was a central message in a McKinsey & Company report from last fall that said major investors were willing to pay a premium price for companies that had good governance practices, for example, it was that directors should have a personal financial stake in running an effective board. **********Like Calpers, the commission formed last year by the National Association of Corporate Directors applauded the idea of paying directors in stock. **********One commission member, Charles Elson, a professor at the Stetson Law School in St. Petersburg, Fla., said stock ownership was the key to effective governance. Before Mr. Elson  joined the board of the Sunbeam Corporation, the company required him to buy 5,000 shares with his own money. He now owns 9,000 shares and was traveling around Mississippi last week visiting Sunbeam plants. **********''Calpers didn't tell me to do that -- my ownership led me to do that,'' he said. ''Most of this stuff makes sense.'' **********In the same vein, Russell S. Reynolds Jr., chairman of Directorship, attributes good corporate performance over the long term to ''oversight by a board of strong, independent people truly representing the long-term interests of all the shareholders.'' **********The kind of governance that is needed, however, is ''not necessarily that dictated in the recent flurry of governance guidelines,'' added Mr. Reynolds, whose firm evaluates board practices and helps recruit  directors. **********Indeed, some of Calpers's principles and what it plans to do with them have governance experts at odds over whether they would make things better or worse. **********In criticizing the proposal on age limits, Mr. Ward, editor of The Corporate Board, said that it would restrict corporate America's access to the many veteran business people who help guide fledgling companies through the difficult early years after an initial public offering. **********BUT Harvey J. Goldschmid, a professor at the Columbia University Law School, said that while  many directors remained effective after 70, age limits and term limits would be useful for companies that wanted some new and younger faces around the board-room table. **********''It solves the etiquette problem in a relatively blunt way, but for some companies, it may be the best way,'' Mr. Goldschmid said. ''It's difficult to tell directors they are no longer right for the job.'' **********The Digital Equipment Corporation, for example, has come under criticism from many investors for having five directors, more than half its board, who are at least 70, and who therefore came of age professionally well before the rise of the Internet and other milestones in the computer field. Digital has called the criticism misplaced. ''To criticize the effectiveness of anyone based on age is simply naive,'' Dan Kaferle, a Digital spokesman, said in June about the subject. **********The push to put limits on the age of board members is certainly at odds with the philosophy in countries like Britain and Japan, where gray hairs are regarded as assets for directors. The Calpers plan is more in tune with foreign practices when it comes to separating the jobs of chairman and chief executive, which companies in many other countries generally do. **********Ann Yerger, director of research for the Council of Institutional Investors, whose members include corporate, union and public pension funds like Calpers, predicted that some members would probably endorse all the Calpers principles. But, she added, a ''fair number'' of members would probably oppose at least some. **********Mr. Nash, the president of the corporate directors' association, said  Calpers had done a lot through the years to improve board performance, starting in the 1980's with its objections to, among other things, anti-takeover measures that protected incumbent managers and rewarded corporate raiders. **********But the growing scrutiny of boards may ultimately shrink the pool of capable directors, he contended. **********''Directors don't manage companies; managers manage companies,'' Mr. Nash said. ''Good directors are tired of having their reputations maligned in the public spotlight, and good people are going to say, 'I don't need this grief.' **********''I'm afraid overreaching is going to defeat the purpose,'' he added. ''And what are the next demands? I have no idea what they may be.'' **********For his part, Mr. Crist, the president of Calpers, defended the age-limit proposal as a way to guard against directors' growing too comfortable with one another. **********''Any age is arbitrary,'' Mr. Crist said. ''The point, if you do some historical research, is that a lot of corporate boards didn't replace members, and their members got older. It wasn't their age that was the problem, but that they had been talking to themselves for a very long time.'' **********MR. CRIST said Calpers would be flexible when it asks companies for report cards on how they measure up to the principles. After all, Calpers itself has reasons why it does not meet all of its criteria, including the fact that some directors have served for more than 10 years. The people who make up the membership of the California Public Employees' Retirement System do not elect all its directors -- the board also includes political appointees and officers of state agencies. **********''Moses didn't send these things down from the mountain, and we certainly don't expect all boards to toe the line precisely,'' Mr. Crist said. ''There is no simple, perfect formula. We're not in a chemistry lab here making a compound.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/28/business/protecting-america-s-shores-from-those-chinese-crawfish.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Passell", "pub_date": "1997-08-28", "snippet": "Economic Scene column on Louisiana's crawfish growers' anti-dumping suit against their Chinese competitors, which is likely to be decided by US International Trade Commission; holds case illustrates core asymmetry built into America's anti-dumping...", "word_count": 762, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Protecting America's shores from those Chinese crawfish.", "print_headline": "Protecting America's shores from those Chinese crawfish.", "body_text": " **********ANTI-DUMPING laws, remnant of an era when imports mattered little to Americans' standard of living, are intended to give domestic producers an edge over foreign rivals. And thanks to the tilted playing field, consumers pay more for everything from cement to honey. **********Few cases illustrate the point better than Louisiana's crawfish growers' suit against their Chinese competitors, likely to be decided tomorrow by the quasi-judicial United States International Trade Commission. Indeed, few so clearly make the point that the real thrust of anti-dumping laws is to limit foreign competition. ''Most anti-dumping cases are nasty,'' said Greg Rushford, publisher of the Rushford Report, a newsletter on trade policy. ''This one is super-nasty.'' **********Crawfish, freshwater crustaceans that are used in jambalaya, etouffee and all manner of other Creole dishes, used to come almost exclusively from Louisiana. Fresh whole crawfish command premium prices from local gourmets, while the frozen tail meat ends up in a thousand restaurants across the country. But since weather problems severely disrupted production in 1994 and 1995, the state has lost its market dominance. Some 80 percent of the frozen variety now come from private farmers in Jiangsu Province, China. **********Last year the Louisiana businesses that process raw crawfish persuaded the State Legislature to appropriate $350,000 to petition the Commerce Department for protection, charging that Chinese farmers were selling crawfish below cost. That might seem a bit counterproductive for the state government. ''Louisiana taxpayers are, in effect, paying a lawyer in Washington to drive up the price of their gumbo,'' Mr. Rushford noted.'' **********But it is certainly no odder than the Commerce Department's response. Because China is not a member of the World Trade Organization and is officially viewed as a ''nonmarket economy,'' the department was not required to rely on the actual cost of production to determine the ''fair'' price of crawfish grown in ponds by Chinese farmers. **********Instead, it used the cost of fish caught at sea in ''comparable'' economies with free markets -- India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Transport costs within China were estimated from a 1994 newspaper report on trucking costs in India. And for good measure, the bean counters threw in some numbers on the cost of Spanish imports of live crawfish from Portugal. **********Absurd? Of course. But legal, according to Lawrence White of New York University's Stern School of Business. ''Loony Tunes assumptions'' are built into the anti-dumping laws in order to give domestic producers maximum advantage,  said Mr. White, the former chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division. **********The calculations got the Commerce Department's Import Administration, which generally looks to protectionists in Congress rather than the White House for inspiration, where it wanted to go. The agency has set anti-dumping duties ranging from 85 to 201 percent of the price the Chinese charge, implying that Chinese crawfish farmers have been dumb enough to sell their product for just one-third to two-thirds of production costs. **********For the anti-dumping duties to go into effect, the International Trade Commission must also rule that Louisiana producers have been ''injured'' by Chinese sales. And while the commission is also inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to special-interest pleadings, it has historically been more willing to take the interests of consumers into account, too. **********To try to sway the commissioners, lawyers for the Chinese exporters are arguing that the anti-dumping petition was the culmination of a failed campaign by Louisiana business to run up the price of crawfish and to persuade the Chinese to cooperate in cartelizing the market. They introduced a letter from a Louisiana import company, New Phoenix/Sterling, to China's Ambassador to the United States, asking Beijing to lean on crawfish producers to limit exports to three million pounds annually. **********''As long as China is working with New Phoenix/ Sterling on the above mentioned base, Chinese crawfish can be in the market for a long time without facing the anti-dumping threat and lose the $10 million/year business,'' wrote Eugene Ji, the company's president. **********The International Trade Commission (or the courts) will have to decide whether the motives of importers are germane to the legal issue of injury. But this relatively minor trade brouhaha does neatly illustrate the core asymmetry built into America's anti-dumping laws. Ford can charge any price to grab market share from Chrysler, unless the intent is to put Chrysler out of business. But foreigners are held to a different standard -- one that puts the Commerce Department in the position of setting and enforcing minimum prices when the low-cost producer is not American. **********''The laws invite attempts to monopolize'' that would never be tolerated in a purely American industry,'' Mr. White concluded."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/16/business/key-rates-147419.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/20/business/company-news-ipc-to-be-acquired-by-cable-systems-holding.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-12-20", "snippet": "IPC Information Systems Inc to be acquired by Cable Systems Holding LLC and its Cable Systems International unit; acquisition is valued at $253 million, including debt (S)", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IPC TO BE ACQUIRED BY CABLE SYSTEMS HOLDING", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; IPC TO BE ACQUIRED BY CABLE SYSTEMS HOLDING", "body_text": " **********IPC Information Systems Inc., a maker of financial trading systems, will be acquired by Cable Systems Holding L.L.C. and its Cable Systems International Inc. unit, IPC said yesterday.

The nation's real estate developers, after their crazed overbuilding in the 1980's helped ruin hundreds of banks and savings and loans, are starting to put up speculative office buildings again, breaking ground before they know who will fill most of their floors. **********The developers swear on a stack of blueprints that they will not repeat their past excesses. Instead of building sky-scraping, marble-clad, sculpture-bedecked urban spires, they are mostly constructing squat boxes, often varying in little but trim, in outlying suburbs. In other words, McOffices. **********''Underneath, it's the same building,'' one Atlanta developer, Don Childress, said without apology of the four six-story buildings he has started since he resumed office construction a year ago. **********Economic growth and new hiring are feeding the resurgence in building, but there are other reasons, too. Cost-conscious tenants like the thrifty image these surroundings convey. Though bent on squeezing more employees into less space, they often need newer buildings with more parking and the heavier utility service that technological advances demand. **********''The glamour, the grandiose styles, the palaces -- they're gone,'' said Douglas A. Tibbetts, president of the real estate arm of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, which a decade ago backed the nation's flashiest developers. ''Today, people need something that looks efficient.'' **********The resumption of office construction, though still modest, represents a turning point in a commercial real estate market that saw the worth of some buildings fall by half since the late 80's. The value of all commercial real estate now stands at $3.2 trillion. **********Office building came to a virtual standstill for several years, with a low of only 1.6 million square feet -- the equivalent of less than two 50-story buildings -- completed in the entire nation in 1994. In 1986, developers finished more space than that every five days, with most of that fifth day left for topping-out parties. In all, 139.9 million square feet of office space was completed that year, as much as if the nation's developers had built another Houston, with all its suburbs, from scratch. **********Last year, new office space was back up to 6.6 million square feet, and Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate services firm, estimates that 13 million will be completed this year, the most since 1992. **********More than three-quarters of the new buildings under construction at the end of 1996 were speculative, accounting for most of the gain, the firm reports. For much of the 90's, speculative construction essentially ceased. **********The return of building on speculation, beginning about a year and a half ago, is concentrated in -- but not confined to -- the South and Southwest. Suburban Atlanta, Phoenix and Dallas are among the hottest markets. New speculative buildings are also going up, though, in North Jersey and the suburbs of Chicago and Washington. **********About the only exceptions to the Edge City trend are a few towers planned in urban centers like Times Square in Manhattan. **********Often, the new offices are going up in metropolitan areas where the downtowns still languish and entire office towers remain shuttered and vacant. In Dallas, the downtown vacancy rate is more than 35 percent, the highest in the nation. But in the sprawling Dallas suburbs of Plano and Irving -- out where companies like E.D.S., Exxon and J. C. Penney are based -- many of the nation's largest developers and financial institutions are vying to fill the demand for more space. Tenants see the suburbs providing newer quarters, with more parking and shorter commutes. **********Nationally, rental rates have been rising as suburban vacancy rates have dropped from 21.4 percent in early 1992 to 12.9 percent at the end of last year, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Downtown office space has filled up, too, but more slowly, with vacancies falling from nearly 20 percent to 14.8 percent over the same period. **********And investors' cash is again flowing into real estate, some of it seeking havens that seem safer than a sky-scraping stock market. ''We are flush with capital,'' said Arthur J. Mirante 2d, Cushman & Wakefield's chief executive, speaking of the national trend. ''But everyone remembers what happened in the 80's.'' **********Back then, lenders pressed developers to take their money and build whatever they wanted, requiring them to put up only 5 percent of the costs, or sometimes nothing. Citicorp aimed to back the nation's top 10 developers, while Equitable financed such major builders as John C. Portman of Atlanta, the Crow family of Dallas and Donald J. Trump. **********Today, lenders demand that developers put up 20 percent of the costs. They want to see stable or rising population and employment figures and marketing studies with evidence of rental rates high enough to support new construction. They check out the reliability of contractors and architects. And then they might only do business with developers who did not default before. **********Wall Street has given hordes of individual investors the chance to buy in with real estate investment trusts, or REIT's. Some insurers are still selling off their real estate, but pension funds and REIT's are taking their places. **********Few real estate analysts or economists see any signs that another crash is imminent. Many of the savings and loans and other rash lenders are gone, and there is no prospect of the sort of tax code changes that punctured real estate values in the late 80's. Those changes undid many of the tax shelter features that had caused investors to flock to real estate earlier in the decade. **********According to Donald Ratajczak, director of the Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting Center, the long real estate cycle that bottomed out in 1992 is still on the upswing, so that any downturns at this stage will be short. **********Even so, telecommuting and corporate cost-cutting continue to constrain demand for new space. Besides, many areas still have plenty of space left over from the last binge. Some Houston buildings that were completely mothballed are only now being unlocked and leased. **********Developing offices remains a lot like playing a casino's baccarat tables, which offers plenty of cachet but the highest stakes and risks. Homes, apartments, shopping centers and warehouses have all come back first. **********To limit their risks, most developers and lenders shun overbearing high-rises that take two or three years to finish, then another few years to fully lease. Instead, they are often doing suburban structures so simple to finance and build that they might as well be inflatable. If a decade ago construction cranes towered to the upper reaches of urban skylines, this time most of them are all but hidden among suburban trees. **********Back in the 80's, Mr. Childress, a former Trammell Crow partner who founded Childress Klein Properties in Atlanta, won architectural plaudits for a Peachtree Street high-rise that featured travertine marble outside, bronze sconces and chandeliers in the lobby. **********His latest buildings, each of the same size and shape, take no more than nine months to build, so that he and his lenders, primarily the First Union and Wachovia banks, are not gambling on the market's long-term strength. **********The only stone on the facade of his Windward I building in the fringe suburb of Alpharetta, Ga., is a few narrow bands of granite around the entrance, with glass and precast concrete elsewhere. Windward II next door dispensed with the stone altogether. **********Both were started without any takers for a majority of the space, but now only a single floor in just one building is left. **********Even the few taller buildings that are going up reflect lower-rise ambitions. **********In the late 1980's, Equitable Real Estate Investment Management designed Monarch Tower, in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood, as a 30-story octagonal showpiece. Over the top, in more ways than one, was an illuminated dome, flanked by four smaller domes at the corners, made entirely of gleaming stainless steel, a building material even more expensive than brass. **********Finally, a few years ago, Equitable executives realized that reality had overtaken their costly plans. A different Monarch Tower was started in June 1995 and opened to its first tenants at the beginning of this year -- the first speculative project of the new wave, says Equitable, the nation's largest real estate investor. **********Instead of a 30-story octagon, the building became a 24-story box, the only flourish being 12-foot ceilings on the top floor at the request of an aluminum company's executives. **********Grant A. Grimes, the building's developer, flogs the new design the way Home Depot flogs do-it-yourself kitchen cabinets. Striding into the compact lobby, he points to some surfaces with a stucco finish and others that are nothing but whitewashed drywall. **********''In the 80's, the lobby would have huge volumes of space, massive amounts of stone -- marble, marble, marble,'' he said, waving his arms. ''They wanted that prestige. They wanted it to look horribly expensive.'' **********He lowered his arms and his voice to continue. ''In the 90's, they want it to look professional, but they don't want it to look so opulent that when they bring a client in, they say, 'I can't afford you.' '' **********When construction began, only half the space was leased, including several floors for some Equitable operations. Now, it is more than 90 percent taken, a year ahead of schedule. Equitable plans another building just across the street. **********But Equitable remains cautious in a broader sense than design. The parent company -- having, like other insurers, sold off billions in real estate -- has not put its own money in the newer projects. Though the company plans to keep much of the real estate it still has, it is discussing the sale of its real estate development, management and finance operations to the Lend Lease Corporation of Sydney, Australia. **********Some developers are even now wondering when to expect the next bust. Atlanta already faces something of an apartment glut, and developers have filed zoning requests to build millions more square feet of office space in the Buckhead area. **********''I'm absolutely a believer in the business cycle,'' Mr. Childress said, recalling that he made no profits from 1990 through mid-1993. ''When things get too good, they will be overbuilt. You have a few cows go, and then the herd starts running. It's happened all my life, so why would it change now?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/30/business/one-club-to-honor-2-executives.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1997-01-30", "snippet": "One Club for Art and Copy to induct Lee Clow and Jim Durfee into its Creative Hall of Fame (S)", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "One Club to Honor 2 Executives", "print_headline": "One Club to Honor 2 Executives", "body_text": " **********The One Club for Art and Copy in New York will induct two more executives into its Creative Hall of Fame.

First David Spade and then Chris Rock hawked MCI Communications calls. Paul Reiser, the star of ''Mad About You,'' trolled for AT&T customers. And now, Mr. Miller is pitching the BellSouth Corporation, the Atlanta-based Baby Bell serving the Southeast, in addition to his work as a spokesmanfor Mars Inc.'s M&M's. **********Indeed, advertising agencies are sensing a billing bonanza as phone companies scramble for customers in the wake of Congress's overhaul of telecommunications regulations last year. Nationwide, ''you're probably seeing and feeling a more aggressive marketing posture than you've ever seen from the Bells before,'' said William C. Pate, vice president of advertising at BellSouth. **********AT&T spent $498.1 million on advertising in the first 11 months of last year, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a unit of R. C. Auletta & Company that tracks advertising spending. MCI spent $287.2 million and Sprint $236.4 million during the same period. Spending by the Baby Bells ranged from $24.2 million (U.S. West Inc.) to $60.3 million (BellSouth) during that period, Competitive Media Reporting said. **********While the advertising budgets for most of those companies were little changed from the previous year, BellSouth was an exception, raising its spending by more than 50 percent from $40.7 million in 1995. And this year, BellSouth plans to accelerate its spending to somewhere between $100 million and $150 million, mainly in the Southeast. The big outlays are a defensive move -- BellSouth wants to create loyal customers before newcomers try to steal its callers. **********''We know that the long-distance companies, when they come into the region, are going to spend a lot of money in advertising,'' Mr. Pate said. ''We are going to make sure those companies can't come in and buy our customers.'' **********BellSouth has already signed three-year sponsorship agreements with the Atlanta Braves, the Florida Marlins and a NASCAR car-racing team, which Mr. Pate called ''the things that draw Southerners.'' And it already uses a number of Southern-bred celebrities -- including Dixie Carter, Kathleen Turner and Naomi Judd -- to build loyalty. **********BellSouth is also trying to raise its stature outside of the Southeast with a year's worth of prominent ads in USA Today starting March 10. **********In its saucy ad campaign with Dennis Miller, the company is touting BellSouth Mobility, the cellular and digital calling arm of BellSouth, which has customers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. **********The regional ad campaign was created by West Wayne Inc., the independent, Atlanta-based company formed when BellSouth's longtime advertising agency, Atlanta-based Tucker Wayne, merged with the West Group in Tampa, Fla. Three television ads began running earlier this month on prime-time shows like ''Friends,'' ''ER'' and ''Seinfeld.'' Three radio ads also began playing at the same time, and the company plans a blitz of newspaper and billboard ads across the region. **********One of the three new television commercials shows Mr. Miller in a convertible, pretending to drive along an obviously fake highway, as various backgrounds roll by. **********First cowboys on horseback gallop up to the car as Mr. Miller drives and talks on a cell phone. Then, the palm-lined boulevards of Los Angeles become the backdrop, followed by the farmlands of Minnesota. ''You are supposed to think I'm traveling cross-country,'' Mr. Miller tells viewers. ''Only BellSouth Mobility gives you a single nationwide roaming rate from sea to shining sea.'' Television and print ads use the slogan, ''BellSouth Mobility, count on it.'' **********West Wayne plans to begin showing three fresh ads with Mr. Miller in about three months. By then, even more phone company commercials will be competing on American television channels. **********''The competitive arena is growing like crazy because of deregulation,'' said Martin A.

The article drew varied responses from readers. **********To the Editor: **********The reason that ''wealth effect'' is not working is not so mysterious. Despite the explosion of American wealth, consumer spending is so low because business is cutting wages of employees, who spend 95 percent of their income in the consumer economy. **********In the 1990's, the dominant corporate profit strategy has been to cut labor costs, which account for two-thirds of the cost of producing products and services. This dramatically increases corporate profits, which increases stock prices. This has been done through approaches like downsizing, building an army of low-paid contingent workers, offering lower wage increases, ending cost-of-living increases, cutting health and pension benefits and outsourcing. **********In America's golden economic age, the quarter-century ending in 1973, the real wages of Americans -- including the middle class -- doubled. The secret of a successful American economy is a large, successful middle class -- because employees are also consumers. **********In another age of so-called prosperity, the 1920's, there were big increases in corporate profits but not in manufacturing employees' wages. In 1929, many people ran out of purchasing power, sales collapsed, the stock market crashed, and the country fell into the Great Depression. **********Are there any signs of this today? Absolutely. Many consumers are mired in debt  because they earn less than they spend, and personal bankruptcies are at an all-time high. **********The new explosion of wealth has had a negative effect on consumer purchasing power in the current economy. **********LOUIS COHEN **********Manhattan, March 3"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/29/world/latest-swiss-bank-surprise-secrets-from-the-shredder.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1997-07-29", "snippet": "Union Bank of Switzerland says it has duplicates of some of documents rescued from shredding by a security guard in January and that it has unearthed evidence 'possibly' related to sale of Jewish property in Berlin during Nazi era; refused for mon...", "word_count": 776, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Latest Swiss Bank Surprise: Secrets From the Shredder", "print_headline": "Latest Swiss Bank Surprise: Secrets From the Shredder", "body_text": " **********After refusing for months to publicly discuss the content of files rescued from shredding by a security guard last winter, Switzerland's biggest bank said today that it had duplicates of some of the documents and that it had unearthed evidence ''possibly'' related to the sale of Jewish property in Berlin during the Nazi years. **********The Union Bank of Switzerland said the documents were from a small bank it acquired after the war. From the archives and from further investigation, the Union Bank said, it concluded that the smaller bank bought 31 properties in Germany, including 20 from a Swiss family and ''possibly'' 3 from Jews in the Berlin area in 1937. **********At the time, Jews faced an array of Nazi regulations forcing them to sell land and other property. The statement by the Union Bank said a German bank had acted as intermediary in those transactions. **********The disclosure was made only days after another of the country's biggest banks -- Swiss Bank Corporation -- said it had failed until recently to identify dormant accounts worth some $11 million from the Nazi era. That disclosure deepened a crisis of confidence in the banks' candor about a wartime history that critics have assailed as one of collaboration with Nazi Germany. **********On Wednesday, under growing pressure from American Jewish organizations and international investigators, Swiss banks took the unparalleled step of releasing a list of 1,756 accounts that had lain dormant since May 9, 1945 -- the day after the end of World War II in Europe. **********But when the list was published in 28 newspapers worldwide and on the Internet, it plunged the banks into new questioning, because it showed that some accounts might have been held by high-ranking Nazis and that others contained German assets that the wartime Allies had wanted handed over for postwar reparations. **********The newest disclosure had its beginnings in January when Christoph Meili, a security guard working for a private company at the Union Bank of Switzerland, came across documents being shredded in the bank's cellar and rescued some of them, which he handed over to a Jewish organization in Zurich. **********Dismissed from his job, Mr. Meili later fled to the United States, saying he felt that his life was in danger. Moves are under way in Congress to accord him and his family permanent residence rights. **********At the time, the bank declined to go into detail about the files. **********The Union Bank said at the time that the files had originated with a small bank, the Eidgenossische Bank, which was known to have had widespread business interests in Nazi Germany and which faltered at the end of the war. Union Bank of Switzerland bought it at that time. **********The bank acknowledged in January that the destruction of the files was a breach of a new law intended to preserve such files for investigation by a commission of historians. Today, it said the shredding ''was not a deliberate act on the part of the bodies responsible'' at the bank. **********The Union Bank said it had located details of 65 real estate files that Mr. Meili had saved from the shredder. It said the files had originally been held by Eidgenossische Bank. Forty-nine of them related to property maintenance, it said. **********It said it had kept duplicates of 26 of the files, and that 47 of the files rescued by Mr. Meili related to the period leading up to the end of the war, while 18 related to the postwar era. The statement said the Union Bank based its disclosures today on documents from the Eidgenossische Bank's archives and from ''additional investigations carried out at land registration offices in Germany.'' **********''In the case of three properties,'' the statement said, ''for the purpose of which a German bank in 1937 acted as intermediary and whose previous owners were possibly Jews, the minutes of the board of directors meetings and other documents are in existence.'' **********Gertrud Erismann, a spokeswoman for the Union Bank, said the bank had compiled the information it released today last March but had not released it because of official investigations relating to Mr. Meili's actions and the actions of the employee who shredded the documents. **********But with renewed attention to the issue in Switzerland, ''what we wanted to do was to really tell what's in the documents,'' Ms. Erismann said.

Monks, the Taxpayer Advocate. **********This, however, seems certain to change. The I.R.S., responding to a stinging set of recent Senate hearings that disclosed abusive collection practices, said it would throw open its doors one Saturday a month so taxpayers with unresolved cases can meet face to face with agency officials in hopes of resolving disputes. **********The first session is scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 15, at 33 district offices staffed from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. by officials who have a wide range of duties and expertise. The Nov. 15 sites include the district offices in Manhattan (212 436-1013), Brooklyn (718 488-3601) Newark (973 645-3886) and Hartford (860 240-4156). Thereafter, sessions will be rotated within districts (there will be one in each district each month, but the cities will change), and the hours may be modified to include, say, weekday evenings. **********Such forums are the outgrowth of a program that has sprung up in the last few years in the I.R.S. offices in Greensboro, N.C., and other cities. While the first forums were considered successful models, relatively few taxpayers showed up, perhaps, the I.R.S. says, for lack of publicity. **********This time, though, I.R.S. officials plan heavy publicity. Also, they request -- but do not insist -- that taxpayers make a telephone reservation. For other sites and reservations, taxpayers can call the I.R.S. at (800) 829-1040. **********Mr. Monks says the sessions are intended to tackle any longstanding tax problems. But he adds that he is aiming mainly to resolve cases involving uncredited payments, scrambled Social Security numbers, delayed refunds, requests for abatement of various penalties, discrepancies between returns and Form 1099's filed directly by banks and other payers, and situations in which a taxpayer faces severe hardship from impending collection. **********''We can cut through these pretty fast,'' he said, perhaps resolving a case in as little as 15 minutes. Others, of course, could take hours or may have to be resolved in other ways. **********But taxpayers should not come to sessions to ask for advice on, say, whether something is deductible or how to survive an audit. **********''This is not a day to come in and ask technical tax questions,'' Mr. Monks said. And the Taxpayer Advocate never intervenes when I.R.S. enforcers have begun a formal audit. **********Could Mr. Monks himself become a casualty of the new I.R.S. approach to taxpayer problems? Charles O. Rossotti, the new Commissioner of Internal Revenue, said during hearings in October that the Taxpayer Advocate was so important that he would select a future advocate from outside the agency to make sure the official is regarded as an independent ally of the taxpayer. **********Some tax experts have greeted the trouble-shooting sessions with what might be called skeptical enthusiasm. **********''This is something that should have begun a long time ago,'' said Richard Davis, who once worked in the chief counsel's office at the I.R.S. and is now an assistant professor of accounting at Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pa. **********But he wondered about the agency's ability to bring its antiquated computer system to bear on individual cases and whether its workers would be given enough discretion to resolve disputes. No matter how good the planning, Professor Davis added, ''They're still limited by the resources they have.'' **********Gerry W. Padwe, vice president for taxation at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, pointed to ''continuing problems with overlapping communications'' at the I.R.S. that seem to confound the agency's most strenuous efforts. ''Before they have processed your response, the computer spits out a new notice,'' he said. **********And Claude Renshaw, professor of business at St. Mary's College in South Bend, Ind., said he doubted that the I.R.S. was capable of conducting a ''warm and fuzzy'' cut-the-red-tape program. ''I'd like to see them pull it off,'' he said. ''But up until now, they've been reluctant to do things other than through channels.'' **********But while Mr. Monks expressed confidence that the agency's computers would be able to quickly call up taxpayers' accounts and that there would be plenty of expertise and authority on hand at the Saturday sessions, he acknowledged the risk that expectations could go too high. ''We don't want to make it seem like we can work miracles,'' he said, noting that resolution does not have to mean that one side capitulates but instead can produce compromises. **********Should a taxpayer exhaust the normal remedies, there is always a last resort -- Form 911, used to apply for something called a taxpayer assistance order. Providing you can show hardship in getting necessities like food or medical care, this form would prevent the agency from getting at your pay or bank account. **********Mr. Monks said that about 32,000 people  ''dialed'' 911 each year and that about half the pleas were accepted."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/07/world/a-sri-lankan-priest-is-excommunicated-for-his-relativism.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1997-01-07", "snippet": "Rev Tissa Balasuriya, 72-year-old Sri Lankan priest, is excommunicated by Vatican for allegedly deviating from integrity and truth of Catholic faith; is accused of challenging such basic Roman Catholic beliefs as original sin and Immaculate Concep...", "word_count": 1176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Sri Lankan Priest Is Excommunicated For His 'Relativism'", "print_headline": "A Sri Lankan Priest Is Excommunicated For His 'Relativism'", "body_text": " **********The Roman Catholic Church rarely talks these days of  heresy, a verdict that carries eerie echoes of the Inquisition and ends in automatic excommunication, the harshest penalty in canon law.

Tissa Balasuriya something of a cause celebre among third-world theologians who have followed his ordeal before the Vatican authorities with both sympathy and dread.

Charles E. Curran, who taught at Catholic University in Washington, D.C., and the school of liberation theologians from Latin America whose anti-establishment, populist views often overlapped with leftist social ideals in the 1970's and 80's. The Vatican stopped short of excommunicating Father Kung and Father Curran, and only barred them from teaching Catholic theology. **********''This is much tougher,'' Father Kung said today in a telephone interview about Father Balasuriya's case, ''perhaps because he is a third-world theologian.

This is the system as it works, and as it will work as long as Catholicism doesn't get rid of a doctrine that says that the Pope is always right.'' **********In an address to heads of doctrinal commissions from around the world in May in Guadalajara, Mexico, Cardinal Ratzinger, who is seen as Pope John Paul II's principal doctrinal watchdog, laid out the dangers of a blend of the West's secular relativism and the ''philosophical and religious intuitions of Asia, especially and surprisingly with those of the Indian subcontinent.'' **********From the marriage of those trends, he said, is born the religious relativism that is unacceptable for the Catholic Church. **********''The faith, together with its practice, either comes to us from the Lord through his church and the sacramental ministry, or it does not exist in absolute,'' Cardinal Ratzinger said. **********By excommunicating Father Balasuriya, the Vatican has sent its message in an even more forceful way. **********''They want to menace everyone else who is in this field,'' Father Kung said. ''Unfortunately it is an efficient method because now every stupid theologian in India can accuse others of defending what Father Balasuriya was saying.'' **********The case against Father Balasuriya, who is a sociologist as well as a theologian, began in 1993, when the Catholic Bishops' Conference in Sri Lanka called for an investigation into his latest book, ''Mary and Human Liberation.'' The book took a critical look at the devotion accorded  the Virgin Mary, in particular her image as a ''Mary of the capitalist, patriarchal, colonialist first world of Christendom'' whose ''perpetual virginity'' makes her ''a dehydrated figure who is not quite human.'' **********Father Balasuriya, who has been  promoting a dialogue among the island nation's religions, argued in that and other books that Christianity and Catholicism must go further to acknowledge the legitimacy of other faiths. **********He has also challenged the view that humans are born ''alienated from God,'' a challenge that his critics say contradicts the Catholic belief in original sin. **********By July 1994, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith compiled an 11-page critique of Father Balasuriya's views, much of which he later dismissed as a ''misrepresentation.'' In due course, he sent off a 55-page response to which he received a one-word reply: ''Unsatisfactory.'' **********And so the exchange continued, with never, Father Balasuriya said,  an opportunity for the constructive dialogue on religious issues that he always wanted. ''There has been no face-to-face contact with the unknown officials at the congregation,'' he said in a statement issued today. **********He argued that the Vatican, halfway around the world in overwhelmingly Catholic Italy, is in no position to judge the rights and wrongs of  scholars working in multi-denominational cultures like Sri Lanka, where most people, about 69 percent, are Buddhists, about 15 percent are Hindus, and Christians and Muslims each make up less than 8 percent of the population. **********''This has raised the question of whether or not the local church should not be solving these issues, and not unknown persons in Rome, dealing in Italian,'' he said. ''Due process in the church must be clarified.'' **********Finally, in May 1996, the Vatican, clearly exasperated by the drawn-out epistolary exchange, sent Father Balasuriya a long ''profession of faith,'' which it insisted he sign ''to verify if you accept the truths'' taught by the church. Included was a paragraph explicitly acknowledging the Vatican's hard-line position against the ordination of women. **********For this and other reasons, Father Balasuriya refused to sign the specially written profession of faith, and opted instead to sign a similar one,  without the clause on women priests.  That approach was rejected by the Vatican, and after a last-minute appeal to Pope John Paul II himself, the congregation started to move slowly but inexorably toward its final judgment, officially rendered on Jan. 2 and published on Jan. 5. **********For other members of the Oblates order, the fate of Father Balasuriya has been a painful episode, pitting personal loyalties against faith. ''I love my order; the fraternal bonds are very strong,'' said the Rev. Alexandre Tache, procurator general of the order based here in Rome, ''but you have to respect the mission of the church. The Pope and the bishops have a responsibility for teaching by the Scriptures, for interpreting by tradition.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/16/world/un-names-slovenia-to-security-council.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-10-16", "snippet": "Slovenia becomes first former Yugoslav republic to be elected to rotating seat on United Nations Security Council; others elected are Bahrain, Gambia, Brazil and Gabon (S)", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

One possibility, proposed by Indonesia today, is that the I.M.F. could earmark a standby fund that would be intended to stabilize the Indonesian currency on world markets and ease concerns of investors and of businesses that trade with the country. Another approach would be short-term I.M.F. loans similar to those earlier to Thailand. **********In Thailand, a group of nations led by the I.M.F. put together a $17 billion bailout. The Thai currency, the baht, had been weakened by speculative attacks, and its fall of nearly 40 percent in value set off a chain reaction through the region. **********In contrast to Thailand, financial analysts continued to describe the Indonesian economy as fundamentally sound. Banks are not as overextended, debt is not as high and foreign reserves are substantial -- enough, the Government said today, to cover five months of imports. **********As recently as last month, the I.M.F. praised Indonesia for reducing spending and instituting economic changes. The spending cuts included the suspension of $13 billion in construction projects, some of them controlled by relatives of the President, and the Government affirmed today that those suspensions would remain in force. **********Although Indonesia still has about $20 billion in foreign-exchange reserves, Finance Minister Marie Muhammad said, ''In order to safeguard the situation, the Government is sounding out long-term support funds from international institutions, including the I.M.F.'' **********He said that any such assistance would be temporary, and added: ''The Government will not draw on the fund unless it is really necessary. Our approach to it will be the same as a standby loan. You only withdraw it if you need it.'' **********He also affirmed that the exchange value of the rupiah would continue to float freely but that the Government would take measures to avoid sharp drops or fluctuation. **********Today's action was a new sign of the troubles that are infecting most of the recently surging economies of the region. Currencies have plummeted, large-scale construction projects have been put on hold, stock markets are in trouble and personal spending has suddenly been scaled back in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines as well as Indonesia. Even the Singapore dollar, traditionally a strong and stable currency, has dipped in value. **********In Indonesia, the rupiah has fallen more than 30 percent in value against the dollar over the last two months, despite two interventions by the nation's central bank. A crisis atmosphere and talk of a possible bailout emerged after the rupiah dropped sharply over the last week. **********Indonesia's economic problems, coming five months before the expected re-election of President Suharto to a sixth five-year term, are the latest in a series of calamities there. The nation has been embarrassed by its inability to control vast, man-made forest fires that have blanketed parts of five other Asian countries with a choking smog. **********The worst drought in 50 years is parching broad areas of plantations and rice fields, bringing outbreaks of disease and causing hundreds of deaths. **********Two weeks ago, Indonesia suffered the worst air crash in its history, in which 234 were killed. Two days later, 16 people died in an earthquake. **********Economists said today that the appeal for economic assistance was aimed in good part at shoring up faith in the health and stability of the nation, the world's fourth most populous after China, India and the United States. ''This is a strategy intended to restore confidence,'' said Ng Bok Eng, a senior economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research in Jakarta. ''And it is pragmatic, realistic and achievable.'' **********The strategy, announced after a Cabinet meeting led by President Suharto, 76, included steps that appeared intended to prevent possible social unrest. ''All relevant ministers and institutions are to safeguard stocks of essential goods and to strive to maintain price stability,'' the Government said in a statement. **********Though the Indonesian economy has grown dramatically during Mr. Suharto's three-decade-plus tenure, social and economic inequalities remain sharp. If the Government does accept aid from the I.M.F., economists said, the agency could require difficult and unpopular economic measures like a cut in fuel subsidies. **********Over the last year, Indonesia has been shaken by a series of communal riots, and in a speech on Sunday, Mr. Suharto told the military to be prepared for further unrest. **********In addition to currency problems, Indonesia's economic outlook has darkened in recent months. On Tuesday, the Government announced that inflation in September had climbed to 7.1 percent, from 5.7 percent in August. **********Economists are also lowering their 1997 growth forecasts to 3 or 4 percent, down one percentage point from predictions made just a few weeks ago. **********Foreign debt by private business has also become a serious concern. Of an estimated $55 billion in private debt, at least $25 billion falls due by next summer. Economists said much of the recent fall in the rupiah had been caused by panic buying of dollars by private companies facing debt deadlines. The measures announced by the Government today did not directly address this issue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/13/business/key-rates-078409.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-09-13", "snippet": "Table shows key interest rates", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/20/business/key-rates-700509.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/30/business/markets-surge-as-labor-costs-stay-in-check.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1997-04-30", "snippet": "Stock market rockets to its greatest gain in over five years--2.64 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average--when Employment Cost Index, key economic indicator measuring labor costs, shows no sign of inflation despite robust economy and many r...", "word_count": 1039, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Markets Surge As Labor Costs Stay in Check", "print_headline": "Markets Surge As Labor Costs Stay in Check", "body_text": " **********The stock market rocketed yesterday to its greatest gain in more than five years because a key economic indicator, measuring labor costs, showed no sign of inflation despite a robust economy and many reports that skilled workers are increasingly hard to find. **********Nothing in the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of what employers pay for workers, suggested that rising labor costs might soon force companies to raise their prices. Wages did rise modestly, but not across the board. And outlays for benefits like health insurance and pensions were almost unchanged. **********The mild inflation report, showing a rise in employment costs of just six-tenths of 1 percent for the first quarter, took some of the steam out of the view on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve would soon feel compelled to raise interest rates again to slow the economy. **********In the bond market, interest rates fell sharply, and stock prices, which thrive on expectations of lower interest rates, shot up. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 179 points, or 2.64 percent, the largest percentage increase since Dec. 23, 1991, when it soared 3 percent. $(Page D1.$) **********''There is no question this is a better labor cost report than we had anticipated,'' said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman,  Sachs & Company. **********For the Clinton Administration, the modest labor cost increase was unthreatening to the economy, easing off as it did from a rise of eight-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter. ''I don't see any inflationary pressure in this report,'' said Janet L. Yellen, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. **********The Employment Cost Index, in effect, contradicted a different measure of labor costs that had been rising rather sharply each month since November. That measure -- average hourly earnings for production workers below the rank of supervisor -- caught the attention of Wall Street and set off alarm bells after it rose in March at an annual rate of 4 percent. The expectation was that the broader cost index, covering all workers, would finally reflect the sharply rising hourly wage measure. **********Instead, the index rose only 2.9 percent for the 12 months through March, unchanged from last year's fourth quarter, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. The annual rate  compared with a rise of 2.8 percent in the Consumer Price Index, the best-known inflation measure, for the same period. Wages were up at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, roughly the level that prevailed through 1996. But benefit costs rose 2 percent over the last 12 months, one of the smallest increases in this decade, mostly because of so little movement in employer outlays for health insurance. **********Many Wall Street analysts had argued that employers had run out of ways to hold down health care costs, and the Employment Cost Index for the first quarter, issued yesterday, would reflect the changing circumstance. But it did not. A report issued by the General Accounting Office in February suggested that companies were still cutting back family coverage while the percent of workers covered by company plans had continued to decline. **********''If your company paid $1,000 a year ago for your health insurance,'' said Wayne Shelly, head of the division at the Bureau of Labor Statistics that compiles the Employment Cost Index, ''today it is paying $1,002.'' **********The Employment Cost Index and some other broad measures of wage increases are displaying a distinctive pattern in this seventh year of the recovery. Rather than increases across the board -- the usual pattern as unemployment fell and labor markets tightened in most previous expansions -- the biggest raises are coming at either end of the pay spectrum, with much less for the middle. **********The main beneficiaries in recent months, the data suggest, have been executives and other high-end workers and also the lowest-paid workers. The latter appears to reflect the 50-cents-an-hour increase in the minimum wage last October, to $4.75, as well as a rise in commission payments for salespeople. **********''If you are going to have an inflationary situation brought on by labor costs,'' said Alan Krueger, a Princeton labor economist and a former chief economist at the Labor Department, ''you are going to have to have wages rising for middle-income people and not just at the tails.'' **********Still, Wall Street's preoccupation with inflation could be rekindled before the week is out. Today, the Commerce Department is scheduled to issue its first report on economic growth for the first quarter. Analysts widely expect growth in the nation's gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, to exceed 4 percent, at an annual rate, which many forecasters consider too strong to be sustained without contributing to higher inflation. And on Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report on new job creation and unemployment for April, as well as the latest monthly figure for average hourly pay. **********''What we might do,'' Mr. McKelvey, the Goldman, Sachs economist, said, ''is focus the inflation issue more sharply on what happens to economic growth rather than labor costs.'' **********For Mr. Krueger and some other labor economists, the Employment Cost Index and the median weekly wages for full-time workers -- $504 in the first quarter, up 3 percent in 12 months -- are better indicators of what is happening to wages and who is getting raises than the more popular and more rapidly rising average hourly wage for production workers. The average hourly wage statistic, they say, is distorted by overtime pay, which can drive the average higher, and by problems with the 400,000 companies surveyed to gather this statistic. **********The surveys are done by each state government and the companies they sample are not fully representative. The Labor Department, as a result, is considering changes in the way this survey is carried out. **********Productivity, the measure of how much each worker produces, also plays a role in determining when rising labor costs might force companies to raise prices. If inflation is rising at, say, 2.5 percent a year, and productivity or output is going up at 1 percent a year, as it has been in recent years, then the Employment Cost Index has to rise by more than 3.5 percent a year before employers find themselves under pressure to seek ever larger price increases.

Fiat simply shut its big Mirafiori plant on the edge of this northern Italian industrial city. Last year, though, it kept the plant open to retool for a new sedan, the Marea, and the 40-year-old Mr. Viberti, a logistics specialist, got just two weeks off. This August is a little better. Even though the plant is partly open, he will be off three weeks. **********Mr. Viberti and his colleagues at Fiat are not the only ones who are finding themselves on the job during at least some of the dog days of August. Across Europe, there are signs that the Continent's once-sacred long summer shutdown is gradually going the way of homemade pasta and wine in the lunch pail. **********The change largely reflects the growing emergence of European companies as multinational players. Prodded by the year-round realities of the global economy, many of these companies are finding that they must keep their offices and factories operating all the time, albeit often at a slower pace. It is just one of the changes that companies are trying to make in work rules and production methods to become more competitive on the world stage. **********The shift on summer shutdowns began for the most part with car makers, but has been spreading to other industries, including electronics and food processing, that also have extensive overseas operations. **********''You have to keep producing 12 months of the year,'' said Lamberto Prati, the assistant to the president of Barilla S.p.A., the Italian group that is the world's largest pasta maker. **********Indeed, the move to a working August, while still in its early stages, is beginning to have ripple effects across the Continent. Suppliers are finding that they have to stay open, too, to keep their customers' factories humming. **********The change is also helping to transform the vacation habits of Europeans, who are moving in increasing numbers -- and often happily -- to the American-style approach of taking shorter breaks several times a year, rather than one long summer holiday. And with fewer people away in August, the pace of summer life in many company towns is picking up: instead of pulling up the sidewalks and going on their own vacations, retailers, restaurant owners and others are finding a reason to keep their businesses open. **********To be sure, despite the new pullback, a long summer break still remains a staple for millions of Europeans, as witnessed by the crowds flocking to the beaches of the Cote d'Azur in France and Italy's Adriatic coast, among others. **********Still, the change can be seen almost everywhere. East of here, in Milan, Italy's business and finance capital, the local division of Nestle, the Swiss food giant, is keeping its corporate headquarters open all summer for the first time, ending the practice of sending its 700 employees on vacation in August. In Germany, Volkswagen, which in the past shut its factories for four weeks every summer, is likewise keeping them open for the first time. **********''Everything is changing,'' Mr. Viberti said, on a coffee break between shifts at Fiat. ''Summer is now a hot time, in every sense of the word.'' **********The change is most striking in the automobile industry. Volkswagen executives say the decision to keep the company's five factories open in Germany, which in peak periods employ about 96,000 workers, is part of a strategy to create a ''breathing factory,'' in which production expands and contracts with demand, like an organism. ''Typically, you have more orders in spring, so you need the summer production,'' said Andreas Meurer, a spokesman at Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg, ''while in autumn and winter there are fewer orders. We've got strong demand now.'' **********Instead of sending workers off all at once, Volkswagen now offers a ''vacation corridor'' stretching from late June to late September in which employees can take their vacations. Rather than using the summer shutdown to retool for new models, Volkswagen will do this while production continues, Mr. Meurer said. **********Auto suppliers that never got into the habit of closing in the summer say they are delighted by the car makers' shift to year-round production, which eliminates bumps in demand. The surge that came each year when the auto industry cranked up after its summer break ''is now largely gone,'' said Ingrid Ledertheil, a spokeswoman for Dynamit Nobel Kunststoff G.m.b.H., which makes plastic components like bumpers and dashboards for the leading car makers. **********Production no longer shuts down as it once did at the big plant north of Paris where BASF, the German chemical giant, employs 1,000 people making paints for the auto industry. ''Working conditions have changed,'' said Philippe Krasnopolski, a company officer, who added that the change was forced by new manufacturing techniques. ''It's all just-in-time delivery,'' he said. **********August factory closings are occurring ''less and less in France,'' he said, though the change has not been as sharp in Italy, where BASF factories continue to close in August. **********Maurizio Magnabosco, the head of human resources at Fiat's automobile unit, says globalization is the key that has kept the doors open at his company. Fiat is a major manufacturer in South America, for example. ''Down there, it's winter,'' Mr. Magnabosco said. ''If they're working, we have to work, too.'' **********Fiat's plant near Belo Horizonte in Brazil, with a daily output of 2,600 cars, is one of the world's largest. ''It's inconceivable for that factory to be open and we here to be closed,'' he said. ''The future will move even further in this direction.'' **********As it does, it will continue to reshape the vacation habits of Europeans, many of whom seem ready for a change. ''People no longer want long vacations, but more and shorter breaks,'' said Mr. Magnabosco, a sociologist by training. **********Another change is that families are splitting up for their holidays, he said, and his own is no exception. This month, his son is visiting Ireland while his daughter will vacation in Sardinia. He and his wife will take time off later this month at their summer home on the Cote d'Azur. **********In a circular effect, the changes in vacation habits are fueling summer car sales. This month, Fiat will sell about 100,000 cars in Italy, double the number it sold in August a decade ago, as more Italians stay home and car dealerships stay open. **********Of course, not everyone is part of the movement yet. Broad swaths of European business are continuing to roll up their assembly lines this month. This year, as in years past, the German auto maker BMW closed its big factory in Munich for a month, sending 10,000 workers on vacation. In France, Renault did likewise. So widespread are the closings in France's textile industry, which provides fabric for much of European fashion, that production slumps by two-thirds in August from midwinter levels. **********In European capitals like Paris, Rome and Madrid, thousands of small stores selling everything from neckties to necklaces are closed, their owners happily sitting on Mediterranean beaches. In Rome, the closing is still so complete that newspapers publish lists of food stores that remain open to help those left behind find provisions. **********But not everyone gets to leave town. In nonmanufacturing industries, like tourism, many Europeans work longer in summer than at any time of the year. In Spain, according to estimates by Banco Santander, the largest Spanish bank, the gross domestic product during the peak tourist months of July and August is 15 percent to 20 percent higher than the yearly average. As tourists pour into Spain, bank offices remain open on Sundays to meet the demand for services. **********Even within manufacturing, the extent of summer shutdowns has always varied by industry, with car makers the most willing to close. Among major European car makers, only Mercedes-Benz, the auto division of Daimler-Benz in Germany, has never shut down in summer. With 12 factories throughout Germany, and school vacation times differing in the various regions, Mercedes says it is impossible to close down completely at any one time. **********More in the mainstream was Volkswagen's approach. In the past, at the start of the company's summer hiatus, Volkswagen chartered passenger trains to take thousands of Italian employees from its factories in Wolfsburg to their homes in Italy. Until the practice was dropped in the 1980's, when most workers had cars, the trains dropped off passengers first in northern Italy, then in Rome, and then continued on to southern ports, where the remaining workers boarded ferries to their homes on Sicily and Sardinia. **********Wolfsburg, like Fiat's Turin and other factory centers, became a ghost town as the local merchants pulled down their iron shutters and followed the car workers to the sun. Now, many of these same merchants are vying for business by boasting that they remain open all summer. In July, the big Italian supermarket chain, GS Supermercati, papered the landscape with billboards showing a fashionable young couple behind a shopping cart, and the words ''August -- a month like any other.'' **********European trade unions have generally been defenseless to stem the tide of change. At Fiat, for example, the bitter pill of shorter summer holidays was sweetened by a company pledge to hire more workers. Union resistance was also tempered by the realization that by and large  workers liked the new arrangements.

Juan Domingo Peron, has lost a national election while in charge of the Government. **********The upset will make it difficult for President Carlos Saul Menem, whose Peronist Party lost its majority in the 257-member House of Deputies, to continue the pace of economic and social changes that have been widely applauded for producing fiscal growth and stability. **********It was also the first time that the Peronists, who have governed almost unchallenged since Mr. Menem was elected in 1989 and re-elected in 1995, have lost an election in their stronghold, the province of Buenos Aires, which accounts for about 40 percent of the electorate. **********Pollsters and political analysts said the opposition alliance, which had attacked the Government's failure to address record unemployment and rampant corruption, was well positioned to capture the presidency in 1999. **********''The overriding factor here was people's perception that this Government had been in power for a very, very long time and that it had turned a blind eye to corruption, injustice and unemployment,'' said Felipe Noguera, a political analyst for the polling company Mora, Araujo and Noguera. ''The existence of the alliance was good news for most people because it gave them a choice.'' **********Half the seats in the House of Deputies were at stake in the mid-term elections. With 98 percent of the ballots counted, the federal election board said today that the opposition alliance had won 45.8 percent of ballots cast nationwide, or 61 seats. The alliance is composed of the centrist Radical Party and the center-left Frepaso Party. **********The Peronists won 35.5 percent of the national vote, or 52 seats, losing 13 seats and their majority. The remaining lower house seats were split among minor parties. The Senate, which was not up for re-election, remains in the hands of the Peronists. **********In Buenos Aires province, the opposition captured 48.3 percent of the vote, compared with 41.3 percent for the Peronists. **********At a celebration party in downtown Buenos Aires, the leaders of the opposition alliance stood hand in hand on Sunday night presenting a unified front of victory, amid loud cheers from a large crowd. **********Clearly the heroine of the day was Graciela Fernandez Meijide, a former human rights activist who was the opposition alliance's lead congressional candidate. Mrs. Fernandez Meijide proved very popular with voters in Buenos Aires province, where she campaigned heavily on a platform of stamping out corruption and creating new jobs. **********The Menem Government has been plagued by corruption scandals in recent years, and two months ago,  Argentina's high unemployment rate of 16.1 percent led to violent protests and roadblocks across the country. **********''I want to thank every woman and man in the country who voted, even if they didn't vote for us, because whoever they voted for, they voted for justice, education and work,'' said Mrs. Fernandez Meijide, who acknowledged that she had a hard time believing the alliance had won. **********In a televised message broadcast at 9:30 P.M., President Menem conceded defeat for his party but said ''the most important victory'' of his Government was ''the existence of a strong opposition.'' He said the Peronists ''have put our country back in its rightful place'' and promised to spend his last two years in power governing with ''the same pioneering spirit.'' **********But Carlos Alvarez, a Frepaso leader who is considered the strategist behind the opposition alliance, said: ''The people no longer want a dishonest government. The age of omnipotence and arrogance is over.'' **********Until Sunday's election, Mr. Menem had control over both the Congress through his party majority,  and the judiciary through appointments. **********The biggest losers in Sunday's elections were Gov. Eduardo Duhalde of Buenos Aires and his wife,  Hilda Duhalde, who were chosen to lead the Peronist slate of congressional candidates in Buenos Aires province in direct competition with Mrs. Fernandez Meijide. **********Analysts viewed the contest in the province as a crucial test for Mr. Duhalde's quest to become the Peronist candidate for president in 1999. Mr. Duhalde, Mr. Menem's former Vice President, said that ''the father of this defeat is the Governor'' and that he would wait a few days before commenting on his political future. **********Pollsters said the elections results showed that the Peronists grossly underestimated the importance that voters had placed on issues like unemployment, corruption and a balance of power. Instead, the Peronists tried to scare voters into remaining with their party by painting dire scenarios of economic upheaval if the opposition won. **********''Those threats fell on deaf ears because we made it clear during the campaign that our economic policies would retain the stability that Argentines have enjoyed in recent years,'' said Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini, the secretary of finance for the Buenos Aires city government, which is controlled by the Radicals. **********''One of the most pathetic things a politician can do is to ignore the cries of the people,'' he said.

Schumacher & Company, is starting a campaign in an effort to update its image and compete more effectively against designers like Ralph Lauren and Liz Claiborne. **********The campaign is part of a major transformation of the 74-year-old line, which includes fabric, wallpaper, window treatments, bedding and lamps -- some produced under license. Waverly's president, Christiane Michaels, who came to the company from Westpoint Stevens in September 1996, said her goal was to ''take the wonderful name recognition Waverly had as a fabric resource and make it the premier resource for home decorating.'' **********Ms. Michaels's strategy includes modernizing and broadening product design, seeking out new licensees, redesigning packaging and store displays and increasing the number of Waverly Home stores. There are three such stores in suburban New York; two will open later this month -- in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta -- and another seven are scheduled to open next year. **********To promote these changes, Waverly has replaced Tarlow, Revlon's in-house ad agency, which has outside accounts and has been Waverly's agency for the last four years, with Lotas Minard Patton McIver, and it is more than doubling its advertising budget. Officials said Waverly spent $1.7 million on advertising in 1996 and a minimal amount so far this year; the budget for the new campaign is $4 million. **********The new ads will run either as single pages or in double-  and triple-page spreads starting in February in such home furnishings and life-style magazines as In Style, House & Garden, Home, Bon Appetit, Vanity Fair and People; all but In Style and House & Garden are new for the company. Ads will also appear in trade publications. **********Elegantly photographed by Oberto Gili, who photographs both fashion and home furnishings, the campaign displays two separate Waverly collections, each creating a sophisticated interior for a different room. Most ads feature one of two chic female models, chosen not only to personify each collection, but also to appeal to women, who generate 90 percent of Waverly's sales. The copy stresses the reader's ability to use Waverly products to create a unique environment, emphasizing this again in the tag line, ''Waverly, your interior design.'' Ads also list the various types of home furnishings the company makes. **********''We want to speak to female consumers instead of at them,'' said Daniel Bonini, Waverly's vice president for marketing. ''We want to tell them that they have a choice to decorate however they want to. Their home represents their personality, and Waverly can give them the resources to accomplish their goals.'' **********Waverly also hopes to use its new advertising to attract buyers younger than its traditional 34-to-55-year-old customer base, Ms. Michaels said. **********''We present an alternative to designer names,'' Ms. Michaels said, referring to ever-growing competition from clothing designers like Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Liz Claiborne who are migrating into home furnishings. ''Not everyone wants to decorate their home around a designer name.'' **********This is the second time that Sally Minard, a partner at Lotas Minard Patton McIver, has handled the Waverly account; she also worked on the business in the early 1980's when she was a senior vice president at Lord Geller Federico Einstein. ''It's exactly the right moment to expand Waverly's vision, to let people know it's a resource they can turn to for in-depth help,'' she said. ''There's more opportunity to make it your own.''  Several retailers that sell Waverly products echoed that assessment. **********''If you can show a person something they feel they can do, they can have, and if the product is easily accessible, then the campaign should work,'' said Neil Janovic, vice president of Janovic Plaza, a paint and wall covering merchant in Long Island City, Queens. ''They're showing a person how easy it is to bring all the products they're associated with together. This hasn't really been done before by other leaders in the wall-covering industry.'' **********Evan Cole, president of ABC Carpet and Home, the Manhattan-based home furnishings retailer that also sells Waverly products, said he applauded the company ''for going outside the envelope.'' **********''Taking the fashion point of view is a big move,'' he added. **********Roy Chefets, a senior manager in the retail consulting practice of Coopers & Lybrand, also praised the creative work of the new campaign. ''They're selling Waverly as fashion, with glamorous photographs,'' he said. ''That's how people buy things -- they dream of what they'd like to have. It's probably a fantasy, but it's nice stuff.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/business/c-corrections-644609.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Correction", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Corrections", "print_headline": "Corrections", "body_text": " **********A chart last Sunday about the performance of different types of mutual funds during bear markets omitted the percentage returns of the best- and worst-performing fund groups.

After three devastating hurricanes in the past nine years, local real estate brokers say some owners just cannot face another. **********Prospective buyers also are watching the weather. Hurricanes, like earthquakes and volcanoes, can cause real estate prices to plummet temporarily. Even the prospect of disaster can do it. **********\"There are some good speculative buys right now,\" said Nick Bailey, managing broker at John Foster Real Estate in St. Thomas. **********Of course, most of the best deals are made after the catastrophe. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, for example, many condominiums changed ownership at fire-sale prices following Hurricane Marilyn in 1995. Houses were more robust: Local brokers reported reductions of about between 20 percent and 40 percent on homes worth between $200,000 and $500,000, less on more expensive properties and on undeveloped land. **********One thing seems certain: Return they will. \"People really have very short memories,\" observed Michael Collins, real estate director for Fred Sands in Beverly Hills, California. After a 6.6-point earthquake struck Los Angeles in January 1994, many people fled the area, and prices in Northridge, which is situated at the center of the fault line, came down about 30 percent in six months, Mr. Collins said. \"But they have recovered long since and those opportunities are now gone.\" **********Japanese real estate values appear less aligned to the incidence of natural disaster than in the west, perhaps because all of the country is vulnerable to earthquakes. Prices in Kobe declined after the devastating earthquake three years ago but have since performed in line with those of the country as a whole, real estate analysts at the Tokyo office of Smith Barney said. **********Prices also tend to be more stable in Europe, where Mother Nature appears to have a lighter touch than in Caribbean or Japan.

''I knew Caterpillar was a blue-chip stock, so I didn't hesitate to buy.'' **********Like scores of other investors who hope to reap the rewards of the raging bull market, Mr. Czerepak has been swept up by stock split fever, the bet that once a company splits its stock, the shares will soar. **********Some academic studies have found that share prices do tend to rise on news of a stock split, though there is no clear reason they should: all a split does is take one share worth, say, $100 and turn it into two shares worth $50 each. **********Some analysts suggest that cheaper stocks are more attractive to amateur investors, who drive their prices up; others say a split is a sign that management of a company is confident about its future. Investors who have picked up on such logic from seminars, investing guides and Internet newsletters are rushing out to capitalize on it. **********The boom has created its own mini industry of advisers and seminars as well as paging services like the one Mr. Czerepak uses. And it has contributed to a surge in trading volume at securities exchanges around the country. **********But the frenzy worries some Wall Street observers, who say that stock splits are simply a meaningless division of the stock pie into smaller pieces. They fret that amateur investors are getting swept up in a speculative bubble that is bound to burst, leaving them with big losses. **********''It's a sign of the times,'' said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. ''This is a market in which pretext follows speculation, and the new pretext for speculators is that there are two shares in place of one, and that more is better than less, even though a stock split has no financial value.'' **********Adding to critics' concerns is the way many investors are playing the stock-split game -- by using call options. These options are contracts that give investors the right to buy a stock at a particular price, within a set period. They are relatively inexpensive, compared with equities, and far more volatile. And while a successful options trade can bring an investor big profits, many options become utterly worthless. **********''Of course, it is a fact that this strategy will not work forever,'' Bernard Schaeffer, president of the Investment Research Institute, wrote recently in a bulletin to his customers. He added that it is likely to end ''very, very badly for the latecomers to the game.'' **********Trading in equity options set a record in July, according to the Options Industry Council, and some of it, at least, is attributable to speculation on stock splits. **********For instance, Caterpillar announced on June 11 that it would split its stock a month later. Before the announcement, trading volume in Caterpillar options on the American Stock Exchange had averaged 927 contracts a day; but on the day of the announcement, volume hit 7,693 contracts -- an eightfold rise. **********''It's our feeling that it's happening because there are people out there with pagers,'' said Joseph B. Stefanelli, who oversees options trading at the American Stock Exchange. ''They get a call that says, 'There's been a stock split. Buy Amalgamated Garbage Pails.' '' **********In recent months, the number of investor paging services has proliferated. Among the best known are Splitalert, Splitxpress and the IQ Pager. The services can cost up to $1,500 a year. There is also an Internet site called the Right Line Split Report, which is ''devoted to the short term dramatic investment profitability of companies who have declared stock splits.'' **********Trading options, ''particularly on the split announcements, is probably the biggest thing going on Wall Street right now,'' said Kevin Tuohy, chief operating officer at Data Research Group, which runs Splitalert. **********Anthony LaPine, the chief executive at Datalink Systems, an electronic-paging company, said that in recent months Datalink received scores of calls asking for a stock-split service. In response, his company created the Splitxpress pager, which already has several hundred subscribers. He said, ''I'm led to believe that a lot of the history derives from people like Wade Cook.'' **********Indeed, the name Wade B. Cook came up repeatedly in interviews with those who use stock split pagers. Mr. Cook is an evangelizing investment guru who spreads his word through seminars, tapes and best-selling books. He is also under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for securities fraud, according to documents his company, the Profit Financial Corporation, filed with the agency. Mr. Cook has denied any wrongdoing. **********In a recent book, ''Wall Street Money Machine,'' Mr. Cook -- a former cab driver whose proverbs include ''God wants us to prosper'' -- has an entire chapter devoted to buying options on stock splits. He also has an Internet site that, among other things, markets his IQ Pager. And a growing number of investors are taking his advice. **********For instance, Edward Iskra of Clifton, N.J., a computer consultant, said that although trading on stock splits can be risky, he has done very well. ''I can't say I've made a mint off of it, but the returns on investment I've gotten are large versus the market.'' **********But even Mr. Cook thinks things may have gotten a little out of hand. ''Options are just the latest craze,'' he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday, adding that no more than 5 percent of investors are sophisticated enough to make what he allows can be risky trades. **********Still, earlier that day, he said, he was attending a meeting at an investment bank when his beeper sounded. Ingersoll-Rand had announced a 3-for-2 split. He tried to buy options, he said, ''but we didn't get in there in time.'' He settled for buying 1,000 shares of stock. **********It's a fast-moving market, even for those with beepers; just ask Mr. Czerepak, the law-enforcement official who had phoned his broker to buy options on Caterpillar. After less than a half-hour, Mr. Czerepak placed another call to his broker, only to find that the price of the options he owned had already risen substantially. He quickly sold them. **********''I got a hot one, and got out and made a nice profit in 20 minutes,'' he said.

Analysts said the three-day selloff was provoked by a currency run in the Philippines on Friday and fears that the Brazilian currency could come under devaluation pressures. **********The Bovespa index of the 47 most active shares on the Sao Paulo exchange plummeted 1,081 points, to 11,617, in its steepest decline in nearly two and a half years. The drop, following declines of 3.3 percent Friday and 3.4 percent Monday, also dragged down markets in Mexico, Argentina and other Latin American countries. **********The declines were steepest in companies that had been the motor of the Bovespa's stunning 93 percent run-up this year before Friday. Most notable among them were Telebras, the telecommunications holding company whose stock had more than doubled this year, and Electrobras, the electrical utility. **********''The market here had a propensity to fall, and it was looking for a reason,'' said Maria Amalia Coutrim of Opportunity, an asset management company in Rio de Janeiro. Because the correction is so quick and steep, it could prove brief, she said, but she added that additional minor corrections would not surprise her. **********Analysts in Rio said that talk of a correction had been in the air in recent weeks, so a selloff was easily ignited. Geoffrey Dennis -- the strategist in emerging markets for HSBC James Capel, which had cautioned in mid-June that Brazil's market was ''vulnerable to bad news'' -- said in a phone interview from London today that talk of a devaluation was a wild card that could make the correction more serious than originally foreseen. **********''Whether this turns into a major crash very much depends on whether it turns into a currency crisis,'' he said. ''If this is just profit taking against a background of high prices, it will blow itself out relatively quickly and people should start buying back relatively soon. If it turns into a currency crisis, the market will have significant downside,'' with declines of 30 to 50 percent. **********Mr. Dennis said the ''currency contagion'' that forced Thailand to float its currency on July 2, with the Philippines following on Friday and Malaysia on Monday, could exert pressure for a devaluation in Brazil, though he put the odds of a move at ''less than 50-50.'' **********The analyst said part of the reason he believed Brazil might avoid a crisis was the country's $59 billion in foreign reserves. Also, because the Brazilian currency, the real, moves within an exchange rate band that gradually decreases its value by 7 percent a year, the Government has the flexibility to speed up the adjustment without floating the currency. **********Perhaps most important, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, whose political popularity is based on his success in slaying hyperinflation, is likely to do everything feasible to avoid a large devaluation that could lead to inflationary pressures and a loss of investor confidence as he mounts his re-election campaign.  The real is now worth $1.07 -- down 7 percent in the last 12 months. **********John Mullin, Latin American equity strategist for Salomon Brothers, said the fundamentals that had made Brazil an attractive investment market would still be there after a correction. Those factors include a huge, modernizing economy with pent-up internal demand in areas like telecommunications and, thus, plenty of room for growth. **********Such considerations made Brazilian stocks one of the best buys of the first half of 1997. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Index, which covers a broader basket of stocks than the Bovespa index, shows the Brazilian market with a rise of 60.3 percent this year through Friday, the world's third-best performance, after Russian stocks, which soared 151 percent, and Turkish stocks, up 60.5 percent. Elsewhere, stocks rose 59.4 percent in Hungary; 41.5 percent in Mexico; 38.7 percent in India; 31.6 percent in Taiwan; 12.2 percent in Korea; 7 percent in Hong Kong, and 2 percent in Indonesia. Thai stocks were an exception, plunging 32 percent. In the United States, leading  stock indexes rose about 23 percent over the period. **********In Brazil, industrial growth from January to May was up to 5 percent, towering over the 1.4 percent growth for all of 1996. ''Any selloff will be contained,'' Mr. Mullin predicted. **********But perhaps Salomon has been too optimistic. At the start of trading today, the firm advised buying Ericsson Telecomunicacoes. The company, a maker of telecommunications equipment affiliated with Ericsson of Sweden, had fallen by 22 percent since Friday; by day's end, it was down another 10 percent. **********A handful of Brazilian companies, like Aracruz Cellulose, Brahma, Telebras and Electrobras, trade as American depository receipts on the New York Stock Exchange. Buyers of the A.D.R.'s of Telebras, for example, paid $48 when they were first listed on the Big Board in November 1995 and have done quite well for themselves; the A.D.R.'s peaked at $169.25 last Wednesday. Today, they fell $11.25, to $135. **********But most Brazilian stocks can be acquired only by institutional investors or investors with accounts in Brazil -- and analysts warn that some of these can take time to sell. Some analysts here, like Ms. Coutrim, expect foreign investors to cash in some Brazilian holdings while they can still make a profit and move their money to Mexico. **********''In terms of fresh money, we think Mexico is more appealing than Brazil, and expect it to be the leadership for the rest of the year,'' said Jay Pelosky, Morgan Stanley's Latin American strategist. **********While the firm remains impressed with Brazil, and is interested in the second tier of closely held companies, the Mexican market promises more growth now, he said. **********Morgan Stanley just raised its forecasts for economic growth in Mexico this year to 5.2 percent from 4.3 percent. Mr. Pelosky also said the recent elections there were encouraging.

Take Iraq, she said, ''That could affect us in a real hurry.'' **********In Seattle, Greg Lulay, waiting for a bus in front of Kinko's on Broadway, said he was all for paying America's debt to the United Nations not only to support the United Nations and its views of what should be done in the world ''but as an example to other nations.'' **********In Harlington, Tex., Tom Kimbriel, a police sergeant, wants to see the United States become a stronger player in international affairs. ''We were granted the power, and its our responsibility to see that the neighborhood bully doesn't take on the kid with the glasses,'' he said. ''To argue that what goes on in other countries doesn't affect the United States is very childish. Just look at what we pay for a barrel of oil.'' **********Around the United States, an informal sampling of the attitudes of people far from the centers of foreign policy-making tends to support what some public-opinion researchers have been finding: That although a declining number of Americans say they follow foreign affairs, this might be a question of definition. Actually, the researchers are finding, even ordinary Americans who ignore many military or political developments in remote parts of the world are very interested in other international issues that they believe directly affect their lives. **********Those include immigration and trade negotiations that could have an effect on their jobs or taxes, environmental issues like global warming, health threats, and drug-trafficking and other cross-border crime. They are less likely to include foreign political or military developments. **********The researchers are also finding a persistent or even widening gap between the opinions of the general public and those of the people who make, think or write about foreign policy. **********For example, the general public seems to support the United Nations and United States cooperation with other countries in times of crisis -- rather than solitary action by Washington playing the role of the world's police force. That attitude differs markedly from those of opinion leaders and policy-makers, especially in Congress. **********Two polls this fall -- one by the Washington-based Pew Research Center for the People and the Press (formerly the Times Mirror Center) and the other by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes reached different conclusions about the level of public interest in international events. The Pew poll concluded that Americans did not see events abroad having great effect on their lives. Polls by the University of Maryland have shown greater public concern. Both, though, found gaps between the general public's perceptions and those of opinion leaders. **********The Pew poll -- which sampled foreign-affairs experts, journalists, scholars, scientists, religious leaders, governors, mayors, Congressional aides, business executives and labor leaders and measured their views against those of the general public -- found that ''American opinion leaders see the world as a better place, where U.S. influence is enhanced.'' **********''In striking contrast,'' the poll report said, ''the American public's global view remains bleak.'' The report, ''American's Place in the World II,'' finds that opinion leaders are more assertive about American power. Only 27 percent of those polled preferred to see the United States share power equally with other major countries. But 50 percent of members of the general public polled favored an equal spread of power. **********At the independent United Nations Association of the United States, Jeffrey Laurenti, executive director of policy studies, said that this gap has been apparent for some time. A poll his organization commissioned after the 1995 Dayton peace accords, which ended the fighting in Bosnia --  when leading policy-makers were heaping abuse on the United Nations in Bosnia and had agreed on the intervention of NATO -- indicated that ''by far the largest segment plunked down for a U.N. peacekeeping force with American troops rather than a NATO operation or no response at all.'' **********In the 1997 University of Maryland survey, 74 percent of those polled said they wanted the United States to share power internationally, compared with 13 percent who prefer a pre-eminent American role in the world. **********''Support for the U.N. is higher than support for NATO,'' said Steven Kull, director of the Maryland Program on International Policy Attitudes. **********Mr. Kull believes that those in  power frequently underrate, misjudge or misuse public opinion. **********''Something the policy-makers do not understand is how idealistic the public still is,'' he said. ''When a member of Congress says, ''I'm an internationalist, I'm supportive, but my public doesn't understand it so I have to go along with them -- that is a misperception.'' **********How foreign affairs are defined makes a difference, researchers say. **********The Maryland poll, and independent polling done for the United Nations Association, a private research and support group with chapters around the country, have found that Americans are less moved by abstract concepts like ''national interests'' -- a phrase often used by those in power -- and want more attention given to global social and humanitarian issues that they might not always  describe as ''foreign affairs.'' **********Surveys find a high level of public interest in environmental destruction, health menaces that cross borders, illegal drugs, international crime and the loss of jobs to low-wage countries. **********With Congress in Washington on the verge of bankrupting the United Nations by withholding $1.5 billion in overdue assessments -- or even withdrawing from it, a measure that garnered 54 votes in the House this year, though 369 voted against it -- polls indicate that the American public has significantly more support for  the United Nations than does Congress. **********Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew center, whose poll found less concern about foreign affairs than other polls have indicated, nonetheless agrees that Americans are not hostile to the United Nations. **********''I think there is a really strong base of support for the U.N.,'' he said in an interview. In his latest poll, 64 percent of Americans polled -- opinion leaders and the general public combined -- gave the United Nations a favorable rating, although this has slipped from 74 percent in 1993, two years after the end of the Persian Gulf war. **********''Public interest in international news stories has plummeted over a decade,'' said Mr. Kohut, with the percentage of people who said they followed foreign news dropping from 80 percent in the 1980's to 20 percent in 1997. The decline was most precipitous among young people, he said. But he added that opinion surveys find that what turns them off are traditional categories of foreign news as international politics, security, war and peace. **********Mr. Kohut says that news organizations bear a share of the responsibility for driving people away. Most people receive foreign news from  television, which is carrying less of it, and what there is may be largely pictorial or pitched to strategic or military issues. **********''As the news hole for international news shrinks,'' he said, ''the proportion of conflict-driven stories increases. People say, 'How can one keep all these wars straight?' '' **********''If you look at what American people say are high priority issues to them with regard to foreign policy, it is consistently those things which have some apparent or clear relevance to their lives,'' he said. ''Jobs comes up to the top of the list. The spread of nuclear weapons is very high -- the only traditional security problem that's way up there. **********''Things like combating international drug-trafficking, insuring an adequate energy supply, improving the global environment -- these are issues that people feel affect not only the country, but affect them in their communities,'' Mr. Kohut said. **********''They have a hard time dealing with issues like 'What is the relevance of failed states, in Africa, in Bosnia?' '' he said. ''But when the American public sees the relevance of an issue such as global environmental concerns or nuclear proliferation, they are as engaged as the members of the Council on Foreign Relations.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/12/business/key-rates-042129.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-03-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/21/business/digerati-are-unlikely-celebrants-primitivist-conflagration-nevada-desert.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Rothstein", "pub_date": "1997-07-21", "snippet": "Annual Burning Man festival will be held in Nevada's Black Rock Desert on Labor Day weekend; festival is paean to state of being that can be found in precincts of cyberspace, which libertarian celebrants hail for its invented identities in multi-u...", "word_count": 989, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Digerati are unlikely celebrants of a primitivist conflagration in the Nevada desert.", "print_headline": "Digerati are unlikely celebrants of a primitivist conflagration in the Nevada desert.", "body_text": " **********A NAKED couple poses on the baked desert plain, wearing black net face masks, goggles and snorkels. A bald man in blue lipstick wears a baby dress and carries a pinwheel. A man squats in ersatz tribal gear complete with a stick through his nose. Celebrants like these have come to a five-day festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert that takes place annually on Labor Day weekend with 115-degree temperatures, parched earth and ritualistic spectacle (last year about 10,000 people arrived). **********At their center is a five-story high statue of a man, constructed of wood and lighted with neon. On the final night, the statue is set ablaze as celebrants dance in painted skin and loincloths and scream in ecstasy. **********The festival is called Burning Man and in preparation for this summer it is being commemorated in a new book containing devotional essays and photos of elaborate revelry. But despite the mock primitivism of the festival, the book is being published by Hardwired, a label usually more preoccupied with Web-ites than Luddites. And the festival itself has a promotional and inspirational World Wide Web site that is heating up in anticipation of this year's event (http://www.burningman.com). In fact, the Internet seems an unusually comfortable home for Burning Man devotees. Anthologies of sites (http:/ /www.yahoo.com/regional/u-s-states/nevada/art/burning-man-festival) have been posted; regular participants in the festival provide links to photos and archives (http:// www.nepenthes.com/Burning/burning.html) and the eyewitness accounts are provided by the alternative press (http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996/091296/news1.html) as well as mainstream newspapers (http://www.sjmercury.com/west/ brnmn929.htm). **********What's going on here? After all, primal screams are usually prompted by something other than the hunger for more bandwidth, and cultic conflagrations seem to have little to do with the languages of programming like HTML and Java. Yet the association is unmistakable. Kevin Kelly, a founder of Wired magazine, has called Burning Man ''the holiday of choice for the digerati.'' Among its motorcycle freaks, urban dropouts and thrill seekers, are media professionals and technology cultists. **********Is this a form of technological slumming? An escape from venture capitalists? A novel approach to  brainstorming? **********Atavistic reactions to new technologies are not that unusual. And sometimes they seem to be in homage to otherworldly forces like the ones summoned by advanced technology. As Arthur C. Clarke once famously put it, any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic. Technology worship can become a form of religion. **********Some of that is surely latent in contemporary cyber-devotion; it even seeps into another book about technological communities, ''A World's Fair,'' coming in September from the MIT Press, in which Carl Malamud gives an account of his creation of an Internet-based international exhibition of sites in 1996. He reminds us of the technological temple of the first World Exhibition in London in 1851: the Crystal Palace, an extraordinary invention, covered with the largest roof ever built, its 293,655 panes of glass revealing a massive assemblage of every machine ever invented. **********Now technology worship may just be taking a slightly weirder form. One cannot look at the costumes in the new book, the painted bodies, or the elaborately bedecked cars with their Mad Max design, without thinking of machinery. People are on display, showing what they can make of themselves, proclaiming their liberation from constraints, declaring a new kind of social technology in which anything can be done or made. Technology has been displaced from metal to flesh; perhaps it is even celebrated in flame. **********This was not the original intention. The festival began in 1986 when Larry Harvey, the Burning Man impresario, held a miniature gathering on a California beach to burn a human effigy. In following years, word got around, crowds accumulated, fire marshals got upset and the festival migrated to the remote desert, where each year attendance has more than doubled. **********In the desert, the impromptu festival became a full-scale countercultural declaration of independence. ''The essence of the desert,'' says Mr. Harvey, ''is that you are free to create your own world, your own visionary reality.'' It provided a social blank slate. Mr. Kelly finds a ''deep parallel between desert and cyberspace.'' **********That idea has had much resonance. This is not really a festival like Woodstock, which was partly a Romantic paean to the natural world. At Burning Man, nature is an opponent, with unforgiving windstorms, dust, lightning, heat and drought. The festival's Web site almost boasts of the spiked branches, snakes and quicksand. Instead the paean is to technological artifice and invented identities. The paean, in fact, is to a state of being that can be found in the precincts of cyberspace, which libertarian celebrants hail for its invented identities in multi-user domains, or M.U.D.'s, and chat rooms, its sexual license and lack of restrictions, its virtual communities and fantasy games. In Mr. Harvey's words, ''Both Burning Man and the Internet make it possible to regather the tribe of mankind.'' **********Perhaps. But there also may be opposing forces at work in Burning Man; this homage is also a rejection. Technology may be celebrated, but Mr. Harvey hints that Burning Man also satisfies a religious desire that technology cannot sate. Burning Man helps reveal technology's limits. It may even be partly an exorcism. The Burning Man is Technological Man, worshiped and destroyed, a robot demolished by its masters before being rebuilt again. **********This year, the festival itself will also start to reveal the limitations it once denied. With the prospect of more than 10,000 celebrants, Mr. Harvey writes on his Web site, ''it's time to assume more responsibility for what we are.'' A ''higher level of commitment'' from participants is needed. Admission will be $75 and the celebration will be held on private property. Speeding cars will be controlled. A fee will be charged to limit access to the local hot springs. **********The libertarian spirit, organizers promise, will remain intact. But it may be that at Burning Man, as in  cyberspace, and as with technology, limitations are inseparable from possibilities, absolute freedom is an illusion, and there is never a blank slate even in the desert."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/30/business/europe-questions-spanish-tv-law.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-06-30", "snippet": "European Commission declares that Spanish Government has no legal right to pass law that essentially outlaws satellite digital television service owned by Madrid-based Grupo Prisa and Canal Plus of France; Spanish Government had organized rival co...", "word_count": 213, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Europe Questions Spanish TV Law", "print_headline": "Europe Questions Spanish TV Law", "body_text": " **********The European Commission dealt a blow to the Spanish Government last week, declaring that it had no legal right to pass a law that essentially outlawed a satellite digital television service owned by Madrid-based Grupo Prisa and Canal Plus of France. **********The ruling is a significant turning point in one of the nastiest political battles over advanced television in Europe.

But the most alarming reaction came when Turkey -- the protector of the Turkish part of the island -- said it would react militarily if the sophisticated S-300 missiles were deployed. **********Despite a hurried tour by a top United States diplomat, and pledges by the Government that it would wait 16 months before receiving any missile components, the mood remains uneasy.

''And the message that they drive home is that the status quo here is unstable, untenable -- and, unless it is fixed, it is going to get worse.'' **********Some political analysts worry that stoking tensions was in fact the aim of the Greek Cypriot Government, an indication of its increasing impatience with efforts to resolve a standoff that has existed since 1974. In that year Turkish troops, reacting to a coup on Cyprus engineered by the Greek junta, invaded the island and partitioned its northern third with 35,000 troops. **********Today the Greek Cypriot population makes up 78 percent of the 730,000 residents.

Michaelides. ''What has happened in the last year is a fear that the situation in Cyprus could become explosive,'' he said, adding that with the missile system, the Government, aided by Greece, could defend itself. **********Few share this view, noting instead that arming Cyprus with such missiles is mainly a challenge to Turkey. More important, the Greek Cypriots have raised the old fear of Greek dominance that has plagued Cyprus since its independence from Britain in 1960. **********''The missiles were a big mistake,'' said Mustafa Akinci, leader of the Communal Liberation Party, a small leftist party on the Turkish side. ''We wanted to hope that the leaders would sit down and find a solution to the Cyprus problem. But you can't find it with an arms race.'' **********Despite last summer's violence along the 110-mile buffer zone, when Turkish border guards killed two Greek Cypriot demonstrators, there were hopes that Greek and Turkish Cypriots could be persuaded to start the kind of intense negotiations that have brought political settlements in the Middle East. **********A key element is the approaching deadline for talks with the European Union over the admission of Cyprus as an associate member. These talks, which are to start early next year, require a resolution of Cyprus's future -- either as a federated country or as two states, forever divided by a tenuous peace. **********The Turkish Cypriot president, Rauf Denktash, has objected strenuously to the Greek Cypriots' efforts to join the European Union.

J. Soedradjat Djiwandono, governor of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, talked in Hong Kong about the lessons of the crisis and his plans to beef up his country's banking supervision with Alan Friedman of the International Herald Tribune. **********Q. Since Thailand faced its crisis in the summer, your own currency has also suffered along with those of neighboring nations, and investor confidence has been shattered. What are the lessons of the financial turmoil? **********A. First of all, we realized that we are really living in the globalized economy. Before, we had only talked about it, but now it is here. When you accept the benefits of globalization, you take it for granted. Yet we only realized the risks of crisis when it happened. When you are hit by crisis it can be indiscriminate, and there is contagion. **********Maybe we in the region have all been a little bit prodigal, living beyond our means. The other lesson from what has happened is that everyone can see that economic growth cannot be sustained unless the banking sector is also sound. **********Q. Is it fair to put Indonesia in the same category with Thailand? **********A. We are all Asian neighbors, and we want to follow a good-neighbor policy. **********Q. All right, let's talk about a neighbor. Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad has been attacking currency speculators as \"rogues\" and \"criminals,\" and he has attacked George Soros in particular for the region's problems. Do you agree with the Malaysian prime minister's views? **********A. I don't really know who was behind the speculation, but it doesn't matter who triggers it. **********Once it happens, the players come from a variety of places, including local corporate groups that have high offshore-loan exposure and need foreign exchange to import and who sell the rupiah. There are also foreign speculators. We cannot say if the problems came from domestic or international sources. **********Q. So you wouldn't describe currency speculators as criminals? **********A. No. **********Q. There has been much talk in Bangkok and here in Hong Kong about the idea of setting up a new ASEAN rescue fund in case of financial crises. Are you in favor of this idea? **********A. This is in a preliminary stage of discussion, and in my view, surveillance would have to be part of it. You cannot just put money in without conditionality. **********Q. Your country has been praised by investors for a more market-oriented response to the crisis than Thailand's. You removed limits on majority ownership of shares by foreign investors, and you have let your currency, the rupiah, float. But Indonesia is also criticized for having let its banking system grow much too fast. How do you react to the criticism? **********A. It is true that we have so many banks, some 239 of them, which in terms of total numbers means Indonesia is overbanked. But our country is very big, and so when you look at the spread of our country, we are not overbanked. **********Q. But what steps are you taking to improve the banking system? **********A. We are making efforts on supervision. We are increasing the number of supervisory personnel. We are trying to follow the internationally accepted capital-adequacy ratios, and we want to increase it. If banks cannot meet this or reserve requirements, then they will have to be merged or acquired. **********Q. What about problem loans? How big are they? **********A. Our bad debts and nonperforming loans total 9 trillion rupiah, or around $3.3 billion, about 9 percent of total lending. **********Q. But some banks have much bigger problems than 9 percent. What do you propose to do? **********A. They will have to be merged, and if necessary in some cases we will have to liquidate some banks. **********Q. And what are your aims in the coming weeks and months? **********A. When the trouble started, we raised our one-month interest rates from 14 percent to as high as 30 percent. Now they are back to 24 percent, and we have plans to reduce rates further, toward a level of around 17 or 18 percent. We also have imposed some restrictions on foreign exchange trading, and we hope these measures will be only temporary. **********Q. There have been reports that one of your deputies treated foreign banks such as the Bank of America and Deutsche Bank very harshly, asking Deutsche Bank to stop engaging in swap deals and telling Bank of America to stop making a market in currencies out of Jakarta. What is your comment? **********A. I think this is bizarre reporting. The fact that we asked foreign banks to come in and meet with us is part of our practice.

''We are really oriented toward technology,'' he said. ''But Bandai has logistics power and marketing power. They are very good at developing cute merchandise. The low-tech and high-tech combination is very good.'' **********The two companies, he said, would combine distribution to save money. Bandai, which is Japan's largest toy company and third in the world behind Mattel and Hasbro, can help make toys of Sega characters like Sonic the Hedgehog while Sega could make games of Bandai characters. **********But some said they did not see the logic behind the merger. ''I am surprised,'' said Nobuyuki Idei, president of the Sony Corporation, which has had its own bad experience with mergers as it tried to become an entertainment company. ''I still cannot find a reason'' they decided to merge, he said. **********Reinier Dobbelmann, an analyst with SBC Warburg Securities in Tokyo, said merging would not solve Bandai's and Sega's problems. ''The overall strategic picture stays doubtful,'' he said. ''There are theoretical synergies, but execution counts. And both companies have big ideas, but they don't carry them out.'' **********Under the agreement, announced today after the market closed here, Sega stockholders will receive 0.76 share of Sega Bandai for each share they own. Bandai stockholders will receive one share of the new company for each Bandai share they own. **********Bandai closed today at 2,560 yen, up 200 yen; Sega closed at 3,660, down 60. At those prices, the merger is worth roughly 129 billion yen -- a little more than $1 billion. **********Makoto Yamashina, president of Bandai, will become president of the new company. Mr. Nakayama of Sega will be vice chairman and chief executive. The chairman will be Isao Ohkawa, current chairman of Sega and head of the CSK Corporation, a Japanese software company that owns 20 percent of Sega. **********Sega's 32-bit video-game machine, the Saturn, is being outsold by the Sony Playstation and by the new Nintendo 64. Sega has been losing money on its home video-game business and making up for it with profit from video arcades. **********Late last month, Sega forecast that its net profit for the fiscal year ending in March would be 5.3 billion yen, or about $45 million, instead of the 10 billion yen it had been projecting. **********Bandai has specialized in licensing the rights to make toys, candy and other goods based on television cartoon characters. Its revenue is above $2 billion. Last week, it said it would have a net loss of 9 billion yen, or about $75 million, in the fiscal year that ends in March, instead of the profit of 10 billion yen it had been forecasting. Sales are expected to be 200 billion yen, or $1.7 billion, instead of the previously forecast 270 billion yen."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/18/world/despite-crackdown-islamic-group-keeps-killing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-11-18", "snippet": "Islamic Group, believed responsible for killing scores of tourists at temple in Luxor, remains Egypt's most active Islamic fundamentalist organization, despite years of harsh Government repression and imprisonment of 15,000 sympathizers and top le...", "word_count": 685, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Despite Crackdown, Islamic Group Keeps Killing", "print_headline": "Despite Crackdown, Islamic Group Keeps Killing", "body_text": " **********Even after years of harsh Government repression, even with 15,000 sympathizers imprisoned and its top leaders in jail, exile or both, the militant movement thought to have killed scores of foreign tourists in Luxor remains  Egypt's most active Islamic fundamentalist organization. **********In recent months, the Egyptian Government has been claiming success at bringing the Islamic Group --  Al Gamaa al Islamiya in Arabic --  under tighter control. **********But that is not the same thing as eradicating it. Instead, the struggle seems to have merely transformed the Islamic Group from a highly disciplined organization that assassinated Anwar el-Sadat in 1981 into a far more loosely knit group of cells. **********While these cells have become less and less effective in Egypt's cities, today's attack shows that they are still able to wreak havoc in sporadic attacks on tourists or in the countryside. **********The damage this can do to a country where poverty is deep and tourism is enormously important was evident in the shock expressed here today by Mamdouh el-Beltagui, Egypt's Tourism Minister. Here for the first day of the London Travel Fair, a major event for tourist operators, he found himself unable to boast that Egypt had conquered terrorism and its threat to travelers. **********''I can't predict at this stage what is going to happen about tourism to the country,'' Mr. Beltagui said. **********In Egypt, Nabil Osman, the Government's spokesman, said, ''We have never said we stopped these groups but that we had contained them.'' He added that terrorism was ''an international phenomenon.'' **********What he did not say was that Egypt had largely succeeded in recapturing an enormous flow of tourism, which had sharply fallen in 1993 and 1994 during a previous wave of  attacks on tourists, and now will probably have to start again. **********The Islamic Group was founded in the late 1970's by a band of radical Muslim theologians, led by Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, and former army intelligence officers and lawyers. The sheik was later exiled and is now serving a life prison sentence in New York for his role in inspiring the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center; the former army officers and lawyers are all now serving life sentences in Egypt. **********The group's most spectacular attack was the assassination of President Sadat while he was reviewing a military parade in 1981, and in subsequent years it staged attacks on prime ministers, cabinet ministers, ranking police officers, secularists and intellectuals, including the Nobel literature laureate Naguib Mahfouz, who was stabbed in an assassination attempt in 1994, when he was 82. **********In the last five years, however, its status and tactics have changed.  President Hosni Mubarak and a succession of interior ministers have claimed, with some justification, to have broken the framework in which  fundamentalist terror had operated in Egypt. This was accomplished  with a ruthless and highly effective security campaign, and with a diplomatic offensive that cut off funds for the militants from rich supporters in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. **********Egyptian officials estimate that the movement now has at most a few hundred operatives, who are hounded by security forces. Having been chased out of big cities, they typically hide out now in a few villages and towns in southern Egypt. Their targets tend to be foreign tourists or the largely defenseless 10 percent of Egyptians who are Christians. **********The attacks on tourists are a  threat to Egypt because of its economic vulnerability; the tourist industry brings in a desperately needed $3 billion a year. Beyond that, the Islamic Group's very survival  erodes Egypt's efforts to portray itself as a dominant Arab nation with a future based on democracy and economic ties to the wider world. **********Today's attack came after the top six jailed leaders of the Islamic Group made repeated appeals, starting in July, for a cessation of violence  ''for the sake of Islam and Muslims.'' **********They seem to have concluded that the battle to convert society by force has been lost, even though the basic political environment in which they recruit converts remains the same:  the Government resists democratization while endemic corruption and vast disparities of wealth continue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/03/business/people.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 272, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "People", "body_text": " *********** Ellen Moran, managing partner at the Omaha office of Bozell Worldwide, part of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt, was promoted to general manager, succeeding Tim Sickinger, executive vice president and general manager, who retires at the end of the month. *********** Bruno Asselin, senior vice president and marketing director at Arnell Group Brand Consulting, New York, was promoted to the new position of president.

AEA has agreed to keep the division's main plant in Corning, N.Y.; to honor its contract with Local 1000 of the American Flint Glass Workers Union, and to retain the division's management. **********Corning's decision to sell the housewares business was no surprise. The company has for the last few years been focusing more and more on high-technology businesses like photonics -- the lasers, amplifiers and other equipment that blast signals down the fiber optic pipelines of modern telecommunications. It announced in May that it wanted to sell the housewares operation, so that it could raise more cash to pump into photonics research and acquisitions. **********Still, most analysts had expected that the Newell Company, Rubbermaid or another housewares company would be the likely buyers. And, most expected Corning Consumer Products, with annual sales around $630 million, to fetch no more than $650 million. **********''When I heard $975 million I couldn't believe it, it was so much more than anyone expected,'' said Andrew Sutphin, an analyst at NatWest. **********Vincent Mai, AEA's chief executive, did not return several calls yesterday. **********Van C. Campbell, Corning's vice chairman, said that Corning would use the cash it is getting to pay down debt and expand its high-purity fused silica business -- which makes materials used in the manufacture of space shuttle windows, telescopes and semiconductors -- as well as to expand its photonics businesses. He added that the decision to sell to AEA, not a housewares company, was purely financial. ''They came up with the best bid,'' he said. **********Investors seem pleased with Corning's strategy. The company's stock, which was mired in the low $30's last fall, has been trading in the $60's for several months now. Before the deal was announced yesterday, the stock had been trading down about $3 from Tuesday's close, a drop analysts attributed to factors like profit taking rather than disillusionment with the company. After the AEA deal was announced, the stock bounced back somewhat, closing at $59.375, down $1.625. **********''The company is now going to trade at the high multiples of a telecommunications company, not the low ones of a pie plate company,'' Mr. Sutphin said. **********For those managers and workers who will stay with the consumer products company, being sold to a financial investor might be seen as a mixed blessing. The business must now build its own financial support staff, and provide other services it had always received from Corning -- and would presumably have received from a buyer like Newell, which makes Anchor Hocking glassware and Miro cookware. Corning has agreed to continue handling accounts payable and other functions for a few years. **********But on the positive side, a financial buyer rarely meddles much in the operational side of a working business. And, after a couple of years of painful cost-cutting, Corning's consumer products division has been quite profitable. ''Another housewares company would have its own ideas about how to run the business, and their own people to carry them out,'' said Peter F. Campanella, who is now, and will remain, the consumer products company's chief executive. **********Unionized workers, too, are sorting out the pros and cons. ''Right now I'm not worried,'' said Stephen A. Mandell Sr., president of Local 1000, which has more than 400 members in the housewares plant. Still, he says that he will feel more comfortable after he has learned more about the new buyers. ''Sure I'm worried that this is a financial investor,'' he said. ''I've heard too many horror stories about financial outfits that buy a business, milk it, and bingo, they're gone.'' **********Actually, AEA consists of investors whose personal backgrounds suggest that they are not purely financial players. The firm was formed in 1969 by retired chief executives of such Fortune 500 companies as General Electric, Ford and Chrysler, all of whom spent their careers deeply involved in the operations of those companies. **********''These are not the types of people to milk businesses,'' Mr. Campanella said. ''They're the type that I can bounce ideas off.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/09/business/diary-992429.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-03-09", "snippet": "Diary of business events of week ended Mar 9; graph; photos; drawing (M)\u00ff", "word_count": 1225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIARY", "print_headline": "DIARY", "body_text": " **********BERLITZ ECONOMICS **********Translating Greenspan **********Biblical scholars have it easy: all they have to do is debate nuances in the ancient Greek. Trying to make sense of today's economy is a far tougher task: you have to figure out what Alan Greenspan is saying. The week before last, according to some highly reliable translations, he said stock prices were too high, and prices dutifully slipped for a few days. Last week, though, he said, ''There is a valid argument as to sustaining the level of prices,'' which some dusty Greenspan scholars translated as ''never mind.'' Stocks dutifully rose nearly 100 points. It's still never entirely clear what he means, though, so maybe the answer would be to translate everything he says to ancient Greek, then back again. **********EMPLOYMENT **********Little Snow, Lots of Jobs **********When the Northeast and other parts of the country practically skip winter, as they did this year, it does wonders for the construction industry, which added 109,000 jobs in February. That was the driving force in an overall gain of 339,000 jobs in the month, the biggest increase in nine months, which helped push the nation's unemployment rate down to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent. Uh-oh, you say -- the economy's overheating, inflation's headed back, stocks will crumble. But the market didn't plunge, because of another point in Friday's job report: companies are not exactly spreading the wealth, with hourly earnings up a measly 3 cents. Can't buy much inflation with that. **********PATRIOT GAMES **********The Pajamas Are Coming! **********Say you're 11, and your mother sends you to buy chewing gum, vowing punishment if you balk. Your father, though, vowed to punish you if he ever caught you buying gum. What to do? That's roughly the position Wal-Mart found itself in recently in Canada, but it wasn't gum -- it was pajamas. The pajamas, you see, were made in Cuba. Can't sell 'em, dictates the Helms-Burton Act. So Wal-Mart, when it discovered the offending garments, started pulling them off the shelves. Wait a second, said Canada's Government -- you can't do that either. It's against Canadian law to obey that American law. Various nations, Canada included, are challenging Helms-Burton, saying it is America's attempt to strong-arm the world. Washington, with a straight face, responds that it may have to label this a ''national security'' issue. Invasion of the killer pajamas. **********HOLLYWOOD **********$60 Million Monsters **********Imagine it. Imelda Marcos, opening her closet, is shocked, shocked to find all those shoes. Absurd? Well, consider this: Movie executives were variously ''horrified,'' ''disturbed,'' ''appalled'' and merely ''upset'' last week when the Motion Picture Association of America announced that the average cost of making and marketing a movie had reached nearly $60 million last year, two and a half times the price a decade ago. Come on, now. Those are the very executives who order all those snazzy car chases, all those buildings being blown up, all those sky-high salaries for the stars of the moment. Is it all necessary? Instead of charging $7 or $8 for a ticket, couldn't they charge $4.50 and, after the hero jumps in a car to pursue the villain, just put a silent-movie title on the screen that says: ''Imagine a chase scene here. (You know: just like all the others you've seen.)'' **********FEDERAL LARGESS **********Remember the Richest **********Washington, you may have heard, has a terrible time balancing its books. Congress has an annual brawl about some odd amendment to force it to mend its ways, with the latest effort dying a hero's death last week in the Senate. The problem, you see, is that there are all these worthwhile things the Government feels it must do -- like, say, offering a half-million dollars to Greenwich, Conn., so it can spruce up its main street. Now this street, mind you, is not exactly a grim boulevard of plywood-clad windows and broken bottles. Far from it. The Government, though, in its infinite wisdom, does not discriminate against the Rolex and Lauren set, so it deemed Greenwich worthy of this largess. But last week Greenwich, in its infinite wealth, proudly said, No thanks. **********LEGAL FOLLIES **********Caution: Falling Warnings! **********Which are more plentiful -- products that could harm us, or lawyers dying to sue someone? That's a tough one. It's tempting to say lawyers, of course. But think of all the things either slowly poisoning us or threatening to puncture, scald or otherwise attack us. Product makers, naturally, want to avoid injuries -- but, it often seems, they especially want to avoid lawsuits. So as lawsuits get sillier -- ''No one warned me not to swallow that telephone,'' the plaintiff complains -- product warnings have matched silliness for silliness. ''Cape does not enable user to fly,'' warns the Batman costume. ''This product does not have brakes,'' warns a plastic sled. And, of course, the post-lawsuit warning on McDonald's coffee: ''Caution: Hot!'' Well, yes. **********TOUGH JUSTICE **********Hoffenberg's Day in Court **********If you get a letter from Steven Hoffenberg promising untold wealth if you'll only give him your life savings to invest, it might be best to file it with the rest of your junk mail. If you hear that Mr. Hoffenberg is offering to buy, say, some local tabloid, it's a safe bet the deal won't fly. Mr. Hoffenberg, you see -- brash, unlikely bidder for The New York Post, and the man who bilked investors out of hundreds of millions -- was sentenced last week to 20 years in prison. Harsh, you say? Not to the judge, who dispensed this stern justice after hearing numerous tales of lives smashed by Mr. Hoffenberg's ''greed.'' This man, he said, must be ''barred from causing further damage to society.'' Mr. Hoffenberg did get one break: the judge now says he owes his victims just $462 million, not $475 million. The stone, in other words, must shed a drop less blood. **********CABLEVISION **********The Only Game in Town **********If you want to watch New York's sports teams on television, your choices now practically come down to this: Cablevision, Cablevision or Cablevision. The big Long Island cable company, which already owns half of Madison Square Garden, is buying the other half from ITT for $650 million. By combining the MSG Network with Sportschannel, Cablevision will have a virtual lock on everything from the Knicks to the Yankees to the Rangers. Given how sports-addicted New Yorkers are, that's a lot of power in one place -- like having the only bar in a town full of heavy drinkers -- and concerns quickly arose about what this would do to prices. So if you need your regular dose of sweating, swatting superstars, think good thoughts about Cablevision. **********WALL STREET **********A Paycheck Apart **********Wall Street, in an economic sense, has seceded from New York City. It used to be that when the securities industry was fat and happy, the rest of the city was fat and happy, too -- that when jobs and salaries rose downtown, they rose everywhere. No more. While the pin-striped few have been getting those Ferrari-size bonus checks, wages elsewhere have stagnated. From 1989 to 1995, securities workers' pay -- adjusted for inflation -- soared 42 percent, while wages outside those bustling walls have not even crept ahead by 4 percent. Do those millions buy happiness, though?

So far this month, money has poured into those funds at Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group, the two largest fund companies, as well as at Charles Schwab & Company, which sells mutual funds from hundreds of smaller companies. **********The money entering funds has slowed somewhat from last month, but ''that's not surprising,'' said Brian Mattes, a Vanguard vice president, given the recent volatility in the domestic and foreign stock markets. In addition, he said, ''investors usually hesitate to buy until after most funds have paid out distributions'' of capital gains and dividends, which for most fund companies occurs in early to mid-December. **********Until last month, investors had remained similarly steadfast in their love for international and global stock funds, despite their having been battered for months by Asian currency devaluations and unstable equity markets that stretched from the Pacific Rim through Latin America to Eastern Europe. **********Tutored by fund companies and investment advisers to diversify by sending money to the far corners of the globe, Americans this year added an average of $4 billion a month to international stock funds, which invest only outside the United States, and global funds, which can also buy American stocks. **********In October, however, only $1.3 million trickled into international and global funds, according to figures released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group. Not since December 1990, when $55.9 million flowed out of the group, have overseas stock funds suffered a worse month. **********Meanwhile, Government bond funds, once the largest category of fixed-income mutual funds, received $187 million in net new cash in October, the trade group reported. That ended a string of months in which money flowed out of the Government funds that stretched back to October 1993, shortly before the Federal Reserve moved to raise interest rates. **********As money dribbled out of Government bond funds over the last four years, and as the returns from fixed-income investments have lagged behind those of equities, other categories of bond funds have become more popular with investors, particularly those specializing in high-yield or junk bonds and municipal bonds. **********Funds investing in fixed-income securities with high current yields accounted for the biggest portion of the cash flows to fixed-income funds all year, including in October, when all bond funds received $3.7 billion, about even with the previous month. **********Those latest developments overseas and at home apparently did little to dampen investors' enthusiasm for American stock funds, which received a revised $18.2 billion in new investments last month, the fourth-highest total so far in 1997. **********Previously, the trade group had estimated that stock funds of all types had added $21 billion last month, which would have been the third-highest inflow of the year. While the revised figure is down from September's intake of $25.7 billion, it remained above the October 1996 figure of $13.5 billion. **********As expected, the October cash flows left the total collected by stock funds so far in 1997 ahead of last year's record pace. In the first 10 months of 1997, investors added $195.6 billion to their stock fund investments, bringing the total assets of the funds to $2.3 trillion. In the period last year, stock funds took in $192.5 billion, on their way to a record 12-month total of $221.4 billion. **********The two largest fund companies reported that the cash has continued to flow this month, although at slower rates than before the stock market's late-October slump. **********Fidelity and Vanguard each expect their stock funds to receive $1.5 billion in new investments in November, officials at those companies said yesterday. At Vanguard, that is about half the level recorded in October, said Mr. Mattes. **********But T. Rowe Price reported that domestic stock funds are attracting more new money this month than last, while international funds continue to lose money. **********At Schwab, whose Mutual Fund Marketplace serves as a primary distributor for the funds of hundreds of companies, net flows into all stock funds measured about $330 million so far in November, about half the level of last month, with the largest flows  into the most conservative stock funds like growth and income funds, which invest in blue-chip stocks that typically pay dividends. **********Bond funds, however, have added to their take, gaining $291 million in net new cash so far in November, up from $170 million for all of October."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/02/business/using-boss-pitch-product-comes-cyberspace-streetcom-bids-for-subscribers.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 818, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Using the boss to pitch the product comes to cyberspace as the Street.com bids for subscribers.", "print_headline": "Using the boss to pitch the product comes to cyberspace as the Street.com bids for subscribers.", "body_text": " **********ENLISTING the top executives of consumer product companies for double duty as pitchmen -- from Lee A.

Cramer, the free-tongued money manager who doubles as a financial journalist for newspapers, magazines and cable networks as well as the Street.com Web site (http:// www.thestreet.com). **********The campaign, produced by Ryan Drossman & Partners in New York, carries the assertive theme ''Get it right.'' The goal is to sell subscriptions to the site, at $12.95 a month, by capitalizing on the irreverent, street-smart image of Mr. Cramer, who is also president of Cramer Berkowitz & Company, a private money management firm. **********''In extensive focus-group research before we created the advertising, we found our target audience was the heavy trader who has the mindset almost of a gambler,'' said Avi Dan, senior vice president for strategic planning at Ryan Drossman. ''He wants information that will give him an edge, wants it fast and from a credible source. **********''And this audience is very skeptical about financial information,'' he added, 'thinking a lot of it is hogwash. They need someone they can relate to and believe in like Cramer, who's one of them.'' **********Neil Drossman, chairman and creative director at Ryan Drossman, agreed that Mr. Cramer's take-no-prisoners personality was an asset. **********''When we met him, he was passionate and outspoken almost to the point where we didn't quite believe it,'' Mr. Drossman said. ''What better face to put on it?'' **********So in one commercial, Mr. Cramer spoofs the classic campaign for Smith Barney with a haughty John Houseman. ''If we made money the old-fashioned way,'' Mr. Cramer declares, ''we'd still be driving Model T's, dialing rotary phones and getting our fingers dirty from ink.'' **********In the other commercials, Mr. Cramer's pugnacious intensity and bombastic delivery evoke Peter Finch as Howard Beale, the news anchor who becomes the ''mad prophet of the airwaves'' in the 1976 film ''Network.'' **********One spot presents Mr. Cramer ranting about ''those boring blue-chip stocks, stocks that you buy and love and buy some more. **********''I hate them with a passion,'' he continues, ''because you can never have an edge on them. They are for lazy managers.'' As he speaks, these words appear on screen: ''Tell us what you really feel, Jim. Don't hold back, it's unhealthy.'' **********Mr. Cramer, in a phone interview punctuated with brief asides to associates at Cramer Berkowitz to ''Bring in all the Seagate common'' and ''Let Western Digital run,'' described the campaign strategy as driven by sound business reasons rather than by ego. **********''It makes sense to use me,'' Mr. Cramer said, ''because the voice of the publication is derivative of my voice. It's suffused with a jocular, 'sportsy' attitude and spirit.'' **********Mr. Cramer praised the sports sections of newspapers for offering a ''higher accounting'' of who they cover than do business sections. **********''The sports section says Messier's tired,'' he said, referring to Mark Messier, the captain and center of the New York Rangers. ''If he were the president of a company, the story would never say he was tired. It would say he's 'subdued.' **********''And if Jimmy Key were the C.E.O. of General Electric and left for Allied Signal,'' he continued, referring to the pitcher the New York Yankees let go to the Baltimore Orioles, ''they'd never ask, 'Who let him go?' I say, find the bad guy.'' **********Mr. Cramer, who shares ownership of the Street.com with its editorial staff and Martin Peretz, editor in chief and chairman of The New Republic magazine, acknowledged that sometimes the bad guy is nearby. **********''My voice is, 'Trust no one, including us,' '' he said. ''When we screw up, at least we'll tell you.'' **********For instance, when asked how much has been spent on Street.com, Mr. Cramer replied, ''About $3 million, of which I'd say $2 million was good spending and $1 million was errant spending on ill-fated direct marketing and initially poorly executed technology.'' **********Mr. Cramer also admitted to being ''incredibly nervous'' about how the campaign fares because, he said, ''not since my junior year of high school when I played Lieutenant Rooney -- the cop who comes in at the end -- in 'Arsenic and Old Lace' have I done any acting.'' **********So far, the Web site has registered 5,700 members, Mr. Cramer said. To get to 25,000, the break-even figure, he added, ''we'll commit to a couple million dollars'' in ad spending. **********''If we catch on fire, we'll have 50,000 paid subscribers by the end of the year,'' Mr. Cramer said, which ''would justify three or four million in advertising. And with 100,000, it would be five million.'' **********Plans call for the commercials to begin this week or next week in Dallas and San Francisco; if successful, they will run nationally in August or September, Mr. Cramer said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/16/business/a-closing-notice-or-not.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Closing Notice, or Not", "print_headline": "A Closing Notice, or Not", "body_text": " **********The company no longer has need of someone's services, and the message must be delivered.

Only a few weeks ago, a rate restructuring was announced that will reduce long-distance rates but boost by 60 percent the rates of local calls, which have a far heavier volume. The restructuring also will raise monthly fees. **********Mr. Liguori suggested that individual investors buy and hold Telebras through its full privatization, scheduled for 1998.

The company said that net income from continuing operations dropped 24 percent in the first quarter and that the next quarter would also fall short of earlier estimates. **********AT&T reported income from continuing operations of $1.12 billion, compared with $1.46 billion in the first quarter of last year. Its revenue inched up 1.5 percent, to $13.05 percent from $12.85 billion. **********Although analysts had been preparing for lower earnings, AT&T still managed to disappoint them. And several said yesterday that they planned to lower their projections for the rest of the year. **********''This is a little like the Titanic,'' said Linda B. Meltzer, an analyst at UBS Securities. ''AT&T's earnings are at the high end this quarter and are only going to go down for the rest of the year.'' **********The company's shares dropped 62.5 cents yesterday, to $33, in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Including income from discontinued operations of $4 million, its net income was $1.13 billion, or 69 cents a share, down from $1.36 billion, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. The 1996 quarter took into account a loss from discontinued operations of $107 million, or 7 cents a share. **********Several analysts focused on the widening gap between AT&T's sluggish revenue growth, and the growth in the volume of calls, which was relatively robust, at 6.7 percent. They said the disparity underscored AT&T's buffeting by rivals like GTE and discount carriers like World Xchange. The new competitors are eroding its profit margins even as the overall long-distance market grows. **********Even AT&T's booming wireless division is starting to show scars from competition, as wireless upstarts invade major markets like New York City. Revenue in the division grew nearly 14 percent, to $1.02 billion, but AT&T signed up 9.7 percent fewer new subscribers in the first quarter than it did in the comparable period last year. **********Steven W. Hooper, chief executive of AT&T Wireless Services, said in a conference call with analysts that price competition had erupted in several AT&T markets. But he predicted that the new competitors would not be able to sustain their offers of free telephone minutes for long. **********As for the wired business, revenue in AT&T's consumer division declined $62 million, to $6.05 billion, while revenue in the healthier business division increased $129 million, to $5.45 billion. **********Despite the poor results, AT&T appears to be taking the first steps to turn around its core business. Gail J. McGovern, head of the consumer long-distance division, said the company had sharply cut the number of checks it sends people to woo them to switch to AT&T. Last year, those checks cost the company $1 billion. **********''While we have much to do and implement, our marketing transformation has begun,'' Ms. McGovern said. **********At AT&T's presentation to analysts last month, she pledged to reduce the percentage of customers drawn by checks to 20 percent from 60 percent by the end of the year. Yesterday, she said the company had already pushed the share below 40 percent. **********''The consumer business is going through a difficult period,'' Stephanie Comfort, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said. ''But you can see a glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel.'' **********AT&T's business division is also exhibiting some strength. Jeffrey Weitzen, the head of the unit, said it had signed major new contracts in the quarter with Kmart, SmithKline Beecham and the United States Treasury Department. **********Some analysts, however, were troubled that AT&T recorded only $1 billion in capital expenditures in the first quarter. The company said last month that it would spend $7 billion to $8 billion this year to upgrade its wired and wireless phone networks -- a huge outlay that contributed to its pessimistic earnings forecast. If AT&T still plans to spend $6 billion to $7 billion in the remaining three quarters of the year, analysts said, it could further drag down earnings. **********Beyond capital spending, AT&T is also finding day-to-day competition more expensive. The company said its costs jumped to $424 million in the first quarter because of the larger cash reserve it was setting aside to compensate for unpaid bills. New Federal regulations are also forcing AT&T to pay local phone companies more to connect the calls of customers who dial toll-free numbers from its pay phones. **********''The cost pressures are intense, and 1998 is going to be even worse,'' said Frank Governali, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. **********A final area of weakness is AT&T's financial services division, primarily its Universal Card. Revenue in the division declined 18.7 percent, to $390 million, as the company continued to feel the effects of a change in its accounting methods last year, and the declining use of the card. **********AT&T's travails in the long-distance market contrast starkly with the situation of regional Bell telephone companies, which are riding a tide of growth in the local market. The BellSouth Corporation announced yesterday that its income rose 11 percent, to $693 million, in the first quarter. **********Those figures excluded a one-time gain of $344 million that BellSouth recorded in the first quarter of 1996 from the sale of its paging operations. Factoring in that gain, net income dropped nearly 29 percent. BellSouth's revenue increased 6.7 percent, to $4.8 billion. **********The company said its growth was driven by a seemingly insatiable appetite for additional phone lines. BellSouth, which offers local phone service in nine Southern states, added a record 254,000 residential phone lines -- 106,000 of which were second lines. The company said it was the first quarter that it had ever sold more than 100,000 second lines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/business/brother-or-sister-can-you-spare-a-dime-for-a-boom-era-economist.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-09-18", "snippet": "Economists at National Association for Business Economics annual meeting say sustained prosperity, corporate downsizing that has made research expendable and backlash against economic fraternity's inlfated forecasting claims have all combined to m...", "word_count": 827, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brother (or Sister), Can You Spare a Dime for a Boom-Era Economist?", "print_headline": "Brother (or Sister), Can You Spare a Dime for a Boom-Era Economist?", "body_text": " **********The better the economy, the worse things seem to get for economists. **********Fifteen years of expansion interrupted by just one brief downturn in the early 1990's have helped to erode the market for the people in American corporations who study the economy for a living. ''If your job is forecasting recessions, you've got a pretty sleepy job,'' said Paul Boltz, an economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. **********That was just one reason that the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, which concluded here today in this city known for celebrating good times, was such a sedate affair. **********Sustained prosperity, corporate downsizing that has made research expendable and a backlash against the economic fraternity's inflated forecasting claims have all combined to make the life of a business economist tougher than ever. Indeed, for a lot of economists these days, job insecurity is not an abstract principle but a day-to-day reality. **********Much of the program at the meeting was given over to self-improvement panels on topics like ''successful job switching,'' ''hot career opportunities'' and ''how economists can play a role in their firm's decision making,'' and corridor talk often began with old friends telling of new jobs or the search for them. **********Among the missing was Alison Lynn Reaser. A former economist at  First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, she lost that job in the takeover by Wells Fargo & Company. She landed at Barnett Banks in Florida but is now uncertain of what will happen after its acquisition by Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C. Ms. Reaser had signed up to attend the meeting here but could not make it because of a freeze on travel by Barnett, a friend said. **********''Hundreds of economists are in the same boat,'' said Ken Ackbarali, a Los Angeles consultant who lost his job in the Wells Fargo takeover of First Interstate. **********John H. Ortego was left behind in Albany when his one-time employer, the Key Corporation, moved to Cleveland. ''I have joined the army of the self-employed,'' said Mr. Ortego, who just resigned his latest post as an economist in Buffalo with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. **********While banks and industrial companies have been trimming economics departments for years, the employment distress in this field has never been so acute. And the contrast with the 1980's -- which started with a deep recession and saw record Federal budget deficits amid a booming stock market and the end of high inflation -- could not be starker. **********''We were in nirvana as economists in the early 80's,'' said Bernard M. Markstein, who set up a consulting business in Phoenixville, Pa., after losing a job at Meridian Bank just before it was taken over by Corestates Bank. **********Now, cost-conscious senior management finds little use for predictions from in-house experts when a wide array of forecasts, none of them particularly more trustworthy than another, are readily available. **********''Forecasting,'' Mr. Markstein acknowledged, ''is not what we do best.'' **********Not that they don't keep trying. The National Association for Business Economics consensus predicts that the economy will grow 2.3 percent next year. And slightly more than half of the respondents are forecasting a recession in 1999. But even the experts do not put much stock in those predictions. ''There was a lot of money to be made'' in forecasting, especially of interest rates, said William Dunkelberg, an economics professor at Temple University and chief consultant to the National Federation of Independent Business. ''Now we know we can't do that.'' **********That explains why the association, which has seen membership decline 10 percent over the last decade, is searching for a new identity. **********''We are less and less an association of traditional members doing macroeconomics forecasting in a corporate center economic unit,'' said C. Mark Dadd of AT&T, the current president of the association.  To reflect the new reality, the group just changed its name from the National Association ''of Business Economists'' to the National Association ''for Business Economics.'' **********Its new mission is to help members apply their economic skills to specific corporate problems rather than make grand but dubious pronouncements about the entire economy. **********This somewhat humbler ambition seemed especially striking when set against the opening address on Monday by Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, who declared the stellar performance of the economy to be a triumph of national economic policy making rather than favorable circumstances and improved corporate competitiveness. **********''The conventional explanations,'' he said, ''do not recognize the central role of the monetary policy the Fed has made over the past 17 years and the more recent contribution of improved fiscal policy.'' **********At other sessions, one speaker after another concentrated on practical ways for economists to ''add value,'' enhancing their careers by filling such specialty niches as litigation analysis and transfer pricing or adopting strategies for turning themselves into executives. **********In the end, several economists noted, they are victims of the very market forces that the profession so often exults.

And his television set, not too far away, was tuned to CNBC financial news. **********As he watched, the Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply, culminating in a 247-point loss, the biggest one-day selloff in almost six years. **********But the 64-year-old retired engineer, who has made a hobby of tracking the market's every move, was unshaken by the news. **********''I don't think it's all that surprising,'' Mr. Sadoff said in a telephone interview from his home in Chevy Chase, Md. ''It'll go down another 100 or 150 points, but I'm not that nervous.'' **********Mr. Sadoff is unfazed because market adjustments like this have repeatedly occurred in a long bull market that many analysts say began in 1982. He remembers October 1987, when the Dow plummeted 508 points in a single session, to 1,738.41. Yet just 12 days ago, the blue-chip index reached 8,259.31, a fourfold gain. **********It is that kind of return that has drawn millions of first-time investors into the stock market in the last decade. And it is that kind of investor attitude that has kept the market upbeat, even in sharp downturns like the current one. **********Of course, no one is willing to say that the Dow will not fall further this week, but few of the dozens of investors interviewed this weekend believe that the market is seriously ailing, or about to collapse. Indeed, many displayed a degree of self-assuredness that seemed to border on arrogance. **********''Yes, a 247-point drop is a big number,'' said Lou Methner, 70, of Denver. ''But out of how many Dow points?'' **********7,942. **********''And what was the Dow at six months ago?'' **********6,988. **********''Well, there you go. It's been a good run this year.'' **********This is much the same sentiment that was expressed in March and April, when the Dow tumbled 9.8 percent over several weeks after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to slow what appeared to be an overheating economy. **********But then, as now, confident investors said they considered the downturn in market prices to be a good buying opportunity. **********Still, with the Dow off 6.8 percent in the last seven sessions, some people on Wall Street wonder whether the market will now see its first 10 percent decline since 1990. This is the longest stretch that the Dow has ever gone without such a drop. And some Wall Street analysts wonder whether reaching that level might depress investor sentiment. **********On the whole, though, analysts are unshaken by the market's recent slide, partly because they had been calling for such a pullback. After all, the Dow was up nearly 29 percent in little more than three months, and that kind of pace cannot be sustained, they said. Broader market gauges, like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, have also risen sharply. **********To those analysts, the selloff might have been sparked by any of a number of reasons: the United Parcel Service strike, for example, which created fears of rising labor costs. Or a spurt of selling linked to the recent reduction in the capital gains tax rate. Or warnings of profit slowdowns from Coca-Cola and Gillette, which had been two of the steadiest performers. **********But many individual investors pointed out that the market had been spooked before by similar concerns, only to rebound. In other words, the decline is only a mild correction, they said over and over, using the Wall Street lingo for a sharp, but temporary, price decline that interrupts a longer, upward trend. Some called it a buying opportunity, and others suggested that a short-term slump was healthy for the market. **********This is the individual investor as stock market guru. And why not? While some of Wall Street's best-known strategists have been bearish for years, Americans have been piling into the stock market in droves. The explosion of money invested in mutual funds, notably in 401(k) retirement plans, is what has given the bull market its momentum. **********Besides, they say, the economy is humming along, inflation seems to be absent, interest rates are stable, the dollar is king and corporate profits remain strong. There is even talk that the economy has entered a qualitatively new era, one in which all these market-friendly trends converge and can be sustained. **********Of course, last week -- as the market was sliding -- mutual fund companies began reporting that the big inflows of July had slowed, and even turned around, according to Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a tracking service. About $3.2 billion was redeemed from stock funds last week, the biggest pullback since the late-winter selloff. But many investors interviewed this weekend said that they had sold some shares simply to take profits after the recent gains and to wait out the current downturn -- not to flee. **********Indeed, it is that kind of investor -- investors like Robert Boisselle -- who are powering the bull run. Mr. Boisselle, a retired real estate broker in Redding, Calif., tunes in to financial news every day, and calls up his stock portfolio on the Internet each evening. His advice to friends: stay the course. **********''We had a pretty fat correction on Friday,'' he said. ''But I've been through corrections before. In fact, I look forward to them as a cleansing of the market.'' **********Vince Capurso, a tax lawyer in New York, also sees therapeutic effects in a quick, sharp downturn. In fact, for more than a year, he has been slightly bearish on the market, worrying that his fellow investors were too euphoric. **********''I've got a friend who, at 50 years old, retired and got a severance package,'' he said. ''He took that money and invested it, and he's been making 30 or 40 percent a year. Now he has a couple million in the stock market, and he wants to be a money manager. He thinks it's so easy to make money, but the fact is, these are the golden years.'' **********In fact, Mr. Capurso said, four of his six closest friends all want to quit their jobs to become money managers. A nice correction, he said, might temper such exuberance. **********While Mr. Capurso frowns on overly optimistic market sentiment, he believes that the heightened interest in the market will help buoy its long-term prospects and prevent a small downturn from becoming a collapse. Ordinary investors, he reasons, are more sophisticated than ever, aided by technological advances that bring Main Street and Wall Street closer. **********Throughout the country, investors are trading shares over the Internet, tuning in to financial news networks and even wearing beepers to track companies that plan to split their stock; these investors believe that splits augur well for a company's future, and they quickly buy those shares on such news. **********Indeed, market news just will not go away. CNBC superimposes minute-by-minute Dow industrial figures, allowing viewers access to every uptick or downtick. CNBC can also be seen by passersby in Times Square, on a gigantic outdoor television screen. **********But that is not all. Customers at Brooks Brothers, while hunting for a nice new blazer, can check stock quotes at a Bloomberg financial news terminal. The Regency Hotel in New York also has a Bloomberg terminal, in its restaurant. **********There are also scores of Internet sites devoted to the markets, like Wall Street City, or the Silicon Investor for technology-stock buffs. And on the World Wide Web, stock talkers were debating over the weekend whether the market was primed for a full-fledged crash. **********On a Web site devoted to the market, one disturbed investor posted a message that read: ''In the past two weeks, the Dow is down 7 percent. I am sick and tired of people calling this a technical correction. The fact is the market is crashing.'' **********But another replied: ''I think it is a normal (probably overdue) correction. Why do you think we will have a crash? What economic/political/financial event has given you this belief?'' **********As for Mr. Sadoff, the unperturbed engineer, he said he would wait out the downturn and then sink more cash into the market. ''I've been lightening up on stocks a little in the past few weeks,'' he said. ''But when the charts start to show it's safe, I'll start sticking my toe in the water again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/03/world/army-truck-firebombed-13-israelis-are-wounded.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Greenberg", "pub_date": "1997-04-03", "snippet": "Driver of Israeli Army truck and 12 soldiers are hurt in firebomb attack near West Bank Palestian refugee camp, Jalazoun; attack is most serious in series of recent assaults on Israeli vehicles traveling West Bank roads; Israeli border police impo...", "word_count": 504, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Army Truck Firebombed; 13 Israelis Are Wounded", "print_headline": "Army Truck Firebombed; 13 Israelis Are Wounded", "body_text": " **********A passenger truck carrying Israeli soldiers plunged off an embankment, overturned and burned today near this Palestinian refugee camp after a firebomb was thrown through its windshield. **********The driver and 12 soldiers were  hurt in the attack, the most serious in a series of assaults in recent weeks on Israeli vehicles traveling West Bank roads. **********There has been daily stone-throwing at Israeli cars in the West Bank and some firebombs have also been  thrown during a wave of violent Palestinian protests that began after groundbreaking work started two weeks ago on a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem. **********The Israeli Channel 2 television station reported tonight that Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai had approved plans to build thousands  more apartments in Jewish settlements in the West Bank -- a move likely to further aggravate tensions. **********The incident today occurred at a bend in the Ramallah-Nablus road that bypasses Jalazoun, a hillside refugee camp from which stones have been thrown at Israeli vehicles in recent days. **********The Israeli commander at the scene, identified only as Lieutenant Colonel Shlomo, said a firebomb was  thrown through the windshield of the driver's compartment of the passenger truck, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. **********The truck went off the road, overturned and caught fire, but the soldiers and driver were freed without serious injury.

And after weeks in which rumors of wild conduct by the young and rich leaped into the popular press, the official crackdown has been widely applauded by Egyptians who in taxis and coffee shops now refer disparagingly to the ''deviant youths.'' **********But the crackdown has been criticized by some intellectuals and human rights advocates as reflecting an unfortunate Egyptian predisposition to use security forces to address social problems. **********''The police can only arrest those who break the law,'' the prominent writer Fahmy Howeidi wrote in the Government-run newspaper Al Ahram. ''But they would be assuming a bigger role than they can fill if they think they can reform misdeeds.'' **********Like most things Western, heavy-metal music came late to Cairo, and it enjoys only a limited following. But over the last year its screeching guitars and often violent lyrics had emerged, for some, as a vehicle for the kind of unrestrained expression on which Islamic culture frowns heavily. **********Those who have attended them say  recent heavy-metal gatherings have at the least been notable for the consumption of alcohol and for public displays of affection, both generally taboo. In mimicry of Western bands and their followers, some fans have also gone so far as to adorn their clothing with symbols meant to have Satanic significance. **********Whether what occurred beyond the public gaze went further to include the kind of blood-and-sex rituals that the popular Egyptian magazine Rosa al-Yousef has described may never be known. But the reports that began late last year set off such an outcry that Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi, the architect of Egypt's six-year crackdown on Islamic militants, swiftly pledged in reference to the heavy-metal fans ''to identify these groups and uproot them all.'' **********Among those who complained most loudly about the reported evil deeds was the Grand Mufti of Egypt, Nasr Farid Wassail, who as the highest authority in Sunni Islam wields considerable power even in what remains a secular state. The Mufti, who has portrayed the offenders as apostates before God, was reported to have met personally with Mr. Alfi last December to demand that they be made to repent. **********The ''contempt of heavenly religions'' statute under which the authorities say that those arrested may be charged was incorporated into Egyptian law to try to limit sectarian strife between Muslims and the country's Coptic Christian minority, legal experts here say. **********The law carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and was invoked in the early 1980's as the grounds for the arrest of militant Muslim preachers who had preached against Copts, who make up about 10 percent of the population. **********Among the offenses punishable under the statute are the unearthing of corpses, the desecration of holy books and the ridiculing of religious rituals or figures, including the Christian, Islamic and Jewish prophets. In practice, the legal experts say, the law has been more often waved as a club than wielded as a legal weapon, and some think that the authorities' main purpose now is to deliver a powerful scare. **********Among youthful sectors of Egyptian society most tempted by the extremes of Western tastes, the episode already appears to have prompted some behavior modification. **********''Almost everyone I know has cut his hair short'' to avoid being mistaken for a heavy-metal fan, said Akram Mustafa, a student at the American University in Cairo, an expensive private institution. ''And girls  won't wear their black lipstick or even their black leather jackets.'' **********But after nearly three weeks in which those still in custody have neither been charged nor released and face the specter of being charged with what amounts to an offense before God, people sympathetic to them have voiced mostly bitterness. **********''We all danced and sang when we were young, and we never got arrested for it,'' said a mother who recently waited in vain with her sister, her lawyer and the family driver for news of her son, who is still in custody.

LVMH is also to receive $:500 million, or about $810 million, split evenly between cash and a special dividend that would be distributed to all GMG shareholders. **********Investors applauded the news, seeing savings, economies of scale and the end of what had been expected to be a protracted battle. In London, the shares of Guinness rose 28.5 pence, to 605.5 pence, and those of Grand Met were up 21 pence, to 604 pence; in Paris, LVMH stock rose 25 francs a share, to 1,248. **********The news came as a surprise to many analysts, because Mr. Arnault has previously shown a taste for lengthy fights. **********Guinness and Grand Met said in May that they intended to merge their drinks and foods businesses, which together make up the lion's share of the European spirits business, as well as Guinness beer and Grand Met's Burger King restaurants and Pillsbury food units. **********Mr. Arnault, who owns stakes in both Guinness and Grand Met and whose luxury-goods company owns several high-end spirits, including Moet et Chandon and Hennessy Cognac, opposed the merger, lest he end up a lesser player in liquor. **********Mr. Arnault instead proposed that Guinness, Grand Met and LVMH merge their drink businesses, that Grand Met spin off its food entities and that Guinness get rid of its breweries. He also sought a 35 percent stake in that merged company. **********Guinness and Grand Met took a dim view of Mr. Arnault's proposal. He then began to increase his stake in Grand Met, raising it to 11.1 percent. Though he cut his position in Guinness, he kept an 11.47 percent stake. That gave him more than the 10 percent needed to call a special shareholder meeting at each company. **********Eventually, the parties came to the bargaining table. Under yesterday's 10-year agreement, the current drinks distribution ventures of LVMH and Guinness in the United States, Asia and France are now to include Grand Met brands. LVMH is to retain the 66 percent it owns in its own drinks business, Moet Hennessy, and the 34 percent that Guinness owns will go into GMG Brands. **********It was not immediately clear yesterday whether there were three moderate winners or three partial losers emerging from the deal. ''It was a good settlement for both sides,'' said Russell Duckworth, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London. ''Guinness and Grand Met have come to an agreement with LVMH and reduced the risk of them disrupting the deal. But they paid for it by giving up their side of the benefits of distribution.'' **********The merged parties estimate that the reconfigured distribution network will save them about $:20 million each annually in costs. But there is some question as to how much that savings may be worth, since Mr. Arnault's support came at so high a price. And while Mr. Arnault expressed pleasure in the deal, it is not as sweet as the one he had proposed. **********''It is disappointing to see that LVMH is not coming in 100 percent,'' said Martin Hawkins, an analyst at Greig Middleton in London. ''It would have been unusual if Grand Met didn't go through with Guinness anyway, so this added nothing to the merger but cured what would have been a lingering aggravation.'' **********Mr. Arnault may have conceded earlier than he would have liked because he had trouble convincing investors that his alternative proposition was worth the end result. **********LVMH shares have suffered recently as sales of its luxury fashion, leather and spirits businesses have been sluggish, in part because of a weaker yen which has limited spending overseas by Japanese travelers. **********Some of Mr. Arnault's biggest shareholders may well have been clamoring for results. ''I thought he would fight it out,'' said Cedric Magnelia, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. ''But a lot of large institutional investors would not support his proposition.'' **********On the other hand, Mr. Arnault may use his new board seat, his hand in distribution and his generally aggressive nature to push for the break of assets he has sought. **********''Both managements have looked in the past and wondered if the groups together make sense,'' said an investment banker who worked on the deal and spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''If it makes sense from shareholder viewpoint, I am sure they will consider it.'' **********Regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe have yet to sign off on the merger. The European Union has already expressed some concern about GMG's possible dominant market position in Greece, Spain, Belgium and Ireland. European regulators may force the new company to shed some holdings; in that case, it would most likely get rid of secondary brands. **********Some analysts said they thought that regulators would cause little trouble, but others worried that selling pieces of the company would erode the point of the merger, which was to dominate all aspects of the spirits business. **********''The story of the late 80's was spirits companies wrestling back control of third-party distribution,'' Mr. Hawkins noted.

Her father was a horseman, so were her customers at a local restaurant, and so was the man she married; they had their first date at the Vernon Downs race track, and watched his horse win. **********So when she found out the track had serious financial problems, she says, she just had to get involved in trying to oust the old management and bring in new blood with new ideas. ''I'm doing this because I care about my community,'' she said last week. **********But what strikes her supporters as spunk looks like monumental chutzpah to thousands of people from faraway Miami to nearby Syracuse who are watching the battle over the track with outrage. **********That's because Gwen Bennett is the wife of Patrick Bennett, whom regulators accused a year ago of running the biggest pyramid scheme in American history through the companies known as the Bennett Group of Syracuse. When the companies collapsed, they owed about $1 billion to banks and to 12,000 individuals who invested in leases on office equipment, according to the bankruptcy trustee handling the case; roughly $600 million is missing. **********Among the missing money is about $4 million that Pat Bennett used to buy a stake in the small public company that owns the race track, the stake that Gwen is now using to try to take control, according to the trustee, Richard C. Breeden, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was appointed by the bankruptcy court with the backing of his former agency. **********Mr. Breeden is trying to stop the Bennetts from gaining control of the track. ''That would create a lot of new victims of this whole saga, and there are victims enough,'' he said. As long as the Bennetts are involved, he argues, the track cannot raise money and is in danger of closing, perhaps costing hundreds of jobs in an area where work is scarce. **********But Mr. Breeden is not getting much help from state or Federal regulators, the bankruptcy court, or even the Justice Department, which has taken no further action against Mr. Bennett after filing a criminal complaint a year ago charging him with perjury and securities fraud. **********Mr. Bennett has denied the charges, but has refused to comment further. His lawyers say that if mistakes were made, Mr. Bennett never meant to do anything wrong. He remains here in Vernon, a village of some 1,200 people, living in his family's elegant gray-and-white house, chatting with neighbors at the post office -- and talking with Gwen about her campaign to take over Vernon Downs. **********The track fight is rubbing salt in the wounds of the investors, many of them elderly, who have lost big sums in what they were told was a conservative investment. At a meeting of investors last month in Newark, a crowd of about 400 reserved its strongest applause for one of their fellows, Morton B. Kushner of Huntingdon Valley, Pa. ''It's been almost a year and Patrick Bennett is still walking around free, still doing business,'' Mr. Kushner said angrily. ''If a criminal stole $100 from a store, he'd be locked up in jail!'' **********The Bennett situation shows how widespread and unexpected the consequences of a huge financial collapse can be, and how they can seem to overwhelm the system that is supposed to deal with them. The S.E.C. says the equipment leasing was a fraud and filed a civil case against the Bennett companies last year. But the S.E.C. has no criminal powers and little control over people who, like the Bennetts, are not technically in the securities business. **********The United States Attorney's office in Manhattan says it has been conducting an active investigation, but the lawyer handling the case was, until March, busy prosecuting another matter. Securities lawyers say the case is finally heating up again, and there may be legal developments soon. **********The Bankruptcy Court in Utica, the site of most of the Bennett litigation, has been swamped with hundreds of lawsuits as people fight over what is left of the Bennett empire. The bankruptcy is unusually complicated because of ''the allegations of fraud, questions of how to divide the pie and questions of who owes the estate money and assets,'' said Harry M. Gutfleish, a lawyer representing creditors. Adding to the confusion is the fact that Bennett litigation is taking place all over the state. **********Investors say that dealing with the aftermath of the Bennett collapse has left them feeling angry, embarrassed, betrayed and neglected. **********One investor from New York, a freelance writer in his 60's who spoke on the condition that his name not appear in print, said he had neglected his work for the last year to cope with the Bennett mess. ''To lose the money is bad enough, terrible,'' he said, ''but then to chase after all the paperwork, try to network with others to try to find out what was going on -- it took up an enormous amount of time that could have gone to business, or just to enjoying life.'' **********LARGE-SCALE pyramid schemes, in which early investors are paid off by later victims' money, appear to be on the rise. Investors lost almost $500 million  investing in bonds and notes sold by Towers Financial, a failed bill-collection agency run by Steven Hoffenberg, who was briefly publisher of The New York Post. Mr. Hoffenberg was recently sentenced to 20 years in prison. **********In other recent cases, the S.E.C. has accused the Better Life Club of Washington of preying on low- and middle-income investors who lost about $50 million, and regulators have called the First Interregional companies in New Jersey the ''Baby Bennett'' case because it, too, involved equipment leases. **********Ponzi schemes do not generally hurt big insurance companies, banks, government agencies or even the overall securities markets. The victims are usually individuals, and they often suffer huge losses. ''When pyramid schemes collapse, the people at the bottom tend to lose everything,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''That is much closer to a street robbery'' than securities fraud, he added. **********And there are usually many secondary victims: children for whom there will be no college; spouses for whom there will be no retirement; communities, charities and legitimate businesses whose dreams were fed with money that may have been stolen. **********There were several such businesses in and around Syracuse, an economically depressed area for which the Bennetts once served as economic engine and beacon of hope. Among them was Vernon Downs. **********The race track, built deep in the countryside between Syracuse and Utica in 1953 when harness racing was a booming sport, is a pale gray oval three-quarters of a mile around, flanked on one side by gentle green hills and on the other by a sprawl of low white buildings that include an enclosed grandstand, a clubhouse and offices. Below these buildings is a series of stables that can hold almost 1,000 horses. **********During the 1960's and early 1970's, Vernon Downs boomed; on special nights, more than 10,000 people would show up and bet half a million dollars or more, and even an average night would find a crowd of well over 4,000. **********''I grew up here when it was lot of fun to come in and go to work,'' said Frank O. White Jr., 42, a soft-spoken and articulate man with light-brown hair and wire-rim glasses. Like his father before him, Mr. White is chief executive of Vernon Downs and the small public company that owns it, Mid-State Raceway Inc., whose stock is traded in the ''pink sheets'' listing of over-the-counter stocks; he has never worked anywhere else. **********But by 1980, Vernon Downs was in decline, as were all the harness racing tracks in the state. Gamblers were increasingly turning to the state-run lottery and to off-track betting parlors, which return relatively little money to the tracks. Attendance at the tracks plunged, and so did the amount of money bet. **********Fortunately, the situation was not dire, Mr. White said last week in his cozy office overlooking the track. Vernon Downs had no debt and had invested money during its glory days, so that investment earnings helped cover operating shortfalls. **********In 1992, when Mr. Bennett bought a controlling interest in the track from three of the founders, including his father, ''Pat was like the salvation, the answer to getting the industry going again,'' Mr. White said. ''He was very aggressive, a good marketer, and he knew a lot of people in the industry.'' **********He was also a high roller by Vernon Downs standards; Mr. White said that anyone who bet $3,000 a night was a big bettor at his track. **********At first, the new marketing plans all seemed to be working. Mr. Bennett also came up with the idea of building a nice hotel on the track's grounds, a plan that became even more attractive when the Oneida Indian Nation announced it was opening a casino less than five miles away. **********The track leased land to a partnership controlled by Pat and Gwen Bennett. The Bennett companies paid to build the Comfort Suites hotel, which opened in 1994 and was the first hotel to feature betting not just in the lobby but in the rooms as well, Mr. White said. **********Mr. Bennett also promoted the idea of corporate sponsors for special races. Such sponsorships eventually brought hundreds of thousands of dollars into the track's coffers. What Mr. White did not realize at the time, he said, was that the sponsors were affiliates of Mr. Bennett's. **********Looking back, Mr. White said, perhaps he should have realized something was wrong. ''There were always rumors about where all this money was coming from -- comments were made, but you didn't really take credence in them,'' he recalled. ''After all, they were the business of the year in Syracuse in 1994, one of the fastest-growing companies in America.'' **********But according to a lawsuit filed in the Utica Bankruptcy Court by Mr. Breeden, the money Mr. Bennett used to buy the race track stock was not really his; it was taken from various Bennett company accounts, the suit said. And almost everything owned by various members of the Bennett clan -- including Pat's brother Michael and his parents, Edmund and Kathleen -- was paid for with company money but ended up in the family's name, the trustee says. Among the family's onetime possessions were yachts, a gambling riverboat called the Speculator and a series of hotels and motels. **********BY late 1995, the Bennett empire was starting to crack. The S.E.C. had intensified its investigation of the company, which had been selling hundreds of millions of dollars of unregistered securities that the company said were backed by leases. Some of these leases were fakes, Mr. Breeden said; others were real, but were sold to as many as seven different investors. **********Even worse, the pyramid had gotten so big that it was imploding, Mr. Breeden said. Although the company was getting $13 million a month in lease payments, it owed investors $30 million a month. The only way to cover the shortfall, he said, was to sell a lot more phony securities or to raise cash by selling assets. Patrick Bennett dumped  stock investments and other holdings at cut-rate prices, the trustee contends. **********His Vernon Downs holdings may have presented a particular problem because, if he were to be convicted of a crime, state gaming regulators would probably force him out of the business. **********In December, Mr. Bennett transferred his Vernon Downs stock to a company controlled by his wife; she signed a $1.9 million promissory note. Mr. Bennett then sold that note to a longtime business associate from Long Island named Neil Wager. **********Three months later, the S.E.C. filed a civil suit against the Bennett companies, the United States Attorney in Manhattan charged Mr. Bennett with securities fraud and perjury and the Bennett companies sought bankruptcy protection in Utica. **********It was not until the end of April that Mr. Bennett met with Mr. White to tell him that the stock had been transferred to his wife. Though Mr. White knew Mrs. Bennett -- ''we talked, passed pleasantries,'' as he put it -- she had not been directly involved in the track. **********Mr. Bennett suggested that Mid-State's board invite his wife to their meetings, since she apparently owned 54 percent of the stock. But the board decided against it. **********Why? ''The integrity issue,'' Mr. White said. ''If the sport doesn't have integrity, it will vanish. If even the perception is that there isn't integrity, it will hurt -- that's the bottom line.'' That perception could come, he said, from any indication that the Bennetts might be actively involved in the track. **********The Bennetts took it personally ''that the track had to distance itself from their situation,'' said James Moran, the track announcer and publicity director, who has worked at Vernon Downs since 1962. **********''That's how the feud began,'' he said **********IT would take a hard heart to blame Gwen Bennett for taking it personally. She says that the allegations about the Bennett companies are too complicated for her to understand, but that they have destroyed her family. ''They make my husband out to be a crook, but I believe in him,'' she said, adding that she does not think any investor will end up losing money. **********A friendly and outspoken woman, Mrs. Bennett looks far younger than her 38 years. She still wears a large diamond ring and pendant but her clothes are not fancy; she describes her style as ''Casual Corner, $99.'' After eight years of staying home with her two young sons, she has gone back to work to support her family, running the Winner's  Circle restaurant at the Comfort Suites hotel. Like almost all of the family's assets, the hotel will probably end up in the hands of the bankruptcy trustee or other creditors. **********Mrs. Bennett said she had always been interested in the track, had concerns about how it was being run and wanted her husband to sell his interest to her. How was she going to pay off the note? Dividends on the stock, she says vaguely. (The company's last dividend payment, in 1994, was 10 cents a share; Mrs. Bennett owns 135,600 shares.) **********Why does a woman with so many problems want to get control of a money-losing race track? Her opponents have speculated that she wants to insure that she has work if her husband loses everything. ''I think she's holding on in the hopes that some white knight will come and rescue her, but we don't think she's very realistic, or has very much business acumen,'' said Ronald M. Terenzi, a lawyer with Berkman Henoch Peterson & Peddy in Garden City, N.Y., which represents Mr. Wager, the note holder. **********Mrs. Bennett says, however, that she is in the fight not for herself, but for the horsemen and the community. And she denies that her husband put her up to it. ''Anybody that knows me,'' she said, ''knows this is really me.'' **********During the summer of 1996, the track's troubles mounted. Although attendance rose, the amount bet continued to drop, and Patrick Bennett's corporate sponsorships had evaporated. Almost $50,000 was unaccounted for because of problems at the hotel betting operation, Mr. White said. **********The company's auditors, Coopers & Lybrand, had quit abruptly. (Mr. Breeden, the bankruptcy trustee, was until recently a partner there.) Because of the Bennett involvement, Mr. White said, it took him a month and many rejections before he could find new accountants. **********Meanwhile, Mrs. Bennett said, she had lost all confidence in Mr. White and the rest of the board after she heard they planned to borrow money without, in her view, a plan to pay it back. She decided to nominate her own slate of directors, including Robert McSweeney, the manager of the Comfort Suites, and Jeremiah Law, owner of the Squat and Gobble restaurant, where she was working as a waitress when she met Mr. Bennett. **********Now it was Mr. White's turn to be offended. The only qualifications of the nominees ''appear to be their past affiliations with and loyalty to you and your husband,'' he wrote in a letter to her. **********''The board's fiduciary duty to all shareholders precludes endorsement of unqualified candidates,'' the letter continued. **********The matter came to a head at a special shareholders meeting in January, which was attended by Pat and Gwen Bennett, a fact that made the Syracuse newspapers. Mr. Bennett may have tipped things over the edge when he questioned Mr. White about the company's pension plan; the Federal Department of Labor has accused Mr. Bennett of mishandling the Bennett companies' plans, a charge he has denied. **********''Our directors wanted to kill him,'' Mr. White said. ''He had the gall to get up and question our integrity.'' **********Mr. Wager, the Long Island businessman, also turned up with his own slate of candidates. One of them, a businessman from Muscle Shoals, Ala., was elected, along with Mrs. Bennett's candidates. But the board promptly moved to foil the Bennetts by expanding the number of directors to 12 and reappointing the three members defeated in the election. **********AFTERWARD, the lawsuits started flying. Mrs. Bennett, who has four more candidates she wants on the board, has sued in State Supreme Court in Albany to force the Vernon Downs directors to schedule another election. Mr. Breeden, the bankruptcy trustee, has sued in Bankruptcy Court in Utica to get control of the shares he says were really paid for by the Bennett investors. And last month, Mr. Wager sued Mrs. Bennett in Supreme Court in Mineola, N.Y., on Long Island, saying that because she has defaulted on her note, the Vernon Downs shares really belong to him. **********The race track remains in a financial bind. The Oneida County government has offered to lend the track money to preserve jobs, but not until the ownership issues are resolved. Mr. White says no one will lend the track money as long as the Bennetts are involved, and Mrs. Bennett says she can  bring in local investors, but not until the current management is out. **********Although the people in this drama remain angry and determined to prevail, there is also a note of regret and nostalgia in their voices. **********Mr. Breeden, sitting in the Bennetts' old offices in Syracuse and listening to the anguish of thousands of investors desperate for money, thinks about how much better things would be if the brokers flogging Bennett securities had been required to notify his old agency, the S.E.C., about their activities. ''I could have put a rule in place had I understood the problem, so it's a little frustrating,'' he said. **********Mr. White wonders if he should have gone into another business, one that was growing, not declining. ''I look at what Tiger Woods has done for golf and I think about things that are on the rise,'' he said. ''When I was younger, I thought I could turn it around.'' **********And Mrs. Bennett says she is determined to wear a happy face in public, but sounds sad. ''I wish for the days when we were entertaining our friends,'' she said, ''going to Vernon Downs and and watching the beautiful horses race.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/24/business/paid-notice-deaths-deep-anthony-peter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DEEP, ANTHONY PETER", "print_headline": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DEEP, ANTHONY PETER", "body_text": " **********DEEP-Anthony Peter, 73.

If you haven't done it lately, review your mutual fund portfolio and discard inappropriate, redundant or poor-performing funds. **********How many funds is too many? That varies, but for a stock portfolio, Ms. Scott describes a five-fund model: a large-capitalization domestic stock fund, a small-cap domestic stock fund, an international large-stock fund, an emerging markets fund and perhaps a midcap stock fund. **********To create a complete portfolio, add an intermediate-term Government bond fund or a single-state municipal bond fund, maybe a high-yielding junk bond fund and probably a money market fund. Doing all that would bring the total to eight funds. Choose many more and you will be buried in reports and tax statements, spend too much time tracking the funds and pay for unnecessary duplication of holdings, Ms. Scott warns. **********If you have too many funds, extricate yourself from the thicket carefully, she continues. Decide which funds to keep based in part on your overall asset allocation target. Then look at which funds have the best long-term performance prospects and the best coverage of an investment category. As you prune, add the money harvested to these funds to remain fully invested. **********When you own funds with duplicate coverage and similar performance, first sell the ones in tax-deferred accounts, since that won't create any tax burden. Funds in which you have sizable gains in taxable accounts are more problematic, but don't hold onto subpar performers just to avoid incurring taxes. Eventually, a better performer should more than compensate for any initial tax payment. **********Consider taking losses to offset such gains. For example, if you have losses in a fund that you want to continue holding, sell shares and then repurchase them after 30 days. (If you repurchase shares immediately, the tax loss will be deferred until the second block of shares is sold.) **********Ms. Scott advises holding onto funds that are marginal performers if they have sizable gains, but says you should be prepared to sell them if the opportunity arises. That might occur if you have an offsetting loss in your portfolio, or if you are in a particularly low tax bracket one year. Otherwise, use the fund for withdrawals -- and don't reinvest dividends. **********Investors who want to own shares in only a few funds should consider a low-cost index fund, Ms. Scott says. Finally, fight the urge to invest in a new fund unless it covers new ground and can play a meaningful part in your portfolio, she advises. **********Advice on Rollovers **********T. Rowe Price Associates has started a service to help investors roll over their company retirement assets into individual retirement accounts. Investors complete a questionnaire, and Price then recommends an asset allocation and appropriate funds in its family. Representatives also oversee the rollover. The service carries a one-time charge of $100, which is refunded if the money is invested with Price. The rollover advice kit is available by calling (800) 472-5000. **********New Funds **********The latest entrant in the index market is Strong Funds. Its new Strong Index 500 fund aims to approximate the returns of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by investing in a limited partnership managed by Barclays Global Fund Advisors, which in turn buys the securities in the index. The minimum investment is $2,500.

W. Botha personally ordered the bombing that destroyed the South African Council of Churches headquarters in 1988. **********The testimony comes from the highest-ranking official to apply for amnesty, Adriaan Vlok, former Minister of Law and Order. In the 84-page document he submitted to the commission, Mr. Vlok said the former President had told him to destroy the headquarters, called Khotso House, because it had become a ''house of evil.'' **********The Johannesburg headquarters was virtually demolished in June 1988 by an explosion that slightly injured 23 people. Mr. Vlok said Mr. Botha congratulated him later on a job well done. **********The testimony is the first to be made public that directly links the former President to acts of terror.  The revelations represent a major step for the Truth Commission, which was set up to uncover as much as possible about this country's brutal past. In exchange for full disclosure, the commission can offer amnesty from both civil and criminal prosecutions. **********In recent years, many parliamentary hearings, judicial inquiries, criminal prosecutions and private lawsuits have explored the violent crimes of the apartheid era. But no verdict has laid culpability directly at the feet of high-level government officials. **********Mr. Vlok's submission was handed  to the commission before the May 10 deadline for amnesty applications, but it was not made public until today when a Cape Town newspaper, The Cape Times, published excerpts from a copy it had obtained. **********In his application, Mr. Vlok said  Mr. Botha had asked him to destroy  the headquarters of the Council of Churches because the group was sheltering anti-apartheid activists. **********Mr. Vlok quoted Mr. Botha as saying: ''I have done everything possible to persuade them to come to their senses but nothing helps. We cannot act against the people. You must render that building of theirs unusable . . . Whatever you do, you must make sure that nobody is killed.'' **********The six-story Khotso House -- the name means House of Peace in the Sotho language -- had become a symbol of nonviolent resistance to apartheid. The explosion was one of a series of attacks on buildings housing anti-apartheid and civil rights groups, unions and church organizations. **********In his application, Mr. Vlok also asked for amnesty for his role in planning the bombing of a trade union headquarters in 1987, for defaming an anti-apartheid activist by falsely accusing her of a taking part in the Khotso House bombing and for engaging in efforts to place ''small explosive devices'' in movie houses that wanted to show the film ''Cry Freedom,'' which told the story of Steve Biko, the black nationalist leader. **********The application would normally not have been made public until Mr. Vlok was called to testify at an amnesty hearing. The Truth Commission issued a statement saying it was investigating whether any of its members had leaked information about Mr. Vlok's application. The statement also said that the deputy chairman of the commission, Alex Boraine, had already called Mr. Vlok to apologize in the event that it was responsible. **********Mr. Vlok said he was angry that his application had been made public prematurely but accepted the commission's apology. **********''I did not leak it and my attorney did not leak it.'' Mr. Vlok told the South African Press Association. **********Mr. Botha, 81, who was South Africa's head of state from 1978 to 1989, when he suffered a stroke, has been in retirement since then, living on a remote farm north of Cape Town. Mr. Botha, known for his irascible temper and imperious ways, warned as the Truth Commission was being created in 1995 that he would not seek amnesty or have anything to do with the panel. **********But after the chairman of the commission, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, visited him last year, he agreed to answer a list of written questions. He has not done so yet. Efforts to reach him today were unsuccessful. **********The Truth Commission was intended as a sort of compromise, a two-year inquiry intended to help put the past to rest without expensive and politically divisive trials. It is expected to issue a report on its findings next March. **********But it has had trouble reaching into the upper echelons of the former government. Most of those who have come forward to apply for amnesty are lower-  and mid-level security officers, many of whom believe they were following high-level orders but who offered no proof. Mr. Vlok, however, was a member of the National Party Government's inner circle. **********In recent weeks, the commission has come under harsh criticism from Mr. Botha's successor, F. W. de Klerk, who was President until the country's first election open to all races in 1994. Mr. de Klerk, who still heads the largely white-supported National Party, has accused the commission of being biased against him and has demanded an apology from Archbishop Tutu for remarks he made last month after Mr. de Klerk testified before the commission. **********Mr. de Klerk has maintained that torture, murder and terrorist acts were never government policy and that he had no reason to seek amnesty. At a recent commission hearing, he said he ''was as surprised as anyone else'' at the scope of the killings and torture that had been uncovered so far. **********This prompted Mr. Tutu to say he found Mr. de Klerk's statements hard to believe. **********On Thursday Mr. de Klerk turned to the courts, asking them to stop the Archbishop from making further statements that would harm Mr. de Klerk's ''credibility, impartiality or integrity.'' The suit also asks the courts to find Mr. Boraine, who similarly criticized Mr. de Klerk, unfit for his job with the commission. A hearing is scheduled for Aug. 26. **********In recalling the events surrounding the bombing of Khotso House,  Mr. Vlok said Mr. Botha had congratulated him on the success of the operation at a meeting of the State Security Council, a group that convened regularly to discuss security issues and was considered even more important than the Cabinet. **********Whether Mr. de Klerk was a member of that group at the time is not a matter of public record."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/16/business/columbia-hca-cites-talks-with-potential-buyers.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1997-08-16", "snippet": "Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp president Jack Bovender says company has received expressions of interest from number of potential buyers of portions of business, but it currently is interested only in selling its home care operations; adds company i...", "word_count": 636, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Columbia/HCA Cites Talks With Potential Buyers", "print_headline": "Columbia/HCA Cites Talks With Potential Buyers", "body_text": " **********The Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation has received expressions of interest from a number of potential buyers of portions of its business, but it currently is interested only in selling its home care operations, the president of the company said yesterday. **********In an interview, Jack Bovender, the president and chief operating officer of Columbia, said that the company was not currently negotiating with any of the potential bidders, who have emerged in the weeks since Thomas F. Frist Jr. was named as chairman and chief executive of Columbia, succeeding Richard L. Scott, the company's co-founder. **********''It's premature,'' Mr. Bovender said of the expressions of interest by potential bidders. ''People are starting to assume that we have this elaborate game plan about what we are going to do, and that is not true.'' **********Columbia, which has been struggling under the weight of an unfolding criminal investigation, announced last week that it planned to sell its home health care division, apparently helping to spark the interest in other portions of the company. **********Mr. Bovender said that while Columbia might later determine that there were portions of the company top executives wanted to sell or that the company had received an offer too good to refuse, the executives simply had not developed enough information to make such decisions. **********''There's nothing wrong with people sending a letter saying they are interested in something,'' Mr. Bovender said, ''but if they think it is going to create immediate interest, it's not.'' **********He added that Columbia itself was not for sale. **********Among the companies that have approached Columbia about acquiring some portions of it is HealthSouth, which operates rehabilitation hospitals and outpatient surgery centers. **********HealthSouth's interest, which was first reported in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, is focused on not only the rehabilitation and outpatient business, but also its diagnostic unit and occupational clinics. **********In an interview, Richard Scrushy, the chairman and chief executive of HealthSouth, said that he had let Dr. Frist know of his interest, but that no negotiations had yet ensued. **********''All I did was let him know I was interested,'' he said. ''They said they didn't know what they were going to do, and if they did they would let me know. There is nothing else to it, period.'' **********Mr. Scrushy said that his company was not interested in purchasing Columbia's acute care hospitals or home health care business. The company had approached Columbia last month with a tentative offer of $45 a share, but received no response and has since withdrawn its indication of interest. **********Columbia shares were trading in the low $40's last February, before the first indications of the Government's interest in the company emerged. But as disclosures of the investigations and other issues emerged, the stock lost about 25 percent of its value, closing yesterday at $32.375 a share, up $1.0625, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********HealthSouth investors also reacted positively to the news of that company's efforts to buy portions of Columbia. The shares rose as much as $1.25 a share yesterday, before closing at $23.9375, up 31.25 cents. **********In the interview, Mr. Bovender said that Columbia's home health care division had attracted expressions of interest from a number of other health care companies in the field. But he said that there were as yet no formal offers and no negotiations. **********The decision to sell the home health care division was part of a corporatewide reorganization of Columbia, which the new management adopted as part of a strategy to deal with Government concerns. **********Portions of the Federal investigation involve the home health care business, in particular whether the company's hospitals improperly shifted costs to the home health care operations in order to increase total reimbursement under complex Medicare policies. **********Problems with the company's cost reports have led to the indictments of three Columbia executives in Florida on charges of fraud. A Federal prosecutor said earlier this week that more indictments were likely."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/09/business/local-touches-and-low-prices-pay-off-for-applebee-s.html": {"writer_name": "Dana Canedy", "pub_date": "1997-05-09", "snippet": "Applebee's International Inc has become nation's largest and fastest-growing casual-dining chain in terms of number of stores and is among largest and fastest growing in revenue and earnings; Applebee has sales of $1.5 billion and operates more th...", "word_count": 1402, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Local Touches and Low Prices Pay Off for Applebee's", "print_headline": "Local Touches and Low Prices Pay Off for Applebee's", "body_text": " **********Planet Hollywood names drinks after Demi Moore and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. Hard Rock Cafe displays glitzy memorabilia like Billy Joel's old piano. At the Applebee's Neighborhood Bar and Grill in this suburb of Kansas City, the closest things to celebrity memorabilia are the autographed sneakers of Bill Elliott, a former basketball star at nearby Olathe South High School. **********And while there are no celebrity pianos, a used fire hose from the local fire department hangs on the wall. **********At Applebee's restaurants nationwide, the menu, too, has a hometown feel, featuring ''neighborhood specialties'' with local touches like chicken-fried steak in Texas and seafood gumbo in Boston. And if all that neighborhood feeling is not enough, there is the price: The average bill is $8.50 a person, at least a dollar lower than at many competing chains in the ''casual dining'' market -- including Chili's Grill and Bar, TGI Friday's and Olive Garden. **********The idea is to make the restaurants seem local, cozy and affordable. And so far it has worked. Planet Hollywood and Hard Rock Cafe may get a lot more attention, but Applebee's -- taking a far different, less citified approach -- has become the nation's largest and fastest-growing casual-dining chain in terms of number of stores and is among the largest and fastest growing in revenue and earnings. Today, Applebee's International Inc. has sales of $1.5 billion and operates more than 840 restaurants in 45 states, primarily in towns and sprawling suburbs in the Midwest and South. **********Undaunted by all the competitors in this corner of the restaurant market, Applebee's plans to double in size within five years, opening at least 135 restaurants this year alone. That means moving into new, sometimes more urban terrain, including the New York metropolitan area. **********Applebee's is also rolling out a new chain of Tex-Mex restaurants, called Rio Bravo Cantina. In addition to the 38 restaurants it now operates, the company plans to add 27 this year. Rio Bravo, which operates in the Southeast and Midwest, competes with chains like Chi Chi's and El Torito, both units of Family Restaurants Inc. **********But continued growth will not come as easily. Even as Applebee's expands, sales at its restaurants open more than a year have declined or been flat in recent years. **********Then there is the question of the company's relationship with its largest franchise owner, Apple South Inc. of Madison, Ga., whose chief executive tried to take over Applebee's in 1994 and who is opening a chain of Mexican restaurants that competes with Rio Bravo in some markets. **********Indeed, while a consensus of 16 analysts polled by the First Call research firm rates the company's stock a buy, Applebee's shares have been up and down since reaching a high of $31 in January. They were unchanged yesterday at $25.75. **********Applebee's -- the name was chosen because it sounded apple pie American -- was created in Atlanta in 1980 by Bill and T. J. Palmer, a husband and wife who sold it to W. R. Grace three years later. Abe J. Gustin Jr., now chairman and co-chief executive, and a partner who has since retired became franchise owners in 1986 and bought what had become a 41-restaurant chain in 1988. **********In the late 1970's, Mr. Gustin had been dismissed as national sales director of the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company after he and several other executives were investigated by the Government on accusations of kickbacks and price-fixing. Although he was never charged with a crime, ''I felt if I was going to get back to work, it would have to be as an entrepreneur,'' Mr. Gustin said. **********Now, at 62, he is handing off Applebee's leadership to Lloyd L. Hill, a former president of Kimberly Quality Care, a health care company in Boston. Mr. Hill has no previous restaurant experience but was brought in to transform Applebee's entrepreneurial culture into a more corporate one. **********Applebee's is known for both its bite-size ''riblets'' and ever-changing menu. A popular new dish called ''N'Awlins Skillet'' -- a mix of grilled chicken, smoked sausage and sauteed shrimp, onions and bell peppers on a bed of rice -- is one of several new entrees served on skillets and priced as low as $6.99. **********The mozzarella sticks and tequila-lime chicken notwithstanding, customers say they also like the mix of the raised bar in the middle of the restaurants and the family-style booths, where children are given crayons and balloons. **********''It's a kind of Friday's-type atmosphere,'' said Kristina Quick, holding her 4-month-old daughter, Katelyn, at an Applebee's in Kansas City, Kan. ''I mean it's casual enough that the baby can scream.'' **********Her husband, Matthew, added, ''They have a pretty affordable brunch, and I'm a chicken wings fan, and I would rather not take my wife and daughter to a bar for chicken wings.'' **********Applebee's, based in Overland Park, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City, has capitalized on health-conscious consumers seeking alternatives to fast food at a time when some older chains' concepts have gone stale for many diners. Darden Restaurants Inc., for example, is closing about 50 unprofitable Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurants. **********By contrast, Applebee's has reported several years of revenue and income growth, including a 23 percent increase in sales and a 30 percent jump in earnings last year. In the most recent quarter, ended March 30, sales increased 22 percent, and earnings grew 30 percent, the company announced this week. **********Its expansion reached New York City last week with the opening of a restaurant in Bayside, Queens, to be followed in the next few years by more restaurants in Queens and in Brooklyn. The company also has restaurants on Long Island, including one that opened in October in New Hyde Park, and on Staten Island, including one at the Staten Island Mall. **********In Westchester County, Applebee's has a restaurant in Mamaroneck and opened one last month in Mount Kisco. And in New Jersey, it has several restaurants, including in Paramus, Piscataway and Woodbridge. **********In the growth strategy of the company, its franchise system is seen as one of its greatest strengths. In a market dominated by corporate-run chains, like Red Lobster, Ruby Tuesday and Chili's, 80 percent of Applebee's restaurants are operated by franchise owners whose fees -- an initial investment of about $35,000 and 4 percent of monthly gross sales -- pay for research and development, staff training and advertising. That is in addition to the $1.2 million investment to build the restaurant, which does not include the price of land. **********The company says the franchise system provides it with entrepreneurs who have a keen understanding of their markets, everything from which local athletes' baseball bats to hang on restaurant walls to which dishes sell well at nearby mom-and-pop restaurants. **********''In our restaurants we had crab soup for a while, which was a very popular item in Maryland,'' said Harry T. Rose, who owns six restaurants in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland and plans to open five this year. **********Mr. Gustin, the chairman, said he never expected the chain to grow to its current size, ''but it just kind of continued to explode and grow.'' **********Yet Applebee's is not without its problems. Analysts note that the casual-dining market is becoming saturated. And Even as Applebee's expands, sales at its restaurants open at least a year declined in 1995 and were flat last year. The company, though, says it is shortsighted to focus on sales at those restaurants. This is happening, the company says, at a time when it is deliberately cutting into revenue of existing restaurants by opening others nearby in an attempt to dominate the market. **********There is also the question of the company's relationship with its largest franchise owner, Apple South, a public company that operates 354 restaurants, including 238 Applebee's. Tom E. DuPree Jr., Apple South's chief executive, once tried to take over Applebee's. And rather than buy into the Rio Bravo concept, he has invested in a rival chain called Don Pablo's Mexican Kitchen. Both Mr. Gustin and Mr. DuPree maintain, however, that relations between the companies are fine, and they note that Applebee's other franchise owners operate other types of restaurants as well. **********What the company cannot so easily dismiss, however, is the tougher competition it will face in larger cities. By operating in small markets, Applebee's benefits from lower real estate, construction and labor costs, which helps it, in turn, offer entrees at competitive prices. **********But ''when they get into head-to-head competition with people like Friday's,'' said John Gilbert, vice president of marketing for Friday's, ''they will struggle.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/18/business/company-briefs-235466.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-01-18", "snippet": "Electronic Data Systems Corp wins $42-million contract from US Postal Service to manage computer technology (S)", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company Briefs", "print_headline": "Company Briefs", "body_text": " **********ELECTRONIC DATA SYSTEMS CORP.,  Plano, Tex., said it had won a three-year contract worth $42 million from the U.S. Postal Service to manage and monitor its computer technology. **********HEALTHSOUTH CORP.,  Birmingham, Ala., said it would split its common stock 2 for 1.

Unless there was a golf course in the vicinity, he would rush from nation to nation, from summit meeting to state visit, in long grueling days without a moment's leisure. **********But weeks after his re-election in November, Mr. Clinton showed signs of easing his pace when he snorkled in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef during a visit to Australia. Then, just after New Year's, he lazed in the Virgin Islands. And he had been planning to play golf with a pro, Greg Norman, in Florida in March when he took the late-night stumble in Mr. Norman's walled compound that led to his knee surgery. **********Now having made the progression from wheelchair to crutches to cane to walking stiffly, but unencumbered, Mr. Clinton is risking playfulness once more. **********He stopped in this European playground of sparkling bay, soaring sandstone cathedral and late night cafes this weekend on his way to the NATO summit meeting in Madrid, where the alliance will admit new members from the former Warsaw Pact. Mr. Clinton is the guest here of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain, who keep a summer palace nearby. **********This afternoon, the President, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, set out with the King and his wife on the royal couple's sleek white yacht, Fortuna, barreling off into the Mediterranean with Juan Carlos at the wheel. Jose Maria Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister, and his wife also joined the group. **********The scene quickly became slightly surreal. Queen Sofia playfully snapped camera shots of the photographers on land taking pictures of the Clintons and of her. Three small speedboats packed with American Secret Service agents traveled with the yacht -- one in front, two trailing. And a boat named Sinatra filled with American reporters trailed along farther behind. **********When the small flotilla passed alongside the Hue City, an Aegis-class cruiser docked in the harbor, American sailors lining the railing to see the Commander in Chief were called to attention and saluted. Mr. Clinton smartly returned the salute  and waved to the crew. **********Though a local English-language newspaper could not resist one article about the Senate hearings on campaign finance practices, which are about to open, the Clintons seemed as relaxed as the reams of tourists who cram Majorca's yachting ports and multicolored high-rise hotels. The yachters stayed on the seas for six hours, anchoring for a long time outside the small port town of Punto Andraitx, away from paparazzi and curious crowds. **********Mr. Clinton also proved an enthusiastic sightseer on this visit. On Saturday, just off an overnight flight from Washington on Air Force One and squired by the King, he toured Bellver Castle, a 14th-century fortress surrounded by a moat that features a panoramic view over the harbor and the surrounding city. The motorcade to the castle stretched 30 cars long. **********The President displayed his interest in architecture by pointing out to reporters some of the nuances of the castle. ''I've never seen anything like this before,'' he said. ''Two different architectual styles on two different floors. And round. Very rare, Gothic. Some of it is Romanesque, though. I've never seen anything like it.'' **********Reminded that the fortress was once a prison, he said, ''Almost makes you want to go to jail out here doesn't it?'' Mrs. Clinton laughed. **********The couple were soon joined by  Chelsea, who is touring Europe this summer after her high school graduation. After several hours in their quarters in the Almudaina Palace, a 10th-century Moorish castle with watchtowers and ramparts, the Clintons and a young woman traveling with Chelsea walked across a cobbled road to tour the Gothic cathedral that towers over the city. **********Late Saturday night, the Clintons startled vacationers by stopping for coffee and dessert under the outdoor awnings of a cafe named Cappuccino, and the Secret Service placed a phalanx of agents along the sidewalk outside the President's table. **********As the other diners applauded, the restaurateur presented Mr. Clinton with a saxophone to inspect.

But the current account \u2014 the overall measure of trade in goods and services \u2014 remained in deficit due to low tourism revenue.

Boyle, as executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Gov. George E. Pataki has revived talk about breaking up the sprawling agency that operates the road, rail and air gateways to the region. **********For the many people who own a piece of the Port Authority's $5.5 billion in outstanding debt, that raises the inevitable question: How could such a major restructuring affect the value of their bonds? **********History can provide little guidance, Port Authority officials and bond analysts said, because no multistate agency has disbanded in the many decades that Congress has allowed their creation. **********But history aside, bondholders should relax, the experts said. Dissolving the agency would require far more political cooperation and willpower than currently exists, they said. And a major downsizing of the Port Authority through, say, the divestiture of its airports, would face huge financial and political obstacles. **********Even if there were a huge restructuring of the agency, the political pressure from Wall Street, major institutional investors and elected officials to protect bondholders' interests would be overwhelming. **********''My feeling is that there is no way they could split it up without bondholders being covered, because it would be so politically unpopular,'' said Andrea Bozzo, managing director of Fitch Investor Services. Fitch, a credit rating agency, has not changed the bonds' rating or put a watch on them since the recent developments, she added. **********Nevertheless, some bondholders may view Mr. Pataki's recent statements with concern. He has echoed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's complaints that the agency favors New Jersey, does a poor job of running John F. Kennedy International and La Guardia airports and ought to reduce its real estate holdings. Indeed, Mr. Pataki told Crain's New York Business recently, ''In my mind, it is still an open question whether the Port Authority is salvageable.'' **********Mr. Pataki has made the issue more real by asking Mr. Boyle to study how to make the Port Authority work more efficiently, and, if that is deemed impossible, to propose ways to restructure it. **********Aides to both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Boyle said the new executive director's primary goal was to make the agency succeed, not kill it. ''The Governor sent him in here with the mission to see what it would take and how to go about making this place work,'' said Mark Hatfield, director of communications for the Port Authority. **********Making any changes would be highly complicated because the agency is the child of two states. Dissolving it would require the consent of both states' Governors and Legislatures. And though Mr. Pataki is raising the idea, there is little interest in Trenton. **********The agency has sold assets, as it did last year with the Vista Hotel and is considering doing now with the World Trade Center. Because all Port Authority revenues go into a general fund, the sale of a few properties does not affect the agency's ability to repay bondholders, analysts said. **********But what if the Port Authority were to reduce significantly its revenue stream by divesting itself of some big assets, like the airports? Many experts question whether there are even any takers for such properties, and if there were, whether the public would stand for privatizing something as important as a leading airport. **********Nothing in the bonds' covenants prevents such sales, however. And bondholders may not be fully reassured by the statements of Port Authority officials that any sale proceeds must be used to redeem agency bonds or to invest in new projects whose revenues could be pledged to bondholders. **********FOR instance, bondholders often get irked if their bonds are recalled early, said Jim Lynch, publisher of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory report. In such cases, investors lose a stream of income they had assumed would be there, and though they can buy another bond with the redemption proceeds, they may not find one as much to their liking as the one recalled. And even if bonds are not redeemed, bondholders who liked the idea of having their Port Authority investments backed up with revenues from, say, airports, might feel less secure if the revenues came from something else, like a real estate development. **********All the talk about restructuring the Port Authority has not affected the sale of its bonds, judging by a recent $300 million offering in January. Mr. Lynch said those bonds had fluctuated with the market, but not because of Mr. Pataki's remarks. **********That may change if Mr. Boyle urges Mr. Pataki to seek an agency overhaul, but for the moment many analysts are unperturbed. Mr. Lynch said major institutional investors still consider Port Authority bonds a good buy and do not pay much attention to the griping of politicians. **********''They know if the state were to try an end run, selling certain assets that are key to providing revenues, the state would be in court in a flash,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/03/business/worldbusiness/IHT-despite-global-financial-uncertainty-the-dollar.html": {"writer_name": "Carl Gewirtz", "pub_date": "1997-11-03", "snippet": "In a week marked by global flight to financial havens \u2014 notably U.S. government bonds \u2014 the dollar stood out only because it attracted so little interest. .Over the week, the dollar slipped 2.5 percent against the Deutsche mark, finishing a", "word_count": 3300, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Despite Global Financial Uncertainty, the Dollar Finds Few Takers", "print_headline": "Despite Global Financial Uncertainty, the Dollar Finds Few Takers", "body_text": " **********In a week marked by global flight to financial havens \u2014 notably U.S. government bonds \u2014 the dollar stood out only because it attracted so little interest. **********Over the week, the dollar slipped 2.5 percent against the Deutsche mark, finishing at 1.7250 DM.

Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said he believed a Fed rate increase remained unlikely, because the higher industrial production ''was accompanied by continued strong productivity gains, which helps contain inflation and also raises the Fed's speed limit.'' **********Mr. Harris said that a key determinant about inflationary pressures for the Fed would be the employment cost index for the third quarter, which is scheduled for release next Tuesday. Mr. Harris said he believed the index would register a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent to eight-tenths, considered a modest advance. **********The only Government economic data this week are the August trade balance figures, scheduled for release today, and initial unemployment claims on Thursday. Next week, a crop of statistics are due, including Government reports on September durable goods orders and the third-quarter gross domestic product. **********Rates at yesterday's weekly Treasury bill auction were mixed, with the range mostly in keeping with expectations or even a little higher. The average rate for a three-month bill was 4.96 percent, down two basis points from a week ago, while the average rate for the six-month bill was up 3 basis points, to 5.15 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********Kim Rupert, an economist with Standard & Poor's MMS, a San Francisco market research and analysis firm, said that bills were looking a little expensive yesterday, especially after recent volatility in the financial markets drove some investors from both the equity market and the long end of the yield curve to the relative safety of the bill sector. **********A scarcity of new bills also helped lift prices. But supply may work against the market in coming weeks and months. Ms. Rupert noted that there is considerable corporate supply in the pipeline, while the Treasury will be selling about $27 billion in two-  and five-year notes next week, followed in early November by about $38 billion in 3-year, 10-year and 30-year issues. **********The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills: **********(000 omitted in dollar figures)                     3-Mo.

Every other European country has asked the European Commission for permission as well, and are all expected to follow suit. **********But at least some of the callback entrepreneurs, who are all based in the United States, say the Europeans will never be able to collect. The customers may well be in France or Germany, but the service and the billing is carried out in places like Florida, New Jersey or Seattle. **********''I don't see how they will be able to track us,'' said Eric Doescher, director of marketing for International Kallback, a Seattle-based company that boasts 90,000 customers and $100 million in sales. **********Callback services, most of which are garage-sized start-ups, have soared in popularity and sophistication in the last several years. European government officials recently estimated that the industry sales were $500 million last year and would probably hit $1 billion in 1997. Even the AT&T Corporation, which fretted for years about the legality of callback services, recently jumped into the market. **********The key to callback services is a mischievously clever way of exploiting the huge spread between telephone rates in the United States, where heavy competition has brought prices down over the last decade, and the rates charged by state-controlled monopolies in most other countries. **********Callback services essentially allow callers in Europe to reverse the charges. A customer in Paris who wants to call Dallas, for example, begins by dialing an automated callback service in the United States.  The person hangs up as soon as the American phone rings, and the callback service dials the customer back moments later. The person then dials the number in Dallas, and the call is put through. **********The result: the call is billed at American rates rather than, say, those of France Telecom or Deutsche Telekom. The savings are so great, in fact, that a large percentage of customers dial through the American callback services to make calls within Europe. **********But now European governments want to subject customers of callback services to their value-added taxes, which vary by country but are sometimes above 20 percent. Until now, the companies have been exempt from these taxes because their operations and billing have been from the United States. **********European officials contend that they are just trying to create a level playing field, because customers who use traditional companies like France Telecom or Deutsche Telekom pay the value-added tax. **********''The European Union is only trying to make it so that everyone starts on the same footing,'' said a representative of France Telecom. **********With savings ranging from 50 to 80 percent, the callback services would still retain a competitive edge even with the taxes, although some customers might find the slight inconvenience less worthwhile. **********The European Union's new rules could also affect on-line services and Internet providers, because they apply to all telecommunication services that are used by customers within a European country. In theory, according to industry experts, a company in the United States that offers on-line shopping over the Internet or that sells information would be obligated to pay value-added taxes to the government of each customer's country. **********That raises difficult practical and legal issues, because the Internet dissolves national boundaries and allows people to surf at random between sites around the world. To collect sales taxes, governments would have to know which customers were buying goods or services from which overseas companies and then somehow collect the tax. **********That prospect already rankles some European experts. ''How can the European community take a U.S. company and tell them that you are now a German citizen and you have to pay us taxes?'' asked Thomas Ulrich, general manager of Bendig & Partners in Regensburg, Germany, which provides Internet services and markets callback services based in the United States. **********Collecting taxes from callback services may be more straightforward. Georg Hofer, general manager of Telepassport, which markets callback services in Frankfurt, said his company would make sure the taxes were paid if it had to. **********''We are still investigating it right now to see if it applies to us,'' Mr. Hofer said. ''But we are prepared to do it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/16/your-money/IHT-zimbabwe.html": {"writer_name": "Aline Sullivan", "pub_date": "1997-08-16", "snippet": "LIONS are more commonly associated with Zimbabwe than tigers.

The total, $6 billion, is still very small by the standards of developed markets \u2014 the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is capitalized at $283 billion, for example \u2014 but it makes Zimbabwe by far the most attractive market a region that is enjoying unprecedented growth. **********The 12 members of the Southern African Development Community all registered growth last year, eight of them at a rate of 5 percent or more. Such progress would be extraordinary anywhere, but it is astonishing in a region that until recently was torn apart by war. **********\"Africa used to be tarred with the same brush. If there were problems in one country investors would ignore the rest,\" said David Masters, senior analyst at the Boston office of Micropal, the London-based fund data company. **********\"But Southern Africa has changed, and now that people are waking up to the opportunities, there are going to be considerable inflows into the region over the next few years,\" he said. **********Zimbabwe is the region's most populous and prosperous country apart from South Africa and the obvious target for investors. It accounts for 0.5 percent of the assets of the 106 global emerging-market funds tracked from Micropal, up from 0.3 percent last year. That gives it the lion's, or tiger's, share of allocations to Southern Africa excluding South Africa, which rose to 0.7 percent of the funds' portfolios, up from 0.4 percent a year ago. **********Indeed, a number of funds dedicated to the region has sprung up in recent years. Morgan Stanley invests 21 percent of its $327 Africa Investment Fund Inc. in Zimbabwe. The fund, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, has gained 27.15 percent so far this year. A further 43.1 percent of its assets are invested in South Africa. **********Other funds that now invest heavily in Zimbabwe include: Alliance's Southern Africa fund, Barings' Simba Fund, the GT Africa Funds, the Merrill Lynch Middle East and Africa funds and Calvert New Africa. **********Raymond Goldblatt, Capetown-based manager of Fleming's $86 million New South Africa Fund, devotes virtually all the fund to South Africa and Zimbabwe. **********\"The Zimbabweans are managing their companies in environments of very high inflation [21.4 percent in the year to June 30] so their company earnings look very good,\" Mr. Goldblatt said. He favors the beverage hotels and leisure company Delta, the bank NMB and the building company Portholds. The New South Africa Fund has gained 21 percent so far this year. **********Investors in Africa and further afield bemoan what they perceive as a shortage of stocks in Zimbabwe, a common complaint in emerging markets. Not surprisingly, local institutions have an extremely low proportion, just 5 percent, of their investments in the stock market. **********\"There is not nearly enough to buy, and buying can be a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Mr. Goldblatt said. \"By the time you put through an order at 10 Zimbabwe dollars a share, you find that it has shot up to 11 dollars a share.\" **********The country's ambitious privatization program should help. \"The recent privatization of Dairy Boards of Zimbabwe Ltd. was a huge success and we expect the same from the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe and the Cotton Company of Zimbabwe later this year,\" said Simon Ried, a broker at Edwards & Co. in Harare. \"It is still very early days but all of this is very good news for us in this country.\" **********Shares in these three companies should be available to foreign investors by October, when exchange controls will be relaxed, at least for some offerings. By then, investing in Zimbabwe should be simply a matter of picking sectors and stocks. **********Agriculture, notably tobacco, is still the big earner, accounting for about 15 percent of gross domestic product last year after jumping almost 50 percent in local currency terms. Indeed, a prolonged dry season and resulting poor harvest in 1995 caused Zimbabwe's GDP growth to shrink to 3 percent, or about the current U.S. rate. One year and one good rainy season later, it shot up to 6 percent. **********The manufacturing sector is gaining fast, however. Analysts expect it to rise by 7 percent this year, thanks to improved consumer demand for beverages, tobacco and clothing. By next year manufacturing should be the largest contributor to growth. Manufacturing stocks should rise 48 percent next year in local currency and 32 percent in 1999, they predicted. **********The outlook for Zimbabwe's mining industry is equally rosy. Although the market remains depressed this year by low international metal prices, the Edwards & Co. analysts expect gains of 8 percent in 1998 after the Hartley Platinum mine comes on stream at the end of this year. \"The high level of exploration activity currently being undertaken provides a measure of excitement for this sector,\" they said. **********Aline Sullivan **********- **********- **********For more information, call: **********- **********FLEMING'S New South Africa Fund, 2721 794 7007. **********MORGAN STANLEY Africa Investment Fund Inc., 1 212 762 7600. **********MERRILL LYNCH Middle East Africa Funds, 1 212 449 1000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/18/world/south-koreans-vote-seeking-rescue-from-economic-crisis.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-12-18", "snippet": "South Koreans vote amid economic crisis to choose President to preside over far-reaching industrial overhaul; candidates, including front-runners, Kim Dae Jung and Lee Hoi Chang, seek to portray selves as reassuring figures able to lead nation to ...", "word_count": 922, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Koreans Vote, Seeking Rescue From Economic Crisis", "print_headline": "South Koreans Vote, Seeking Rescue From Economic Crisis", "body_text": " **********Voters began casting their ballots this morning for a new President to rescue this nation from its financial crisis and preside over a far-reaching industrial overhaul during the next five years. **********As the candidates finished their campaigning on Wednesday night, bellowing in hoarse voices to shoppers in the markets, the election came to be widely seen as a milestone in Korean history. **********It is a bit like the American Presidential election of 1932, during the Great Depression, and each candidate is trying to portray himself as a reassuring Roosevelt-like figure able to lead the country to economic recovery. **********The two leading candidates, Kim Dae Jung (pronounced kim-day-joong) and Lee Hoi Chang (pronounced ee-hweh-chahng), were neck and neck in opinion polls, but they come from very different backgrounds. Mr. Lee is a former judge and the epitome of the establishment, while Mr. Kim is a legendary democracy campaigner in Asia whom past South Korean Presidents repeatedly tried to kill. **********If Mr. Kim wins, it will be the first peaceful transfer of the presidency to the opposition party in modern Korean history. Just 10 years ago, when Mr. Kim was also running, the country was rife with rumors that his victory would provoke a military coup.

''I thank the public for reserving me until today, when the nation truly needs a strong and capable leader.'' **********Mr. Kim also warned that if Mr. Lee was elected, ''the nation will plunge into deeper crisis.'' **********Mr. Lee responded by suggesting that the financial markets would effectively punish Korea if it chose Mr. Kim. ''If a figure lacking credibility with the international community takes office, there would be a further exodus of our meager foreign capital,'' Mr. Lee declared, referring to Mr. Kim. **********Both Mr. Lee and Mr. Kim have lived in the United States and speak fairly good English, and each portrays himself as the international candidate with the ties to Washington that can help resolve the crisis. **********Both candidates now say they favor far-reaching economic changes in accordance with the International Monetary Fund's bailout of South Korea. **********Financial analysts said that the stock market would probably react better to a win by Mr. Lee, as he is regarded as more of a pro-business candidate, while Mr. Kim is seen as a populist who might be reluctant to close bankrupt companies and put people out of work. **********On the other hand, Mr. Kim has far more credibility with labor unions, and with the poor and disenfranchised. If Mr. Kim backs a far-reaching restructuring program, he may be able to do it more easily than anyone else. **********Mr. Lee is gambling that voters will be angry at the governing party but fearful of turning to the untested opposition at a moment of crisis, and he has spoken under the banner of ''stability against turmoil.'' **********''Since the economy is experiencing difficulties and the country is unstable, the entire nation must be led by a responsible and stable political force,'' Mr. Lee declared on Wednesday. **********Mr. Kim is hoping that the public will be so disgusted by the Government's mishandling of the crisis that it will punish Mr. Lee and the governing party, and he tells voters, ''the country needs a shift of power.'' **********Traditionally, South Korea has been fiercely divided by regional rivalries that go back many centuries but have been exacerbated in recent decades. Mr. Kim is the hero of the Cholla provinces in the southwest, and he normally gets almost all of the votes there but few in the rest of the country, particularly the southeast. **********Those rivalries are still evident in this election, but they may have subsided a bit. There is no candidate from the southeast this time, for Mr. Lee was born in what is now North Korea. **********In addition, Mr. Lee made a campaign swing to Kwangju, in the heart of Cholla, as a show of broad-mindedness. During his two-hour visit, he was heavily protected by riot-equipped policemen and by guards sent by Mr. Kim's supporters, who feared that any clashes could be used against their candidate. In the end, the visit went smoothly. **********''A national leader should not neglect any city or province,'' Mr. Lee thundered in his speech in Kwangju, which chafes at the neglect it has suffered from the Government for several decades. **********The campaign has also been remarkable for its historical ironies. In a tribute to pragmatism or opportunism, depending on one's analysis, Mr. Kim has allied himself with an erstwhile rival who symbolizes the military dictatorship that tried to kill Mr. Kim in the 1970's. **********He has struck a deal with Kim Jong Pil, who has strong support in the southeast but was the founder of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency and was a top adviser to President Park Chung Hee in the 1960's and 1970's. **********President Park's Government tried to murder Kim Dae Jung several times, and the K.C.I.A. once kidnapped him while he was visiting Tokyo, apparently with the idea of drowning him in the ocean.

Hot lines and reciprocal summitry, however useful, inevitably evoke memories of the cold war and United States-Soviet relations, which were anything but normal. **********But managing United States relations with China -- arguably the most important relationship of the post-cold-war world -- will require a more subtle, less Manichean cast of mind than the cold war did. Then, most elements of American society were on the same page. Now they are not, with business pushing for freer trade, trade unionists complaining about unfair competition from cheap goods, and members of Congress and churchmen stressing human rights. **********And all the while, more Americans, perhaps needing one, are coming to regard China as an adversary, if not in political at least in economic terms. In a new Gallup poll taken for CNN and USA Today, 36 percent said they regarded China as unfriendly or an outright enemy. In 1983, before Tiananmen Square, the figure was 21 percent. **********In a news conference with President Jiang Zemin of China this afternoon, an event that lasted more than an hour, President Clinton never once described anything that had happened during the Chinese leader's visit to the United States this week as ''historic.'' **********For the usually ebullient Mr. Clinton, who often points with pride to landmarks and milestones and political breakthroughs, it was a telling omission that epitomized the difficulty of relations between Beijing and Washington. If he seemed muted, an American official said, it was because the negotiations before and during this summit conference, the first of its type in a decade, have been marked by ''ask-no-quarter, give-no-quarter bargaining.'' **********The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that ''after days and days and days, we have found it difficult to have even the most basic kinds of discussions with China,'' except for an important agreement on the first export to China of advanced American nuclear technology. **********On the crucial question of human rights, the two leaders might as well have been on different planets. Top American negotiators had tried to convince Mr. Jiang at least to express remorse for the deaths of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, even if he was unwilling to say the decision to open fire was wrong. **********When Mr. Jiang did not do so, and instead said at the news conference that the Chinese Government had ''drawn the correct conclusion'' and moved swiftly to insure stability, and when he said blandly that ''it is just natural for our two countries to hold different views on some issues,'' Mr. Clinton had no choice, his aides said, but to respond bluntly. He did so, asserting that the shootings and ''the continuing reluctance to tolerate political dissent'' had kept China from developing a significant level of support in the world. **********It was a stark admission of failure, unusual in summit annals. **********The plain fact is that in Chinese-American relations many of the most important questions are not susceptible of solution by top political leaders, or they are susceptible of solution only by running greater risks than the politicians are willing to accept. Most of the progress that has been made, and it is limited, has been made by businessmen and only ratified later by governments, like the big deal under which Boeing will sell 50 jetliners to China. **********''In many senses,'' Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin told American executives in Beijing last month, ''you have invested in this relationship more fully than we have in Washington.'' And today Mr. Clinton gave a certain primacy to economics when he was asked why the United States did not try to broker an agreement between China and Taiwan, as it had sought to do in Bosnia and the Middle East. **********''Since so much investment and contact has gone on in the last few years between Taiwan and China, I think the Chinese people know how to resolve this when the time is right,'' he said, taking the ball from the hands of the diplomats and putting it squarely in the hands of business. **********Except in Washington, where such events always matter more than they do in the country at large, the spotlight has been stolen from the summit conference by the gyrations of Wall Street, gyrations that had their origin in Southeast Asia and in China's new special administrative zone, Hong Kong. **********Only 15 years ago, Americans and their Government felt powerless to stop the march of the Asian economies, and they feared the loss of jobs and control of American financial markets. Now they feel powerless to halt the rot in the Asian economies, and they still fear the loss of jobs and control of American financial markets. **********When cracks began to appear in the ''tiger economies'' of Southeast Asia some months ago, the Administration decided not to attempt any bailout of the type used successfully during the Mexican crisis of 1994-95.  Mr. Rubin has said repeatedly that the United States must not allow itself to be seen as the world's banker of last resort, ready to step into every financial crisis everywhere.  To do so, he has contended, would spawn more crises. **********Even after Monday's plunge in stock prices on Wall Street, there was more talk than action in Washington. That brought criticism from some experts on the region, including a former ambassador, a Democrat, who described the failure to intervene as ''a craven and ultimately damaging approach.'' **********Ultimately, government has to try in some areas, no matter what the problems, because there are a number of things that business cannot or will not do. Human rights are one subject to which business executives are averse. Nor can they negotiate trade agreements, so the Clinton Administration has put a huge effort into finding some way to to integrate China into the world economy and into making it possible for Beijing to join the World Trade Organization. **********But no headway at all was reported after this summit meeting on that difficult subject, either. **********The best the two leaders and their associates could do was concentrate on process, agreeing to meet regularly and to set up a communications link. Mr. Clinton agreed to visit China next spring. Mr. Rubin and Zhu Rongji, China's economic czar, agreed to talk about instability in financial markets. **********There was also talk of ''a constructive strategic partnership,'' but precious little flesh was put onto those bare rhetorical bones, beyond some generalized talk about dealing with continued instability on the Korean peninsula and some significant progress in coping with the touchy problem of nuclear proliferation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/13/world/hutu-refugees-trapped-in-zaire-between-tutsi-and-the-crocodiles.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1997-03-13", "snippet": "Over 100,000 desperate Hutu refugees have fled to makeshift camp near Ubundu, Zaire, pursued by Tutsi-led rebels; rebels, led by Laurent Kabila, maintain that their goal is to overthrow Zaire's longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko; they also want t...", "word_count": 1053, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hutu Refugees Trapped in Zaire Between Tutsi and the Crocodiles", "print_headline": "Hutu Refugees Trapped in Zaire Between Tutsi and the Crocodiles", "body_text": " **********For worn and famished refugees, the makeshift camp strung out like a splintered cross alongside this town's grassy landing field has the frightening feel of the end of the line. **********After a walk of over 300 miles, pursued by this country's Tutsi-led rebels through some of Africa's thickest jungles, terrorized and uprooted each time they set up camp, more than 100,000 desperate Hutu have come to gather here. **********Ahead lie the crocodile-infested rapids of the Congo, which they have no means to cross. From behind, perhaps as little as 20 miles away, their pursuers are approaching, threatening a vengeful rout. **********From the start of Zaire's civil war, the conflict's goals have been neatly twinned. All along, the rebels, led by Laurent Kabila, have maintained that their goal is to overthrow Zaire's longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. **********But throughout, their campaign has just as surely revealed another consistent priority: breaking up the huge concentrations of Hutu who have sought refuge in Zaire since Rwanda's own civil war in 1994 and hunting down all those hiding among them who may have taken part in the massacres committed against the Tutsi. Many among the fleeing Hutu have been armed by Zaire's Government as counterinsurgents. **********Never have the rebellion's two goals been closer to realization. Mr. Kabila's fighters are already believed to be surrounding the regional capital, Kisangani. And a successful rebel push through this area would decimate the haggard Hutu population -- the largest remaining Hutu refugee group in Zaire -- just as surely as the capture of Kisangani would deliver a crippling blow to Mr. Mobutu's Government. **********''We are hungry and we are sick, but above all we have lost all morale,'' said Imaculee Mukarugwiza, a widowed Hutu schoolteacher huddled here with her own two children and five orphans she has taken in since Zaire's rebellion set off the long westward march of refugees in October. ''After what we have been through, it is hard for many of us to recognize each other. Our elders are shriveled and dying and our children already look old.'' **********Questions of strategy debated on both sides of this country's war are mere abstractions for the refugees gathered in the open fields here. Their worst nightmare is a repetition of the routs they have suffered every step of the way, from the rebel bombardment of the huge Goma camp at the war's start to the overrunning of their last settlement at Tingi Tingi. **********''Are all of us guilty of genocide, even these little children?'' asked Mrs. Mukarugwiza. ''We have been chased through the bush like animals. And in three days, Kabila's men will be upon us again, leaving 100,000 of us a choice of death under their bombs or in the jaws of crocodiles.'' **********As she spoke, a sea of people in tattered clothing, many of them visibly weakened by their trek, gathered around one of the first foreigners they have laid eyes on since fleeing Tingi Tingi 11 days ago under a hail of bullets. **********Far from a scene of mass confusion, one quickly makes out the steely young men who, with a whisper and hand sign, or a few words in Kinyarwanda, seem to easily command obedience and keep order. **********Though most of the Hutu refugees in Zaire played little or no role in the 1994 massacres, international relief officials say that many of these authoritative young men are veterans of Rwanda's former Hutu-dominated army or members of Interahamwe, the militia that carried out a campaign of killing against Rwanda's Tutsi minority. **********The campaign against the Hutu refugees has been especially unforgiving, foreign diplomats and Zairian human rights experts say, because many of Mr. Kabila's fighters pushing westward toward Kisangani are Tutsi volunteers from Rwanda bent on avenging the death of relatives at the hands of Hutu. **********For weeks before Mr. Kabila's men made their push on Tingi Tingi, then home to more than 150,000 Hutu, Zaire's constantly retreating army plied the refugee camp with weapons, hoping that properly armed, the former Hutu soldiers would blunt the rebellion's advance. Under international pressure for a cease-fire, Mr. Kabila pledged he would not attack the Tingi Tingi camp, only to have his men overrun it a few days later. **********Refugees here who traveled for more than a week through dense forest tell of being chased for days with the sound of gunfire and mortars seemingly never more that a bend in the footpath away. **********''We walked all day and all night because there was no way to rest,'' said Dr. Camille Kabakira, who has still not seen several of his family members since the attack. ''So many people got lost and left behind in the terror. There was a panic and people scattered as best they could.'' **********In this respect, Zaire's civil war has meant the pursuit of Rwanda's ethnic conflict clear across a neighboring country. Since there appears to be no end to the blood animosity between Hutu and Tutsi, the only answer many Hutu here see for themselves is to beg for international protection or keep pushing westward. **********The refugees' current position makes that second option extremely perilous. The Zaire Government has forbidden the use of a ferry to carry the Hutu across the Congo River. And even if it were to approve, officials of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimated that it would take 100 days to get all of the people across. **********''Let's say they got across the river,'' said Corrine Perthuis, a commission official. ''It wouldn't change anything. We must find a way to provide security for these people from attack.'' **********There has been much talk in recent weeks as well of a ''humanitarian corridor'' that would allow the able-bodied to walk or return in trucks to Rwanda. Despite what they have experienced in their flight across Zaire, however, only a minority of the refugees seemed eager to return home. **********Asked who among them would board a plane for Kigali, the Rwandan capital, if one were to arrive, a handful of men in a thick crowd began to raise their hands before a debate rose up and they were intimidated into changing their answers. **********''If we go to Kigali, it is just making their job of getting rid of us easier,'' said Christophe Sibomana, an angry, rail-thin 30-year-old, referring to Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated Army. ''We would prefer dying right here and leaving the burden on the conscience of the world.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/04/world/in-a-bahrain-port-no-more-sailors-on-the-town.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Jehl", "pub_date": "1997-05-04", "snippet": "US orders sailors on its vessels docking in Manama, Bahrain, to be denied liberty after US Embassy receives information that terrorist attack might be planned against US forces in Bahrain; map (M)", "word_count": 1297, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In a Bahrain Port, No More Sailors on the Town", "print_headline": "In a Bahrain Port, No More Sailors on the Town", "body_text": " **********As a liberty port, Manama cannot compete with the raunchiness of Manila or Bangkok, but the men and women of the United States Navy still regard it as an oasis in the heart of the Persian Gulf. **********Filipino barmaids, to the blare of heavy-metal music, serve up Coors in cans -- nectar in a sheikdom sandwiched by Saudi Arabia and Iran. **********''It would take a brave man to open a girlie bar,'' as one foreigner hastened to point out, but Bahrain has managed to carve out a spirit so cosmopolitan that a framed commendation in one nightspot begins ''Thanks for the nights we can't remember.'' **********So some dismay and apprehension have settled in here in the weeks since the United States abruptly ordered sailors on its vessels docking here to be denied the liberty that had become a custom. At the same time, a 7 P.M. curfew was imposed for all of the 1,000 land-based Navy personnel at the headquarters here of its Fifth Fleet, and the United States Embassy has recommended that even American civilians steer clear of bars and restaurants, saying it has received information that a terrorist attack might be planned against American forces in Bahrain. **********Now the bar stools and dance floors that offered an antidote for thousands of sailors every month are almost empty. Bahrain, a safe and welcoming harbor to the Navy for nearly 50 years, is no longer seen as immune from the kind of anti-American militancy that has preoccupied United States military planners since it exploded back onto the scene in the Persian Gulf region with a bomb attack on an American target in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, some 18 months ago. That attack was followed by another last June that killed 19 Americans. **********The latest warning issued by the embassy here, dated April 23, reported that the embassy ''continues to receive information about possible terrorist threats to the U.S. military in the region, including Bahrain.'' It urged all Americans to ''exercise the strongest possible caution.'' **********Other foreigners, including more than 5,000 Britons, have shrugged off the expressions of alarm, and many American civilians say they have seen little reason to be concerned. The island also remains a haven for Saudis, Kuwaitis and others who are by far the largest share of tourists, flocking here in droves every weekend to seek out the turquoise waters and relaxed atmosphere that makes Bahrain something akin to a Virginia Beach, even if the standard dress is white robes and black chadors. **********Led by the Emir, Sheik Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, who has been in power for 38 years, the ruling family of Bahrain has made little secret of its displeasure at the American action. After sparring for more than two years against a campaign of scattered arson and small-scale bombings that has been waged by members of the Shiite Muslim majority, the Emir and his family, who like most prominent landowners and businessmen here are Sunni, worry that a further sullying of Bahrain's image could complicate their efforts to attract tourism and foreign businesses as substitutes for a small and declining oil sector. **********Bahrain is is the smallest oil producer in the Middle East, with production of about 40,000 barrels a day -- less than 1 percent of what is produced by Saudi Arabia. But for now, it remains dependent on the petroleum industry, earning additional revenue from an offshore oilfield shared with Saudi Arabia and by refining Saudi oil, arrangements that bring total oil and gas earnings to about $2.5 billion a year, about half the Government's total revenue. **********Until the beginning of April, as many as three Navy ships tied up in Manama every week, and there were few restrictions on where sailors could head in their off hours. **********But since it made the warning public on April 7, the Navy has diverted vessels in need of liberty to the United Arab Emirates, where there are American worries stemming from a fatal accident in which a United States sailor was found at fault. For the last 18 months, liberty beyond the Jebel Ali port there has consisted of organized outings in large escorted groups. In the meantime, those aboard the handful of ships already at anchor in Bahrain or those that have visited the port since have mostly had to gaze from the bridge or the deck at Manama, where the raucousness of bars like the Hunter's Lodge and Tabasco Charlie's had become the stuff of Navy lore. **********''The intent is to avoid large gatherings of Americans that would create an inviting target, given the current environment,'' a United States official here said. **********American vessels have been based in Bahrain since 1948, and its designation in 1995 as the permanent headquarters of a re-created Fifth Fleet has added to its uniqueness in the Persian Gulf, where conservative sensibilities mean that other countries in which large numbers of American military personnel are stationed, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, prefer to describe the arrangements as temporary. **********Some 19 United States vessels are now in the narrow, shallow waters of the Persian Gulf, carrying about 12,000 sailors and airmen. That is  slightly lower than the recent average but still reflects the substantial buildup of American forces in the region that has been under way since the Persian Gulf war in 1991. **********While some reports published after the warning was issued drew a link between the United States concerns and the domestic unrest here, American officials have gone out of their way to suggest that the assumption was wrong. **********Since it began in December 1994, the campaign of violence has claimed nearly 30 lives in the name of an effort to persuade the Emir to restore an elected Parliament, which was disbanded in 1975. Hundreds of people remain in jail, including Shiite clerics who have become heroes to their followers, and the crackdown by the authorities drew criticism in the most recent State Department human rights report. **********But despite the high visibility of Americans here, none of the attacks have been aimed at American or even clearly Western targets, and neither the graffiti emblazoned in Shiite villages nor the statements issued by leaders of the movement have even hinted at anti-American sentiment. **********Among those who have been convicted of plotting against the Government, one group of Shiites was accused of taking part in a campaign orchestrated by Iran, and American officials have said they are convinced that those accusations are true. They say that at least some among the group, more than a dozen of whom were sentenced to jail terms after a secret trial last month, were provided with military training by Iran at camps outside Teheran and in the Bekaa region of Lebanon. **********Bahraini and American officials now describe the group as a Bahraini Hezbollah, with ties to its Iran-backed Lebanese namesake, which has a long record of attacks against American targets. But Western diplomats here emphasized that there was no clear evidence of a link between the Bahraini Shiites and the Saudi Shiite who is now being held in a Canadian court in connection with the June bombing of the American barracks in Saudi Arabia. **********The American Ambassador, David Ransom, was said by people who attended a meeting on April 6 at the American Embassy to have called the audience's attention to newspaper reports describing threats against United States forces in the Persian Gulf region made by Osama bin Laden, the multimillionaire Saudi dissident whom the State Department has labeled ''one of the most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremist activities in the world today.'' **********Mr. bin Laden, who was stripped of his Saudi citizenship in 1994 and has now taken refuge in Afghanistan, has in several interviews over the last six months threatened to declare a holy war against the United States and its allies if Washington does not remove its forces from the region."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/03/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-ad-group-chooses-6-for-1997-honors.html": {"writer_name": "Glenn Collins", "pub_date": "1997-10-03", "snippet": "American Advertising Federation inducts six executives into Advertising Hall of Achievement (S)", "word_count": 206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ad Group Chooses 6 For 1997 Honors", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Ad Group Chooses 6 For 1997 Honors", "body_text": " **********The American Advertising Federation in Washington has selected six executives 40 and younger to be inducted into the Advertising Hall of Achievement for 1997.

Mr. Kabila has continued to say that he will accept nothing else, and has warned that the meeting on Wednesday would be Mr. Mobutu's last chance for peaceful surrender. **********Reflecting the quickly shifting reality on the ground, Zairian officials said the United States Ambassador here, Daniel H. Simpson, today urged the Prime Minister, Gen. Likulia Bolongo, to order his remaining troops to allow the rebels to enter Kinshasa peacefully. **********Mr. Kabila claims to have an army of 70,000 soldiers. Western military analysts cannot confirm that number but say he has recruited heavily in recent weeks after the fall of several major cities. Mr. Kabila's army has also been augmented by the arrival of thousands of second-generation Zairian exiles from Angola, who fought on the Government side in Angola's long civil war. **********The rebels' early recruits came from North and South Kivu Provinces and were predominantly Banyamulenge, Zairian ethnic Tutsi. The recruits who were in exile in Angola are Katangese, from southern Zaire. **********As combat has drawn closer to the capital, international mediators and foreign diplomats have grown increasingly concerned about the prospect of fighting in this crowded city of five million, and about a repetition of pillaging by Government soldiers, such as occurred in 1991 and 1993. **********With that danger in mind, Western embassies have stepped up their calls for their citizens to leave Kinshasa immediately. Some 3,500 Western troops, including about 1,200 Americans in Brazzaville, the Congolese capital, were in a state of heightened alert for an evacuation of Kinshasa. **********In Kinshasa, the news of the rebel advance set off a late-afternoon wave of panic. Travel agencies were packed with wealthy Zairians and foreigners who were scrambling to cross the Congo River to Brazzaville, where many of them hoped to find seats on heavily booked flights to Europe and South Africa. **********The air of panic was increased further by an explosion aboard one of the Congo River ferries returning here early this evening from Brazzaville, and wild stories about the opening of hostilities circulated in the city. **********In fact, Zairian and Western military sources said the blast, which killed five people, appeared to be the  accidental explosion of a grenade, possibly after it had been left on the ferry by a deserting Government soldier. **********By late afternoon, even before the curfew announcement, the usually hectic streets of central Kinshasa had nearly emptied, and the money changers who are a fixture on downtown street corners had deserted the area. **********Hoping to speed the Government's fall, opposition parties have called for a three-day strike to paralyze Kinshasa beginning on Wednesday, and many politicians have begun organizing welcoming committees to greet the arriving rebels. **********Reports reaching Kinshasa from the southern rebel-held city of Lubumbashi tonight said that wild celebrations, with troops firing their guns off in the air, had broken out in celebration of the rebels' advance on  the capital. **********Tracts supposedly printed by the rebels have turned up all over Kinshasa urging Government soldiers to lay down their arms and raise white flags in a sign of peace. **********Given Mr. Mobutu's deep unpopularity, the strike on Wednesday is seen as virtually guaranteed to succeed, and almost no one here expects the Government's call to arms to be heard. **********In nearly 32 years of rule, Mr. Mobutu became one of the world's richest leaders, while driving his country, perhaps Africa's most richly endowed, into deep poverty. Mr. Kabila, who has waged unsuccessful revolts against Mr. Mobutu for three decades, launched his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo with heavy backing from Rwanda and Uganda last October and has marched from victory to victory in a seven-month war. **********Even as the fall of Kinshasa appeared increasingly imminent, however, members of Mr. Mobutu's entourage said the 66-year-old leader remained convinced that his forces had begun to rally after seven months of uninterrupted losses, and were about to turn the war around. **********In the last two days, close associates of Mr. Mobutu say, the President has insisted to his family and advisers that the Government had recaptured the city of Kikwit, which is deep behind rebel lines and securely held by Mr. Kabila's forces. **********''They are all dreaming up there,''  a presidential aide said of Mr. Mobutu's immediate entourage, which is cloistered in a hillside military camp at the city's edge. **********''They pick up the telephone and shout orders, promising this and that, saying that fresh funds are on their way, but there is nothing they can do,'' the aide said. ''No one can live this out the way they are living it, but I feel sorry for them now. They still believe they can hang on.'' **********Told of Mr. Mobutu's optimism, a Western diplomat said, ''It is depressing, but I guess we have finally reached the bunker.'' **********If Mr. Mobutu is forced to flee, Zairians and diplomats say, his escape would most likely be by helicopter. Members of his entourage say he has moved his personal effects from his palace in his northern hometown, Gbadolite, to Morocco, and it is assumed that if he goes into exile it would be to that country or to his home in southern France. **********Mr. Mobutu, who is believed to be in the terminal phase of prostate cancer, has been under heavy medication for weeks, and in recent public appearances has shown signs that he is growing steadily weaker. **********And, as the political and military situations have grown increasingly desperate, Mr. Mobutu has shut himself off from meaningful contact with all but an inner circle composed of his immediate family and a handful of close associates, most of whom are drawn from his own northern ethnic group, the Ngbandi. **********Associates of the President said that a meeting of his inner circle turned into a disaster last week, when family members urged that he abandon power and fly to France for urgently needed treatment.

Negotiations continued deep into the night. **********The latest crisis broke at 9:55 A.M., when a soldier identified as Pvt. Noam Friedman, 22, walked out in the main square of the ancient center of Hebron and opened fire  with an M-16 assault rifle on a crowded Palestinian vegetable market. **********Witnesses said he fired one burst, sat down and fired another. Within  seconds, Israeli soldiers pounced on  him and disarmed him as he yelled, ''Don't shoot me!'' **********Chaos ensued, with most Palestinians trying to escape and others trying to charge at the gunman. Several more Palestinians were injured in the panic. Order was soon restored, and Israeli medics rushed to administer first aid to the wounded until ambulances arrived. A brief riot broke out outside the hospital where the wounded were taken. **********Israeli authorities ordered all Palestinians in Hebron to stay indoors, the entrance to the city was closed, and senior officials including Mr. Mordechai and the Army chief of staff, Lieut. Gen. Amnon Shahak, arrived to calm soldiers, settlers and Palestinians. The head of the Israeli security service, Ami Ayalon, met publicly in the main square with the Palestinian chief for the West Bank, Jibril Rajoub. **********As information began to accumulate about Private Friedman, it became increasingly evident that he was not an active religious nationalist extremist in the mold of Yigal Amir, the assassin of the former Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin. Instead, the soldier was characterized as a lonely and troubled person who was expelled from a religious institute because of psychiatric problems  and whose Army enlistment was postponed because of them. All indications were that he had acted alone. **********Private Friedman, a bespectacled  man with a scraggly red beard and the fringe of a tzitzit, the undershirt  of an Orthodox Jew, exposed beneath his fatigues, was performing his mandatory military service. He was assigned to an administrative unit nowhere near here when he decided to create an incident to block the agreement on Hebron, he told investigators. **********On being led to the police van for transfer to Jerusalem, reporters shouted questions to him. ''Are you a normal person?'' a reporter called out. **********''Completely normal,'' he replied. **********''One who kills innocent people is normal?'' **********''They aren't innocents,'' he said. ''They are haters of Israel.'' **********It was not immediately clear how many shots Mr. Friedman managed to squeeze off at close range in the  dense crowd in the market. **********In February 1994 another Jewish settler, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, walked into the tomb of the biblical patriarch Abraham, which is sacred to both Muslims and Jews, and opened fire on praying Palestinians, killing 29 before his rifle jammed and he was overwhelmed and killed by survivors. **********That massacre hangs heavy over all the deliberations about Hebron, and undoubtedly was one reason for the alacrity with which leaders  leaped to head off a confrontation. **********The question certain to be studied in coming days was how a man with Private Friedman's history, which was said to include a recommendation from a psychiatrist that he not be inducted into the army, could have been drafted and issued a weapon. **********In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Israeli politicians and settlers from across the political spectrum denounced the shooting, while Palestinian officials pointed to it as evidence that the problem in Hebron was not the risk of Palestinian terrorism, but terrorism by Jewish zealots. **********Mr. Netanyahu, who had spent the entire night before successfully ushering a lean 1997 budget through the Parliament -- it passed shortly before 6 A.M. today by a vote of 60 to 42 -- issued prompt statements denouncing the shooting. **********''I want to make unequivocally clear: the agreement that we have spoken about in recent months is an essential need in order to prevent violent acts from both sides of the sort we saw today,'' he said. ''And I want to say again in a sharp way that no crime and no violent act will stand in the way of our completing the work.'' **********Mr. Ross, who has been instrumental in bringing the agreement close to conclusion in the last two weeks, issued a statement on behalf of President Clinton expressing ''horror and outrage'' at the shooting. **********Mr. Ross added, ''Those who use violence cannot be permitted to be the arbiters of the future.'' **********Mr. Clinton, on vacation in the Virgin Islands, took time out to call Mr. Arafat for about five minutes to express his sympathy, according to the Reuters news agency. **********Asked why he did not telephone Mr. Netanyahu, the President replied: ''Because he didn't lose the people. I called Mr. Arafat because I had to call, because they were Palestinians that were shot. If it had been Israelis that had been shot I would have called Mr. Netanyahu.'' **********Mr. Arafat said the incident was a ''regrettable act.'' His lieutenants, however, were more explicit in using the incident to hammer away at the constant Israeli emphasis on safeguarding the 450 settlers living in the heart of Hebron. **********''There is no peace with settlers living amidst Palestinians,'' said Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator. ''Palestinians demand protection for the Palestinian people in Hebron, instead of having Israel demand more security for killers in Hebron.'' **********While Private Friedman may have believed he was acting in support of the Hebron settlers, their reaction was to denounce him, in part because they seemed to believe that the shooting would strengthen the Palestinian cause and so undermine whatever hope they still had of successfully influencing a Cabinet vote on the pullout from Hebron. **********Seven of Mr. Netanyahu's 18 ministers have already declared themselves against the agreement, and if two more join them -- a distinct possibility -- the withdrawal could be in new trouble. **********At the same time, spokesmen for Israeli settlers said the shooting was an argument against an Israeli withdrawal because Israel's presence allowed it to put Hebron under curfew today, presumably preventing any Palestinian attacks on Israeli enclaves. **********''We reject any act of bloodshed such as this,'' said David Wilder, one of the spokesmen for the Hebron settlers. ''I can't believe that a person would come down and start shooting and think he's doing us a favor. However, we feel that a situation like this proves the instability of the situation which would arise should the Israeli Army withdraw. What happens after the Arabs are armed? What happens then?'' **********In fact, the redeployment plan would leave a strong Israeli force in place around the enclaves, just as there was today, and by all accounts it was Palestinian officials, not Israeli troops, who kept the Palestinian neighborhoods calm today. **********Simmering tensions between the settlers and the Army surfaced when General Shahak, the Army Chief of Staff, stalked out of a meeting with settler leaders after Rabbi Moshe Levinger, one of the original Hebron settlers, refused to shake his hand and said: ''I'm revolted by the Army. I can't even look at you.'' **********Under the 1995 Israeli-Palestinian agreements, Hebron was to be the seventh West Bank city to come under Palestinian control. But the transfer has been complicated and repeatedly delayed by Israeli fears for the security of the Jewish militants, who live in the center of Hebron to maintain their claim that the city is a biblical birthright of the Jews. **********When Mr. Netanyahu took office in June, he declared that he would toughen the security provisions that had been negotiated by the previous Government. But after seven months of crises, recriminations and talks, Mr. Netanyahu succeeded in wresting only minor changes from the Palestinians. **********It is this fact that has led seven of Mr. Netanyahu's Cabinet members to declare their opposition to the agreement. **********The other cause for the protracted delay was Mr. Arafat's distrust of Mr. Netanyahu's long-term intentions. The Palestinian leader insisted that any deal on Hebron be accompanied by guarantees that Israel would stick to other commitments, including further withdrawals, the release of prisoners and a road connecting the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. **********Most of those demands are expected to be resolved through an American-brokered document appended to the agreement. But among the last details that Mr. Arafat and Mr. Netanyahu must nail down is setting a deadline for the next Israeli withdrawal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/09/business/investing-it-globally-trailblazers-a-fund-for-you.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1997-11-09", "snippet": "State Street Global Advisors introduces fund designed to invest in emerging nations whose economies are not included in any well-known, investible indexes; fund, set up as common trust fund, is not available to individuals (S)", "word_count": 312, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trailblazers, A Fund for You", "print_headline": "INVESTING IT GLOBALLY; Trailblazers, A Fund for You", "body_text": " **********AS if emerging markets did not prove exciting enough for investors recently, now comes an even more speculative alternative: The Pre-Emerging Markets fund, introduced last week by State Street Global Advisors, the money management arm of the State Street Corporation in Boston. **********The Pre-Emerging Markets fund is not, as its name implies, designed to invest in parts of the world where the economies have yet to grow.

Mali's success or failure will quickly be used in the debate about whether the world's least-developed continent is socially or economically ready for Western-style democracy. **********Mali's current political crisis, like those of many of its neighbors, began with deeply flawed elections -- for a new National Assembly last April. **********Diplomats, international observers and senior Malian officials say the vote was poorly organized. As a result, on the day of the election there was widespread confusion at polling places about who was eligible to vote and many of the polls opened late in the day or never received all of their voting materials. **********With returns showing a near landslide for the governing party, Mali's opposition cried foul, accusing supporters of President Alpha Oumar Konare of trying to rig the vote. **********Anxious not to lose the credibility that has made his country a favorite of international donors, Mr. Konare quickly agreed to cancel the results and to organize a second election. But on the eve of that vote, the opposition called for a boycott and began waging a campaign of protests and attacks on offices of the governing party that led to at least one death. **********The re-run of the election was eventually held in July, with a second round in August. Before that, in May,  Mr. Konare, an archeologist by training who insists that this is his last term in office, won re-election virtually unopposed. **********Today, the President governs with a National Assembly composed almost solely of members of his own party, the Alliance for Democracy in Mali. Meanwhile 10 opposition leaders remain in jail over the death of a police officer who was lynched at an opposition meeting last month. **********For members of Mali's so-called radical opposition -- those who boycotted the elections -- the current situation reflects their expectations for a regime that they contend has, all along, only played at democracy for external consumption. Like governments in many of this country's undemocratic neighbors, the opposition contends, the Government has angled for near-absolute power at home. **********''The President can give all of the beautiful speeches he wants to about democracy, along with the elaborate justifications of his policies,'' said Mohamedoun Dicko, secretary general of the Miria party, an opposition group that supported the electoral boycott. ''The fact remains that his party wants to restore one-party rule, and that the National Assembly has again become monochromatic because of this Government's actions.'' **********Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita has dismissed the opposition's charges and called those who boycotted the elections ''simply political hooligans.'' **********In fact, many Malians, as well as many foreigners, say that for all the surface similarity to crises elsewhere, several political features set Mali apart from its neighbors, and it is these features that they say, in the end, may save its democracy. **********For all of the signs of a political machine that critics say is growing up around Mr. Konare's presidency, there is no evidence, foreign diplomats say, of any major Government-organized attempt at fraud in any of the country's recent elections. **********Since the vote, Mr. Konare has promised broad electoral reforms that include campaign funding and spending limits for all parties. **********The Malian media have a remarkable degree of liberty to criticize the Government or to support opposition positions. Significantly, in a country where illiteracy remains high, this freedom extends to private radio stations as well as newspapers. **********Mr. Konare, who is 51, has repeatedly gone out of his way to state his intention to retire from politics at the end of his second term, refusing the urgings of some of those around him that he change Mali's Constitution to permit a third term. **********But if facts like these set Mali apart, it is equally true that many of its difficulties stem from realities that have stymied new democracies elsewhere in Africa -- from Sierra Leone and Niger, where soldiers have seized power, to Zambia and Chad, where incumbents have rigged elections to insure comfortable victories. **********During four decades of independence from colonial rule, many Africans say, one-party rule bred a culture of intolerance and left political skills of coalition-building, negotiation and compromise atrophied. **********These traits can be seen as readily among those in opposition as in hard-liners in the governing party here. **********Moreover, in many of Africa's extremely poor countries, like this one, the state and its resources are the only economic game in town and politics in the recent democratic era has often quickly devolved into a deadly winner-take-all struggle for the spoils. **********''In your country, you have Democrats and Republicans, and when one side loses, they pack their bags and go home, making a living at law or medicine or whatever, while they bide their time for the next election,'' said Gen. Amadou Toumani Toure, who remains a national hero here for taking power briefly in 1991 at the end of the dictatorship and organizing the country's first democratic elections, in which he was not a candidate. **********''In a country as poor as Mali, that kind of thing goes over very badly,'' General Toure said. ''That is why I think we must find a more consensual way of governing democratically.'' **********For others, the most serious liability of this new struggle over access to the resources of the state is the fact that in countries whose development needs remain staggering, political debate is almost always about power and rarely about policy. **********''Elections and alternance are obviously important,'' said Aminata Traore, a sociologist who has sought to mediate in the crisis between the Government and opposition here. ''But we have spent five years without asking essential questions about our development. Elections are being reduced to a fratricidal struggle between self-interested politicians.'' **********Some African leaders have said that the continent is simply not yet ready for Western-style electoral systems. **********Uganda's President, Yoweri K. Museveni, has instituted a ''no-party'' voting system in his country, which he rules with a strong authoritarian hand. **********In recent years, Mr. Museveni's Uganda -- which has enjoyed relative stability and fast economic growth and has received the strong backing of Washington and international financial institutions -- has emerged as something of a model for many of its neighbors. **********For his part, Mr. Konare, whose country is surrounded by outright authoritarians and far less democratic states, rejects the no-party model and remains confident in Mali's democratic experiment. **********''I do not underestimate the difficulties, but I do not accept excuses that say Africa should not make an effort to be pluralist,'' Mr. Konare said. ''I have a lot of respect for the President of Uganda, but I don't know how much of the Museveni experiment will survive Museveni. Here, I am certain that pluralism will survive Konare.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/22/world/russians-are-said-to-block-plans-for-bosnian-serb-elections.html": {"writer_name": "Raymond Bonner", "pub_date": "1997-08-22", "snippet": "Russia thwarts proposal to have international organization supervise elections that Bosnia Serb Pres Biljana Plavsic has called in her power struggle with her predecessor, Radovan Karadzic; this is setback for Clinton Administration and major Euro...", "word_count": 522, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russians Are Said to Block Plans for Bosnian Serb Elections", "print_headline": "Russians Are Said to Block Plans for Bosnian Serb Elections", "body_text": " **********In a closed-door meeting here today, Russia put the brakes on a proposal to have an international organization supervise elections that the Bosnia Serb President, Biljana Plavsic, has called in her power struggle with her predecessor, Radovan Karadzic. **********The Russian action is a setback for the Clinton Administration and major European Governments, which have openly sided with Ms. Plavsic in her political war, including her call for elections in the Serbian-controlled territory of Bosnia.

And some health care experts project 5 to 10 percent growth in medical costs in 1998. **********Prices are under growing pressure as managed care companies strive to make up for the thin profits they tolerated while holding down prices and pushing for new members. **********And the underlying forces that drove up health care costs in the 1980's are still powerful: the aging population, compounded now by middle-aged baby boomers who require more medical services; more expensive medical technology like bone marrow transplants to help cancer patients, and new drug combinations, like those for AIDS that can cost $12,000 a year. **********Costs might also rise fractionally from new Federal and state laws that prohibit some cost-cutting efforts, such as insurers' limiting of hospital stays after childbirth. **********Hospitals and doctors in some cities, meanwhile, have increased their ability to demand higher fees by forming alliances and merging into bigger entities. **********Higher prices are expected to fall especially heavily on private employers as the Government squeezes Medicare payments to hospitals, doctors and health maintenance organizations. Many H.M.O.'s have been getting relatively generous Medicare fees, which make it easier to offer low prices to employers and workers in the private sector. **********Employers predicted that their medical costs would grow by 4 percent in 1997, a jump from the 2.5 percent average rise last year, according to a survey of 3,200 employers with 10 or more workers published yesterday by the Foster Higgins benefits consulting firm. **********The combined annual premiums paid by employers and employees averaged $3,915 an employee in 1996, compared with $3,821 in 1995 and $3,741 in 1994, which was the only recent year when premiums fell (by 1.1 percent), the Higgins survey said. **********The Labor Department said consumers' medical costs rose 3 percent last year while the overall Consumer Price Index was up 3.3 percent. **********Aetna Inc., for example, one of the biggest health insurance companies, said its premiums were 3 percent to 6 percent higher than last year in managed care plans and up to 10 percent higher for traditional fee-for-service insurance. Premiums had been flat during 1996 at both Aetna and its U.S. Healthcare unit. **********Some who track medical costs say the increases, which are already reflected in managed care premiums in some regions, may surge in 1998 as a number of inflationary trends come together. ''With the changes in Medicare, we might see a return to double-digit health care inflation in 1998,'' said John Erb, a principal at Foster Higgins and the chief analyst for the survey. **********Peter Reilly, an actuary with Milliman & Robertson, another benefits consulting firm, said his calculations  projected increases of 3 to 5 percent this year and 5 to 8 percent in 1998. **********''Everything we hear is that prices are beginning to tick up again to high single digits and even double digits,'' said Rob Fowler, executive director of the Council of Smaller Enterprises, a coalition of 12,500 employers in northeastern Ohio. **********Beverly Sloan, executive director of health benefits at U S West, the Denver-based telecommunications company, said the company's health costs rose 5 percent in 1996, after three years of increases of 2 percent or less. **********''Medicare is the 800-pound gorilla,'' she said. If the Government clamps down on Medicare to reduce Federal spending, that will increase the pressure on insurers and health care providers to raise charges to private employers, she said. **********Trying to fend off that possibility, U S West, like many big companies, is requiring its health plans to offer three-year contracts. **********Bob Dankmyer, a vice president of Marriott International, said his company was demanding ''multiyear rate guarantees'' that would limit increases to the growth in the Consumer Price Index. **********''If you are big and strong and a good negotiator, you pay less,'' said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst at the Sanford C. Bernstein & Company securities firm. **********But small employers may not be able to stop the H.M.O.'s and providers of health care from ''slam-dunking the private sector,'' as Ms. Sloan put it. BB Graphics, a printing company with seven employees in Merrillville, Ind., had a 25 percent rise in its costs last year and expects a further 7 percent increase in May, said William Stack, the owner. **********Stuart Altman, a health policy professor at Brandeis University, said, ''We haven't broken the cycle of people wanting more health care.'' As evidence, he pointed to the popularity of health plans that still allow members to select physicians and influence their own care. **********''Most managed care companies have done a decent job of getting discounts from providers,'' he said, ''but they have not fundamentally changed the practice of medicine. With managed care, health care costs are going up more slowly, but they are still going up.'' **********Mr. Fowler of the Ohio coalition said, ''We may have squeezed out all that we can through managed care.'' **********And Mr. Abramowitz said: ''The pendulum is swinging. The news media tell you to consume more health care. You have your rights to the drugs and doctors you need. Drug companies are advertising direct to the consumer and hospitals are marketing themselves.'' All the pressure to consume adds to costs, he said. **********In New York State, higher hospital charges following rate deregulation may add 2 percent to costs in 1997, for a total increase of 6 percent, said David Snow, an executive vice president with Oxford Health Plans. Paul Philpott, a senior vice president of Physicians Health Services, said deregulation might raise premiums beyond 6 percent in New York. **********Professor Altman of Brandeis said the return of medical inflation would reflect ''the old insurance cycle: they overestimate their ability to control costs and lose money for a couple of years, then they make it up by raising their premiums.'' **********Mr. Reilly of Milliman & Robertson said insurance companies and H.M.O.'s ''don't forecast the future growth of costs very well.'' **********''They look at their past experience,'' he said.

Mr. Gramlich, whose appointment to the Federal Reserve Board was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday, was chairman of the Advisory Council on Social Security last year. **********It is bad enough for the Government to tell us half-truths about the tax increase needed to keep the system afloat. But the Government also maintains that the 2.2 percent solution is based on ''intermediate'' assumptions about evolving trends in our population and the economy. Not so. **********Consider the projection for future life spans. According to Samuel Preston, a demographer at the University of Pennsylvania, the life expectancy in Japan was 79.7 years in 1994. But Social Security assumes that America won't catch up to that figure until 2050 -- a lag of 56 years. Many demographers think that is way off. They believe that Americans will live about five years longer than the Government assumes. **********Or, consider Social Security's assumption about the future growth of wages. It calculates this rate at nine-tenths of 1 percent a year, after inflation. That is much higher than the average of six-tenths of 1 percent since 1975. And the difference becomes huge over 75 years. **********Keeping the books this way makes the program look healthier than it is and protects it from short-term change. But it also sets up the system for a huge fall. **********Shripad Tuljapurkar, a forecaster with Mountain View Research in Los Altos, Calif., makes the important point that there would be only a 50-50 chance that the books will balance even if the Government's intermediate assumptions seem about right today. But are 50-50 odds good enough? **********The time has come to face real and growing risks, not just to cut the numbers to suit the current fashion. We live in a world where almost anything can happen. If the country wants to be, say, 95 percent certain that Social Security will be safe for the next 75 years, taxes would need to go up much more than 2.2 percent. **********People therefore need a much better benchmark to tell them how much their  benefits are at risk. Fortunately, that yardstick is available. It is based on standard statistical techniques that forecasters working for private business use routinely. **********REGARDLESS of whether Social Security's horizon should be forever or much shorter than it is today -- or whether its method for assessing risks is outdated -- it is clear that the solution's cost rises each year. But we can't stop thinking about tomorrow just because it isn't pleasant or because we want to protect sacred cows. Social Security is in deep trouble. So far, America has been keeping its head in the sand, tinkering around the edges and condemning us and our children to sky-high payroll taxes in the future. **********Britain and Chile have acted decisively. They have been financing most of their social security systems privately and in advance, either through mandatory individual retirement accounts or company plans -- both of which replace pension payments from the government. More and more countries will be following their examples because they can be the best way to prevent Social Security's black box from turning into an enormous black hole."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/31/business/laura-ashley-stock-drops-after-resignation.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-07-31", "snippet": "Shares of Laura Ashley Holdings PLC drop to 78 cents, lowest level in more than six years, following resignation of design director, Basha Cohen; she is third executive to leave in two months (S)", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Laura Ashley Stock Drops After Resignation", "print_headline": "Laura Ashley Stock Drops After Resignation", "body_text": " **********The shares of Laura Ashley Holdings P.L.C. fell yesterday to their lowest level in more than six years after the company, a clothing retailer, said its design director, Basha Cohen, had resigned.

He added that today's contracts ''show a good relationship has developed in the political sphere between China and France.'' Though Airbus is a consortium of several European companies, Aerospatiale of France owns 38 percent of it. **********In April 1996, a month after jousting with the United States over its relations with Taiwan, China awarded another $1.5 billion order to Airbus when Prime Minister Li Peng visited Paris. **********In April, Beijing was particularly angered by Washington's vote at a United Nations conference in Geneva for a resolution to condemn China's record on human rights. France voted against the resolution. **********Since that day, Boeing executives have predicted gloomily that Airbus would be rewarded when Mr. Chirac came to China. **********Still, Boeing has not been cut out of China's lucrative market. In March, when Vice President Al Gore visited Beijing, an order for five Boeing 777's, worth $1.3 billion, was placed.  Another purchase of Boeing planes could be announced when China's President, Jiang Zemin, visits Washington later this year. And Boeing executives, who uniformly say lost sales are due to politics rather than to quality, did say they expected to sell more planes in China than Airbus this year. **********Aviation executives point out that while China's leaders are experts at timing their commercial decisions for maximum political impact, the real factors behind choosing Airbus or Boeing often remain hidden. While politics matter, so do other concerns, like the needs and desires of China's 22 separate airline companies. **********One important factor in selecting Airbus or Boeing, one aviation executive said, is concern among China's central authorities to balance out the two manufacturers, to avoid becoming too reliant on one supplier. Because China used to split orders three ways, among Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas, the executive said that Boeing's planned acquisition of McDonnell Douglas could mean more orders for Airbus. **********''The trend in the U.S. is toward fleet continuity,'' said the executive, who is familiar with airlines in China. ''For pilots and for maintenance, it's much more efficient for an airline to use the same kind of planes. **********''But in China, they are often choosing sales on other considerations. There are several Chinese carriers who don't want Airbus planes and are getting them anyway.'' **********Roughly 60 percent of the planes in China today are Boeings, compared with around 15 percent for Airbus. The rest are McDonnell Douglas or old Soviet-made models. **********The future stakes are gigantic: China is expected to buy more than 2,000 aircraft -- worth an estimated $140 billion -- over the next 20 years. **********In the tangled trade relationship between China and the United States, characterized by heated disputes over issues like trade imbalances and market access, each side seems to be simultaneously looking for ways to entice and threaten its trading partner. **********China's embrace of Airbus today seemed to be a combination of implied stick and carrot for the United States and for Boeing, the nation's largest exporter. Anger us, the Chinese officials seemed to be saying, and you may see your piece of this lucrative aviation pie diminish. **********Today's order of 30 aircraft includes 10 A320 models and 20 A321's, each of them seating 150 to 200 passengers and able to fly 3,500 miles, meaning they will be used for domestic and regional flights. They are scheduled to be delivered between 1998 and 2000. **********Jean Pierson, Airbus's managing director, said in a statement that his company interpreted the purchase as a new vote of confidence in the A320, whose main competitor is the Boeing 737, the most widely used commercial aircraft in the world. The 777 is a newer wide-body model, which is much larger and more expensive and is used for long flights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/01/world/global-warming-congress-the-kibbitzer-at-the-climate-table-waits-for-its-turn.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Schmitt", "pub_date": "1997-12-01", "snippet": "Skeptical and suspicious Congress will be watching closely as Clinton Administration negotiates international treaty to curb global warming; coping with climate change is shaping up as another thorny intergenerational issue that forces lawmakers t...", "word_count": 957, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Congress, the Kibbitzer at the Climate Table, Waits for Its Turn", "print_headline": "GLOBAL WARMING; Congress, the Kibbitzer at the Climate Table, Waits for Its Turn", "body_text": " **********WHEN President Clinton's negotiators sit down in Japan on Dec. 1 with their international counterparts to hammer out a treaty to fight global warming, a skeptical and suspicious Congress will be watching closely over their shoulders. **********A growing body of scientific evidence supports the idea that emissions of heat-trapping gases are disrupting normal weather patterns. Opinion polls show that the theory is gaining public credibility. **********But Congress is wary. Coping with climate change is shaping up as another thorny intergenerational issue, like overhauling Social Security or Medicare, that forces lawmakers to make painful political choices now that will probably not yield tangible benefits for years or even decades. **********At a spirited hearing earlier this month, House members groped with how to deal with the problem. They bombarded Timothy E. Wirth, an Undersecretary of State who has been the Administration's lead negotiator on global warming, with detailed questions that he could not answer about a treaty's economic consequences. In exasperation, Representative Dan Schaefer, a Colorado Republican who heads the House Commerce energy and power subcommittee, warned Mr. Wirth, ''If you do it dumb, it could cost a lot of money.'' **********The politics of global warming on Capitol Hill is still very much unformed. Only a handful of lawmakers have studied the complicated issue in depth. But that has not stopped many others from staking out positions consistent with those of their traditional allies in labor, business or the environmental movement. **********Even after President Clinton's vow last month that the United States would not sign any climate treaty that hurt the American economy or failed to win commitments from developing nations to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, Congress is still dubious. **********CONGRESS plays a pivotal role in the issue. Any treaty will require approval from two-thirds of the Senate. The House has no formal role in ratifying treaties, but every step needed to carry out an accord, from policy changes to spending on programs, would have to go through that chamber. **********The lawmakers' underlying fear is that the United States will end up shouldering an unfair share of the emissions reductions. That, they say,  would lead to some kind of energy tax to curb consumption, which would chill the economy, which would cost jobs. Legislators also express concern that binding limits on emissions might be deferred for large developing countries like China and Mexico, projected as the fastest-growing polluters of the future. **********Republicans are already promising to make tax cuts a major issue in the 1998 Congressional elections, so they say any accord that even hints at a tax increase will be dead on arrival. **********''Protecting our environment is an honorable goal,'' Representative Bill Paxon, a fast-rising Republican star from New York, said earlier this fall.  ''But we must ask ourselves an equally important question: 'Can we afford to destroy our children's economic future in the process?' '' **********Of course, unyielding opposition to action would be a tricky proposition for even the most free-market Republicans. President Clinton and the Democrats have used environmental issues -- and the perceived disdain Republicans have for them -- as an effective political cudgel in the past two years. But in the current political climate, economic concerns trump most environmental worries. **********The science of global warming is still a contentious issue among lawmakers. A solid core of members of Congress -- most of them Republicans, but some Democrats -- insist that the proposed emissions changes are based on inconclusive evidence. That position is supported by the major foes of a climate treaty: the oil, coal and automobile industries and major electric utilities. **********''The science doesn't fit into neat little boxes,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who is leading a Senate observer group to the final negotiations in Kyoto, Japan. ''Many climatologists will tell you this is nonsense. We just don't know enough about it.'' **********But other lawmakers are leery of the Administration's plan to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2012 even though they agree that there is an impending crisis. Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who is a powerful defender of the nation's coal industry, said, ''The problem is global and can only be solved on a global basis.'' **********Democrats and Republicans are divided within their own ranks. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who staunchly defends Detroit's automobile industry, criticize the Administration for going too far. **********An avid environmentalist, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, says President Clinton must make a stronger case for a global agreement. ''There is no consensus on the Hill, and there won't be until the President explains the issue better to the American people,'' Mr. Waxman said. **********CONGRESS has already influenced the Administration's negotiating position. On a vote of 95 to 0 in July, the Senate passed a resolution urging the Administration not to pursue a treaty unless the agreement requires developing nations to control their emissions. **********This nonbinding resolution forced the Administration to harden its stance toward developing countries.  The measure also urged Mr. Clinton to avoid any treaty that would cause ''serious harm'' to the American economy, a provision that helped move the Administration away from considering direct energy taxes and toward a series of tax credits and research subsidies to encourage energy conservation. **********''Our challenge,'' said Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, ''is to shape an agreement which sets tough, realistic global-emission reduction goals while harnessing market forces to lower costs, foster technological development and insure economic growth.'' **********Treaties are complex documents that, even after they are signed, take years of preparation before they can be ratified. ''Assuming a fully acceptable treaty is reached in Kyoto,'' said Todd Stern, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton on climate change, ''you could be well into 1999 by the time you're talking about ratification.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/04/business/dow-up-232-as-markets-soar-abroad.html": {"writer_name": "Sharon King", "pub_date": "1997-11-04", "snippet": "American stocks rally, fueled by rebound in Asian and European equity markets; Dow Jones industrial average soars 232 points to close at 7,674.39, within 41 points of where it was before it plunged 554.26 points week ago; Standard & Poor's index o...", "word_count": 984, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Up 232 As Markets Soar Abroad", "print_headline": "Dow Up 232 As Markets Soar Abroad", "body_text": " **********A rebound in Asian and European equity markets fueled a rally for American stocks yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average roaring ahead more than 232 points.

Chase Manhattan rose almost 3 percent, after a credit-rating agency said that the creditworthiness of Chase and two other money center banks -- BankAmerica and Citicorp -- would not be hurt by the recent global market turmoil.

But the percentage gain did not come close to ranking among the top 10 in the 101-year history of the average; the 10th-largest percentage increase was a 9.08 percent gain on May 6, 1932. **********The market's other major indexes were up as well, but not as sharply. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 24.37 points, or 2.66 percent, to 938.99, while the Nasdaq index jumped 36.37 points, or 2.28 percent, to 1,629.98. All these indexes are close to regaining all they lost last Monday but are about 5 percent or more below their record highs reached earlier this year. **********The gains in overseas markets did much to improve American investors' confidence, as many seemed to believe that the worries about those markets, especially in Asia, may have been overdone. **********Yesterday, Hong Kong stocks ended up 5.9 percent, after losing more than 4.6 percent in the previous week. In London, the FTSE-100 index rose 1.3 percent and in Germany the DAX index gained 2.5 percent. **********In Tokyo today, the Nikkei index of 225 issues stood at 16,455.04, down 3.90 points, in late-afternoon trading. The market was closed yesterday because of a national holiday. At midday, Hong Kong stocks were down just under 1 percent. **********Many investors, traders and analysts yesterday were relieved that the month of October was past, saying that all of the media coverage about the 10th anniversary of the October 1987 market crash did indeed grate on investors. Despite that, the continued confidence displayed  by individual investors was a big factor in giving stocks a lift yesterday, analysts said. **********In moving higher, the market ignored some economic reports -- like a stronger-than-expected increase in the National Association of Purchasing Management index -- that might have proved negative for stocks because they could raise inflation concerns and push interest rates higher. **********Yesterday's volume of 573.2 million shares was well below the average daily volume last week of 800 million, and not much above this year's average of 520 million shares. **********''It's not exactly confirmation volume for the kind of move that we've seen,'' said Arthur Hogan, a senior trader at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. ''For these kinds of moves, you like to see more robust volume. The same sort of things that took us down before are still out there.'' **********One sign of the sharpness of the rebound was the recovery by the Morgan Stanley multinational index, which includes many corporations with big exposures in Asia, of all it had lost. It rose 2.79 percent, to 512.05, yesterday, leaving it above the 509.03 closing level on Oct. 24. **********An urge to bargain-hunt helped technology stocks yesterday, with Intel, Microsoft, Compaq Computer and Dell Computer among the most actively traded issues. The Morgan Stanley high-technology index, which fell 4.2 percent last week, gained 4.21 percent yesterday, closing at 475.04, less than one point below its level on Oct. 24, the Friday before last Monday's selloff. **********But some analysts warned that the future does not look that much brighter for technology shares than it did before the large declines. **********''I think people were just bottom- fishing,'' said Rob Chaplinsky, a semiconductor analyst at Hambrecht & Quist.

Behind some of these doorways, however, lie the elegant and spacious courtyard dwellings of the families of China's Communist Party leaders, a new kind of Forbidden City. **********In one dirt-and-cobblestone lane, one black limousine after another  came to call this week to see the elderly widow and five middle-aged children of Deng Xiaoping. **********The visitors were classmates and colleagues, relatives and friends, fellow members of a select club: the sons and daughters to China's senior leaders, also known as princelings, or taizi, as they are called in Chinese. **********The five Deng children have enjoyed being at the pinnacle of this club for years, but one question that looms over Beijing since Mr. Deng's death is exactly how it will affect them. **********Mr. Deng's death has not led to any  repudiation of his rule, at least not yet, so there is no sudden movement to purge his relatives. Their wealth, though it causes resentment among more ordinary folk, is partly protected by the deep sense of fraternity  among the politically privileged. **********''None of the Deng children have any money problems, but the problem lies right there,'' said the daughter of a senior official, suggesting that they had taken advantage of their positions to make large sums of money. ''They are all vulnerable, but I don't think anything will happen to them unless they look as if they're getting excessive.'' She spoke on the condition of anonymity. **********Translating superior connections into lucrative business, the class of princelings has profited enormously  from the economic freedom the previous generation introduced. **********The myth of Communist China was that everyone would be equal, if poor; today's version is that a socialist-market economy gives everyone a chance to grow rich. But the rules are stacked, it turns out, in favor of the families of the leaders who make the rules. **********While the Deng family's position at the top of this club has receded slightly with Mr. Deng's health in the last year or two, the brothers and sisters are so entrenched in the network that purging one or more would require serious political effort by Jiang Zemin, China's President. **********Last year he had a chance. The younger of Mr. Deng's sons, Deng Zhifang, was at the top of a state-run  corporation whose leaders were prosecuted for corruption. **********Deng Zhifang returned to China in 1990 after studying physics at the University of Rochester for seven years. A socially awkward man, he was fascinated by the challenge of  adapting computer software to Chinese characters, but, apparently unable to resist the lure, he turned to business. **********He accepted some of the deals offered by the many Hong Kong businessmen looking for ''iron connections'' within China, including a partnership with Li Ka-shing, a billionaire real estate developer. But the young Mr. Deng became most closely allied with Zhou Beifang, who headed the Hong Kong subsidiary of China's leading steel producer, Shougang Corporation, and whose father,  Zhou Guanwu, the head of the corporation, was close to Deng Xiaoping. **********Last November, when the younger Mr. Zhou was sentenced to life in prison for taking bribes of more than  $1 million, it was unclear whether Deng Zhifang would also be investigated, a decision so sensitive that it could be made only with the approval of President Jiang. Since then, Mr. Deng has resigned his position as a managing director at the Hong Kong company, but remains a consultant. **********''Deng Zhifang has probably set it up so he can go overseas if he needs to,'' a member of a prominent political family said. ''It's hard to imagine Jiang Zemin moving against him.'' **********Deng Xiaoping's youngest daughter, Xiao Rong, angered senior leaders when she gave The New York Times an interview in January 1995 without their prior permission, and discussed her father's failing health. **********Deng Pufang, her older brother, made a speech last summer that  ostensibly defended his father's aggressive economic reform policies, but which apparently was interpreted by some senior officials as a defense of the Deng family's influence, and their right to wield it. **********Family members are said to have frequently quarreled with the Communist Party staff over how to care for Mr. Deng as his health deteriorated. These instances may be a normal part of the push-and-pull tension that always exists between a political family and the government with which it is intertwined. **********Yet such clashes often required the intervention of Wang Ruilin, a top aide to Mr. Deng for decades, and head of Mr. Deng's personal office until it was formally disbanded a few months ago. **********''The importance of his role in assisting Jiang Zemin has been in getting the Deng family out of politics,'' said Michael D. Swaine, director of the Center for Asia-Pacific Policy at the Rand Corporation. **********Zhuo Lin, Mr. Deng's wife of 58 years, is 80 and has suffered from a nerve disease that became so painful, acquaintances said, that one day last year she took so many painkillers that she almost died. The panic that ensued among doctors set off a round of rumors that Mr. Deng was close to death, before word gradually spread that it was his wife. **********The leader's widow is said to eschew the kind of ostentatious luxury her children enjoy, keeping with the tradition of the elder generation of China's leaders, who extolled Communism and simple living. **********But the sons and daughters of senior leaders are highly secretive and almost tribal in the way they keep to insulated circles of friends, It is often difficult to uncover even the most basic information about them, including where they work or live or invest their money, except in unusual cases like Deng Zhifang's. **********Yet some information is available: ***********Deng Lin, the eldest daughter, 55, was once a painter of traditional Chinese watercolors who more recently started dabbling in abstract expressionism. Critics have not been as enthusiastic about her work as have Japanese businessmen, particularly ones with operations in China. ***********Deng Pufang, the eldest son, 52, is chairman of China's Federation for the Disabled. He has used a wheelchair since he fell from a fourth-story window after being harassed by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. ***********Deng Nan, a second daughter, 51, is a deputy minister in the State Commission for Science and Technology. ***********Xiao Rong, 46, who for years accompanied her father and yelled in his ear to compensate for his poor hearing, has two positions listed on her business card: deputy chairwoman of the China Association for International Friendly Contact, and deputy to the National People's Congress, the rough equivalent of a Congresswoman. **********Also a consultant to many Hong Kong companies, Xiao Rong has said she still draws a $125-a-month salary from the army, where she once worked full time. **********Her husband, He Ping, is president of the Poly Group, one of China's leading arms sellers. **********Deng Xiaoping had four grandchildren, and at least one is enrolled in a secondary school in the United States. **********Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, when a breakdown in social and political order meant that the families of leaders were divided, persecuted and often sent to internal exile, the system has deemed that  party families maintain discipline; consequently, few are actually prosecuted except in extreme and unusual cases, like Zhou Beifang's. **********Nor do they like to talk to, or at times even be seen by, outsiders. **********This week, a few policemen stood at the entrance to the lane, firmly stopping any outsiders who tried to enter, saying the residential street was ''a restricted military area.''

Corporate revenues rose 129.5 percent, to $14.6 trillion in 1995 from almost $6.4 trillion in 1980, while taxable corporate profits rose 127 percent, to $560.1 billion from $246.6 billion. Corporate income taxes rose 114 percent, to $197 billion from $91.9 billion. **********Executive pay can grow much faster than corporate profits ''only because chief executives are paying themselves,'' said Robert Monks, a principal of Lens Inc., an investment fund. ''They have all this diaphanous language about performance and all these committee reports on how pay was determined, but the simple truth is that executives are setting their own pay.'' **********The tax data actually understate significantly both the actual rise in corporate pay and the higher rate at which it has grown in comparison with corporate revenues, profits and income taxes. This is because over the 15-year period major changes took place in the composition of executive pay packages, effectively delaying corporate income tax deductions for the bulk of executive compensation for periods ranging from a few years to several decades. **********Executives can defer part of their salary or bonus, for example, and delay making tax payments until the deferral ends, usually after retirement. **********The really big deferrals, however, are in stock options. No taxes are due on stock options until they are exercised, which on average is seven years after they are granted, said Graef Crystal, publisher of The Crystal Report, an executive pay newsletter. **********At the 1,000 large and midsized publicly traded companies that he tracks, Mr. Crystal said, the value of options awarded but not yet exercised by the chief executives was $9.9 billion last year, while the executives made $1.2 billion from options they did exercise. **********Even when stock options are exercised the profits may not appear in the I.R.S. statistical tables for years. That is because many companies allow executives to defer their stock option profits until after they retire. **********Neither the I.R.S., the Treasury Department nor the tax-writing committees in Congress collect data on compensation deferred by executives. Executive pay experts say that the total runs into the tens of billions of dollars and perhaps into the hundreds of billions. The chief executive of Coca-Cola, Roberto C. Goizueta, alone has more than $1 billion in his deferral accounts, company filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the last 17 years show. **********The highly publicized compensation packages granted to some executives a few years ago, at a time when pay for ordinary workers was relatively flat, had prompted growing calls for efforts to rein in executive pay. In 1993, Congress passed a law limiting to $1 million the amount of base pay to senior executives that a corporation could deduct on its income tax return. Before 1994, there was no limit on the deductibility of executive pay. **********But the new I.R.S. figures show that not only did the law fail to accomplish its advertised goal, but executive pay actually rose at a 29 percent faster rate in the first year after the law took effect than in the previous 14 years that the service had collected comparable information. **********From 1994, when the law took effect, to 1995 the amount that corporations deducted on their corporate income tax returns for executive pay increased more than 9.1 percent, the I.R.S. figures indicate, compared with an average increase of 7 percent between 1980 and 1994. **********''There was a lot of hoopla about how this law was supposed to cut down executive pay,'' said Michael Graetz, the author of ''The Rise (and Fall?) of the Income Tax'' and a Yale Law School professor, ''but the law was really designed to not have any real effect and this shows that, just as intended, it had no effect.'' **********The $1 million limit on tax deductible base pay can be avoided in several ways. One is to tie pay to any of several measures of performance, like higher sales or profits. Another option is for the executive to defer receipt of base salary amounts above $1 million until after retiring. **********While big pay packages may cost the corporate treasury, they can actually benefit the Government. Professor Graetz noted that most top executives pay Federal income and Medicare taxes at a marginal rate of 41.05 percent, while the corporate income tax rate is 35 percent.

They also announced that they had found two more, who were linked for the first time to another victim of the virus. That posed once again the crucial public health question -- can the flu be spread from human to human just as it seems to have been spread from chickens to humans? **********The health authorities here were careful not to draw quick conclusions. **********''The transmission of the virus both from bird to human and human to human are possible,'' said Dr. Margaret Chan, Hong Kong's director of health. ''We have stressed that given the current evidence, there is stronger evidence to prove avian-to-human transmission, and we have never ruled out human-to-human transmission.'' **********At the same time, Dr. Chan -- as well as other Hong Kong health authorities and Dr. Keiji Fukuda, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta -- emphasized that the virus, called H5N1, that was sweeping through the chicken population had not reached epidemic levels here. **********''I don't think we have an epidemic,'' Dr. Chan said. ''If we had an epidemic, we would have hundreds and thousands of cases.'' **********But, Dr. Fukuda warned, ''Whenever a new virus like this appears and causes a small number of cases like this, it creates tremendous concern among scientists. Influenza viruses are almost unique in their ability to spread rapidly around the world.'' **********There have been three influenza pandemics this century. In 1957, the influenza pandemic killed between 90,000 and 100,000 in the United States alone. **********Although the first death from this new virus occurred in May, when a 3-year-old child succumbed, only today did Hong Kong's health, hospital and agricultural officials meet jointly to devise steps to combat the spread of the disease. **********Dr. Chan said that the committee ordered ''tightened control on the import of chicken, enhanced surveillance in both man and poultry, as well as improvements in environmental hygiene in markets.'' Several wholesale poultry markets have been closed for inspection and cleaning, and chickens outside Hong Kong will be required to be certified by Chinese veterinarians as free from the virus. **********However, because the border with the rest of China is now increasingly porous, thousands of chickens are smuggled into Hong Kong daily, according to reports in local newspapers. **********Meanwhile, detailed genetic testing of the virus found in seven victims has been done by the C.D.C. in Atlanta. Thousands of blood tests, hundreds of interviews and throat cultures of relatives and acquaintances of flu victims have been taken in an effort to determine the precise transmission of the virus. **********In the two newest cases announced today, both victims are infants -- 2 and 3 years old -- who are cousins of one of the confirmed influenza cases, a child of 5. And while the cases are too recent for officials to be certain how the children contracted the virus, Dr. Chan said that they possibly  caught it from the first victim. **********''It's possible they live together at grandma's place and play together,'' she said. Both were reported in satisfactory condition at a local hospital. **********Dr. Fukuda said that the flu, which in this case produces classic flu symptoms of high fever, sneezing, coughing and aching, has ''an attack rate highest among children. Kids are in much more contact with other kids.'' **********If the virus is spreading from human to human it is doing so inefficiently, Dr. Fukuda said. **********''If you have efficient transmission,'' he said, ''you tend to see hundreds or thousands of cases fairly quickly.'' **********''It is an unusual virus,'' he added, ''and there is a lot we don't understand about how it appeared, why it appeared and how it is being communicated.'' **********While the epicenter of the new influenza strain is not certain, most scientists here believe it originated in the chicken farms of neighboring Guangdong Province, from where 80,000 to 100,000 chickens are brought into Hong Kong daily. **********At the wholesale market where Mr. Chow has worked for 40 years, all of the birds come from outside Hong Kong.

Earlier this year, balances were not updated for a full week because of problems with its computers. After an investigation, regulators ordered the company to begin following a wide range of prudent computer practices. In particular, they referred to the company's apparent lack of preparation for problems that are expected in computer programs that have not been modified to process dates after Jan. 1, 2000. **********In a cease-and-desist order -- one of the harshest reprimands regulators can hand out before levying penalties -- Putnam-Greene was told to end a long list of practices that included operating ''with inadequate and unreliable electronic information systems.'' It was also ordered to upgrade its systems and insure proper backup and disaster recovery policies. Putnam-Greene officials said they had already addressed the most serious problems and were at work on the remaining issues. **********Because of short cuts taken in the past by software programmers throughout the computer world, many systems still in use can read only the last two digits of the year -- ''75,'' for example, instead of 1975. If not corrected through a painstaking process, the software in such computers will read the ''00'' in 2000 as the year 1900, resulting in all sorts of miscalculations. This problem could be especially disruptive for the banking industry, which has spent billions of dollars to enable its computers to handle dates in the new millennium. Most major United States banks are expected to be prepared to enter the next century, but experts say many foreign banks and smaller ones in this country are so far behind that many risk grinding to a halt. **********Banking experts said that by using the harsh penalty of a cease-and-desist order, the regulators were sending a message.

''But we will not hesitate to use them if other means are unsuccessful in obtaining the required redemption for the year 2000 problems.'' **********At Putnam-Greene, the weeklong computer problem led regulators to conduct a full audit of the banking company's computer system. **********''Looking back, this was a blessing in disguise,'' said Joe P. Hudson, the executive vice president of the Farmers and Merchants Bank, the largest of Putnam-Greene's three banks. ''They said 'Look, you all need a new computer,' '' he said.

Chernomyrdin to delay the sale, one of Russia's most powerful banks plunged ahead today with an auction for one of the state's most valuable assets. **********Not surprisingly, since a subsidiary of Oneksim Bank was managing the bids, Oneksim Bank won 38 percent of Norilsk Nickel, one of the world's largest producers of nickel, copper and platinum. **********The bank's $250 million bid won easily -- Oneksim Bank had barred foreign investors and had only one competitor, a little-known Russian industrial consortium. **********The auction itself was a throwback to the kind of insider privilege and backdoor maneuvering that has tainted past Government efforts to sell off state property. **********But paradoxically, it seems far less contentious than last month's open and highly competitive auction of the state telecommunications giant. Oneksim Bank won that battle, only to unleash a bitter war with other powerful banks that lost out. **********Worried about those political repercussions, Mr. Chernomyrdin said on Monday that the Norilsk auction should be postponed. Oneksim Bank lobbied heavily today and was finally given the green light from the Prime Minister to go through with the auction. **********The way Oneksim won the auction today is unlikely to dismay rival bankers, who were not interested in the problem-ridden mining and smelting giant -- or in fair play. But Oneksim's latest acquisition could discredit the Government's pledge to even the playing field in the notoriously murky field of privatization. **********Last month, Oneksim Bank unleashed a political bloodbath when it joined a Russian and Western consortium to win 25 percent of Svyazinvest, the state-owned telecommunications giant. **********First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais insisted that the Svyazinvest auction, at least, had been fair and that the highest bid ($1.9 billion) had won. **********But the losing consortium, which included a banking and media tycoon with close ties to the Kremlin, Vladimir Gusinsky, viewed its defeat as a betrayal and began a campaign to discredit Oneksim Bank and the Government officials who supported the winners. **********Most economists agreed that the Svyazinvest sale met Western standards of fairness and disclosure, but few view today's auction in the same light. And the Russian state property committee, the agency that oversees privatization and finally allowed the sale to go through, immediately hedged its bets when the results were announced. **********''The fact that the auction has taken place will not prevent the prosecutor's office, on the Government's behalf, from disputing the results in court,'' said Sergei Molozhavny, deputy head of the committee. **********Oneksim Bank won the right to manage the Government's 38 percent share of Norilsk Nickel in 1995, part of a so-called loans-for-shares program that has become a symbol of the favoritism and inequities that have troubled privatization. **********Led by Oneksim Bank's chairman, Viktor Potanin, who a year later briefly served as a Deputy Prime Minister, a group of Kremlin-favored banks struck a deal offering loans to the cash-starved Russian Government in exchange for trusteeship of some of the country's most valuable metal and oil companies. **********When those assets came up for auction, the banks that managed them usually won the bid -- often at a fraction of the market value. **********After obtaining the shares, Oneksim Bank has struggled to improve management of the huge, debt-ridden plant in Norilsk, which despite its huge reserves of nickel, palladium and other metals and $6 billion in sales last year, is plagued with problems. **********But the bank, which wrote the rules for loans-for-shares program, was one of its biggest winners, taking among other things Norilsk and Sidanko, a major oil company, in the free-for-all. The auction today was merely the bank's effort to consolidate a victory won two years ago. **********And today, the bank's clout is considerable. Russian television networks reported that Mr. Potanin, the Oneksim chairman, had met privately with Mr. Chernomyrdin today and dissuaded him from delaying the auction. **********The one other company permitted to compete in the auction, Peredovye Promyshlennye Tekhnologii, did not contest its defeat.

Whereas most collection agencies can only threaten to sue, the lawyers actually do. **********Applying mass-production techniques, law firms will often receive thousands of cases a month from credit card issuers and other national lenders and pass them on to lawyers licensed in each state. **********Linda Straub Lacey, a paralegal for Gary Becker, a collections lawyer in Minneapolis, taps a few buttons on a personal computer. Its modem squeaks and squawks for a minute or so, as the machine gathers the pertinent information on two dozen debtors of the day. A few more taps at the keyboard and the information is sent to a word processor that will print a form letter demanding payment. **********If the debtor does not respond -- and most don't -- the same word processor will print a lawsuit and send it out. If the debtor still does not respond -- and, again, most don't -- Ms. Lacey will go to court for an award judgment. That, in turn, will enable her computer to write the most important document, a letter to an employer, garnishing the debtor's wages. **********Even that is no guarantee that the creditor will be repaid in full, or even see a penny. Federal law says that no more than 25 percent of a person's take-home wages can be seized in this way. And some claims, like child support, take precedence over bad debt. Moreover, any given creditor often has to fight over the spoils with other lenders. **********''I have some payroll people call me and say there are six garnishments ahead of me,'' Ms. Lacy says. ''Do I want to wait in line?'' **********In Minnesota, a lender can garnish wages for 70 days, then has to go to the back of the lien. As a result of all the constraints, Mr. Becker said his firm collected money on only two of every five judgments it won. **********''If someone had been scraping by on $400 a week, and you garnish $100 a week, they may not be able to live on $300, so they consider bankruptcy,'' he said. **********For all the difficulty of wringing relatively small sums out of individual debtors, the scale of the effort can mean big money for the firms that do it. Typically, they charge a commission of 20 percent to 25 percent of the money they collect. **********They are working on ways to deal with bankruptcy, too.

The ''good guy'' program offers fresh credit to bankrupt people in return for their paying off some old debt. The ''bad guy'' program, by contrast, seeks to collect debt that is not protected by bankruptcy law, such as that incurred no more than 60 days before a filing or under fraudulent circumstances. **********''We are chasing people who have abused credit before bankruptcy,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/20/business/new-interpublic-and-omnicom-units.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-06-20", "snippet": "Think New Ideas, interactive shop in which Omnicom Group owns minority stake, completes acquisition of Fathom Advertising; Interpublic Group of Companies forms Coleman Group Worldwide, network of companies specializing in corporate identity and pa...", "word_count": 270, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Interpublic And Omnicom Units", "print_headline": "New Interpublic And Omnicom Units", "body_text": " **********Two agency companies said yesterday that they had expanded in the interactive marketing and corporate identity fields. **********Think New Ideas in Los Angeles and New York, an interactive shop in which Omnicom Group owns a minority stake, completed the acquisition of Fathom Advertising in Los Angeles, formerly the Ketchum Advertising Los Angeles unit of Omnicom.

Peugeot executives in Bombay declined to comment. **********The French carmaker's woes in India are the second blow to its Asia strategy. Peugeot also is winding up operations in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou after an unsuccessful 10-year run. **********Car sales in India have failed to grow as quickly as manufacturers expected since 1993, when New Delhi opened the national market. **********None of the foreign players, including Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and Daewoo Corp., is making money yet. **********But industry analysts say Peugeot has made some critical mistakes. **********Despite a one-year start over Ford and GM, it underestimated the competition; Peugeot's model, the 309, is unpopular, and its partner is a financially weak, family-run business struggling to survive in a liberalized economy. **********What's more, early this month Peugeot took Premier to court to try to block a separate joint venture with an Italian rival, Fiat SpA. **********\"To gain market share in a place like India, you have to pump in a lot of money and be patient,\" said N. Sreenivasan, an auto analyst at Jardine Fleming Brokerage. \"Peugeot does not seem to be sure of its strategy for India.\" **********For now, the company is sticking with the 309, a model that Indian consumers are well aware has been phased out in Europe. **********Mr. Adenis-Lamarre said research had indicated that the model repre- **********sented the correct \"tradeoff\" between affordability and style for price-sensitive Indians. But poor sales suggest otherwise. **********\"Peugeot took a colonial approach,\" said Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Auto India magazine in Bombay. \"They figured that after driving old cars for so long, Indians wouldn't mind driving a discontinued model. But today in India, a car is an icon of who you are and how well you are doing.\" **********Not all of its troubles are Peugeot's fault. Intermittent strikes at the Premier plant near Bombay where the 309 is assembled disrupted output for several months last year. The strikes, which also affected another Premier plant, further debilitated the Indian partner. **********\"We don't have deep enough pockets to solve our own problems and also contribute to the joint venture with Peugeot,\" said Maitreya Doshi, managing director of Premier. **********The situation is so dire that in recent months the cash-strapped venture has not been able to afford components from the parent company in France to keep up production. Only 3,000 309s have rolled off the assembly line since late 1995. **********Peugeot and Premier each took a 32 percent stake in the project, with the rest held by financial institutions and the public. The initial Peugeot investment amounted to about dollars 75 million, and the project has received no fresh funds since. Instead of cash, Premier contributed one of its two factories. **********Sources close to the venture say that Peugeot pledged this year to invest more \u2014 if Premier put up money too. Short of cash, Premier offered instead to sell out entirely to Peugeot. **********But after extensive negotiations over price, Peugeot decided it was willing to acquire only a majority stake. **********Premier refused. That would mean, Mr. Doshi said, \"holding a huge financial investment without having any management control over the business.\" **********On top of the financial discord, Peugeot and Premier now are facing off in court over Premier's plans to build the Fiat Uno passenger car. **********Peugeot gave its tacit consent to a 1995 deal between Premier and Fiat under which Premier would be licensed to assemble the Uno. Under that agreement, the Italian car giant was not to own any equity in the venture. **********A few months ago, however, Fiat agreed to invest in the Uno project and acquire majority control. **********\"Fiat will treat the project like its own baby,\" said Mr. Doshi, whose company is to retain a 49 percent stake in the venture and a role in management. **********Premier and Peugeot disagreed over whether the Fiat venture violated a no-compete clause in their agreement. **********The court issued an injunction Sept. 5 that forced Premier to cancel a meeting at which it was to seek shareholder approval for the Fiat alliance. Premier has appealed the ruling. **********Meanwhile, Premier and Peugeot have reopened negotiations over the sale of Premier's stake. **********Unlike Peugeot, Fiat is clearly bullish on India. The Uno project is part of Fiat's plan to invest dollars 1 billion in several businesses here over the next five years, and a fully owned Fiat subsidiary is expected to begin manufacturing its Palio model here by late 1999. **********\"The Fiat group has decided to make India a key element in its worldwide industrial strategy,\" the company's chief executive, Paolo Cantarella, said during the most recent of his three visits to India. **********Peugeot's chairman, Jacques Calvet, has yet to visit the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/19/business/worldbusiness/IHT-media-markets-europes-studios-take-on-hollywood.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Ipsen", "pub_date": "1997-03-19", "snippet": "After decades of eking out a third-rate existence in the shadow of the Hollywood studios, Europe's film and television producers are breaking into the big time. .

Even in Southern California, studio bosses have felt the first stirrings of the new tide. **********\"In my opinion, Hollywood is coming awfully close to missing the international boat,\" Jeff Sagansky, the president of Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., said in a speech last month. What is more, he said that a handful of French, German and British media concerns, such as Kirch Group in Germany, TF1 SA in France and Carlton Communications PLC, \"are now firmly in charge of Europe's entertainment future.\" That process has advanced furthest in television production. \"The old phenomenon of American television series appearing in British prime time is almost a thing of the past now,\" said Nigel Walmsley, chairman of Carlton Television. **********\"A successful domestic program will consistently outdraw American series and get 40 to 50 percent of the viewers.\" **********Familiar faces, places and story lines account for some of the new European edge. A steady increase in the quality of those programs has also helped. Inspired by Hollywood, Europeans have edged away from their dialogue-heavy stage-inspired productions and have moved in the direction of faster-paced and more visual fare. **********\"We are also using better-looking actors now,\" said Mr. Koerbelin. **********The sheer proliferation of new outlets for programs has also helped. Fifteen years ago, shows like \"Starsky & Hutch\" and \"Dallas\" dominated TV ratings across Europe. Back then, most Europeans only had access to one or two state-owned stations. National markets have since been thrown open to a profusion of independent commercial stations, all hungry for new programs. **********\"In the last decade, French television production has grown to three or four times what it was,\" said Stephane Sperry, executive vice president for programming at Canal Plus SA. That growth is still accelerating. Two years ago, for instance, both Kirch and Carlton produced 400 hours of original programming. This year, they will each produce 500 hours. **********This year, Carlton will spend pounds 170 million (dollars 269.8 million) making programs ranging from \"Inspector Morse\" to \"Bramwell,\" a Victorian-era medical drama. Many of those will find their way to prime time slots on Britain's largest television channel, ITV, which will spend pounds 800 million on programs this year, pounds 750 million of it for British-produced programs. **********\"People prefer local productions,\" said Ludvig Zusalm, head of international production at Columbia Tristar, a subsidiary of Sony Corp., in Munich. \"They want to see their own stories and their own actors.\" **********Alone among the Hollywood studios, Columbia Tristar has made it a top priority to give Europeans what they want. It began in 1992 by rewriting scripts of the American comedy series \"Who's the Boss?\" and remaking it in Britain under the title of \"The Upper Hand.\" **********Next, the studio took its concept of what the industry calls \"format adaptations\" to Germany, producing German versions of everything from \"Maude\" to \"Married With Children.\" When audiences and critics alike panned those efforts, Columbia began producing original German fare. The first offspring of that effort, a half-hour comedy series called \"The Campers,\" made its debut to good reviews last month. **********Having made the leap into local production, however, Columbia must now confront the same problem long faced by the Europeans \u2014 the unlikelihood of finding big audiences for programs outside their home markets. Shows like the German detective series \"Derrik,\" which has found a mass audience in France and in Italy, are rare. **********Working in English gives British producers a huge advantage, especially in the rich American market where dubbed programs are poorly received. For that reason, bigger-budget Continental productions, such as Kirch's dollars 120 million series on the Bible, are almost always shot in English and frequently feature big-name American or English stars. **********Britain's language edge helps explain why the country boasts the largest and most successful television-production industry outside America. Still, with international sales last year of less than dollars 400 million compared with Hollywood's dollars 4 billion, Britain's television producers have a long way to go. **********Producing almost exclusively for their home markets, Europeans can still make good money in television production but not the vast profits posted by Hollywood. Andrea Kirkby, a media analyst at Daiwa Europe in London, lauded the Europeans for the improved quality of their programs but said the industry was not yet equipped to compete on American terms. \"They have produced some hits,\" she said, \"but they are still not set up to keep grinding 'em out like Hollywood does.\" **********But that is changing. The proliferation of television channels, which soon will switch into high gear with the introduction of digital-television systems in major European markets, appears to guarantee a sellers' market in television programs for some time to come. **********To meet that demand the Europeans are planning major expansions.

The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.82 point, to 951.64. **********''I think it makes sense for investors to be wary of what's happening,'' said Barbara Marcin, senior portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management. **********Although American multinational corporations receive only a small percentage of their earnings from Asia, Ms. Marcin believes that the downturn in that region could have a broader impact worldwide by damping demand for other countries' products as well. **********Asian markets continued to steady early today. At the midday recess in trading, the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks was ahead by 290.41 points, or 1.81 percent, at 16,335.96. **********South Korean stocks ended their morning session down 2.32 points, or a half of 1 percent, at 436.38, while Hong Kong stocks were little changed in early trading. **********Despite the calm in Asian stock markets, Japan's financial problems are worrying some strategists in the United States. **********''This development can't be overlooked; it's not a transitory event,'' Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Smith Barney said of the recent bank and brokerage firm failures in Japan. But, investors and analysts are having a difficult time gauging the impact because ''we don't know how much Asia is going to slow down and we don't know what industries and companies are going to be affected.'' **********As a result, being wary of multinationals is an ''appropriate first response,'' Mr. Acuff added. **********And comments from Asian and American leaders at the Asia Pacific economic conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, did not totally reassure investors that the crisis was under control, said Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Kansas City, Kan. **********''The Canada conversations were mostly to say that the central banks are prepared to insure liquidity in the event of more problems,'' Mr. Herrmann said. **********''It's good for depositors, but I don't know that that's all that reassuring'' for investors, he added. **********While the Asian crisis unfolds, Mr. Herrmann believes investors should avoid cyclical stocks, which would perform poorly if the Asian economic slowdown is a significant drag on American growth, and companies in the capital goods sector, such as heavy-equipment manufacturers. **********Instead, they should focus on companies with more predictable earnings from domestic sources and little exposure to emerging markets. **********''I think there are opportunities on a long-term basis, but I wouldn't want to be calling the bottom,'' he said. Clearer signs of the impact on United States companies may not come until first-quarter earnings reports in 1998, he said. **********Some investors seem to be in Mr. Herrmann's camp. Alan Bond, chief investment officer for Bond Procope Capital Managagment which oversees $500 million, is reducing his exposure to technology shares like Applied Materials, the leading maker of semiconductor maufacturing equipment, and will not increase his holdings of money center banks with exposure to Asia. **********Instead, he's buying retailers like Costco and regional banks like Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati, Sovereign Bancorp in Wyomissing, Pa. and Northern Trust Corporation in Chicago. **********''We're not running for the hills, but it's certainly a run for cover,'' Mr. Bond said of his more domestic stance. **********Elizabeth Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear, Stearns, said investors could consider multinational companies with limited exposure to Asia such as American Express and Hewlett-Packard. For Hewlett, ''Europe is probably more important to them than Asia,'' she added. **********Ms. Marcin of Citibank said she believed that some declines among multinationals may have been overdone and investors should consider picking up capital goods stocks like Deere, Boeing and Raytheon. Having exposure to overseas markets is still ''an attractive long-term quality for a company to have,'' she said.

For American viewers at least, it was a reminder of the differences that remain despite a multitude of agreements and shared hopes. **********But few Chinese are apt to learn about this telling moment because the pointed exchange was not mentioned at all in the news coverage here. All week the Government-controlled television and newspapers have extolled the happy moments of the trip and glossed over less pleasant tidings. **********Viewers this evening of China's only national television newscast watched the Clintons and Gores meet Mr. Jiang and his wife, sat through nearly the entire American national anthem and watched the 21-gun salute. They heard a long summary of the leaders' joint statement, covering everything from environmental agreements to the desire for world peace. **********The news conference itself was shown only briefly, and the crowd of protesters across the street from the White House was not mentioned at all. From the long and lively press conference, the Government-run China Central Television showed only a moment of each leader's statement about constructive cooperation, and a Chinese reporter lobbing Mr. Jiang a softball of a question. **********The television networks and newspapers here -- all Government controlled -- have been remarkably consistent. The images given the Chinese people have been resolutely upbeat, with special emphasis on the pomp and symbols. The newspapers have sometimes mentioned, amid the long lists of achievements, that the two countries have differences on human rights, but then report only Mr. Jiang's justifications. **********Mr. Jiang clearly wanted this trip to give him new stature as a leader, and China new stature as a world player. Each day's ceremonies have been featured atop page one of every major newspaper, crowding down news about the stock market chaos in Hong Kong, and they have filled the opening minutes of every news broadcast. **********''The goverment sees this visit as a very big event, and they give the media very detailed directions about what to print,'' said Wu Guoguang, a former editorial writer of the People's Daily who left China in 1989 and now teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. **********Longtime China-watchers in the diplomatic community here are not surprised by the timid and uniform press coverage, a habit of Communism that has not waned in the new era of economic opening. The Chinese leaders need time to mull over the results of this American visit, said a Western diplomat, and in the meantime would find it risky to allow attention for anything so heated as Wednesday's Presidential retorts. **********The trip has produced one mystery. Mr. Jiang's hourlong swim in Hawaii, a feat of stamina by any measure, would seem designed to impress the Chinese people and harked back to famous swims by Chairman Mao and Deng Xiaoping. Yet while the Western and the Hong Kong press gave wide coverage to the event, someone high in the Chinese government apparently decided that this would not strike the right tone at home: Chinese television and newspapers ignored it. **********A possible answer was suggested by Mr. Wu, the former People's Daily editor. He recalled that several years ago Li Peng, the Prime Minister, took a swim in the Dead Sea during a visit to the Middle East. The publication of a picture of him lolling in the water coincided, unfortunately, with a period of disastrous flooding in southern China, and Mr. Li's public image took a dive. **********''Maybe the papers learned a lesson from that,'' Mr. Wu said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/10/business/national-semiconductor-stock-plunges.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-12-10", "snippet": "Shares of National Semiconductor Corp tumble nearly 12 percent after company reports mixed results for its fiscal second quarter; shares fall $3.625 each, to $27; for quarter ended Nov 23, National earned $28.9 million, up 10.7 percent from $26.1 ...", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "National Semiconductor Stock Plunges", "print_headline": "National Semiconductor Stock Plunges", "body_text": " **********Shares of National Semiconductor tumbled nearly 12 percent today after the company reported mixed results for its fiscal second quarter. **********Revenue and earnings from its core chip business were well above most analysts' estimates, but there were steeper-than-anticipated losses from the Cyrix Corporation, which National acquired in July. **********National Semiconductor shares fell $3.625 each, to $27.

Scheffer, the Clinton Administration's Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues, stepped slowly through a field of wooden crosses marking the spot where Hutu extremists slaughtered thousands of Tutsi in 1994. **********In a light drizzle, he bent over and struggled to right one of several crosses, worn by weather and time, that had fallen into the weeds. It stood for a moment, teetered, and fell again. Riding back to Kigali, he asked an embassy official if there might not be a way for the United States to pay for stone grave markers. **********''Because they aren't going to last like that,'' he said. **********It was a modest gesture but for Mr. Scheffer a fitting one. As Ambassador at Large, he has been handed the task of insuring that the sorts of atrocities carried out in Rwanda -- and all too often in other conflicts around the world -- do not fade into history like the crosses on the hillside. **********His is an entirely new position, the first devoted exclusively to the most egregious violations of humanity. **********It was the brainchild of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, long an advocate of international justice, to give the issue of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity a higher priority in American foreign policy, separating it from the State Department's bureau overseeing human rights generally. **********She even put Mr. Scheffer's office on the seventh floor of the State Department, which in the hierarchy of the place puts it very near the Secretary's -- a sign seen all the way to embassies here in East Africa that his job has influence. **********The question now is whether Mr. Scheffer -- an earnest, talkative lawyer from Norman, Okla., who was confirmed by the Senate on July 31 and sworn in a week later -- can make the job one of the signatures of Ms. Albright's tenure as Secretary of State, as she would like, and not just another well-meaning idea that gets lost in the pragmatic trade-offs of diplomacy. **********Diane F. Orentlicher, director of the War Crimes Research Office at American University Washington College of Law, said that by creating the position, Ms. Albright had committed herself to real results, not just symbolic ones. Otherwise, she said, she will face charges that the appointment was nothing more than a response to pressure in Congress to do more, especially in Bosnia. **********''In the best sense, the Administration has stuck its proverbial neck out,'' she said. **********On his inaugural trip as Ambassador, which was to take him from East Africa and Congo to the Balkans and then the Hague, Mr. Scheffer learned firsthand that mere gestures, however heartfelt,  would go only so far in a country where more than 500,000 people  died in one of history's worst episodes of genocide. **********A day after his visit to the cemetery in Nyanza, he found himself sharply questioned at the American cultural center here in Kigali by an invited group of Rwandan dignitaries more interested in justice than symbolism. **********''I don't think the problem is money,'' declared Tomas Ndahiro, a journalist with Rwanda's quasi-official radio, echoing the doubts many Tutsi have about the world's zeal to punish those responsible for the massacres. ''I think it is a lack of moral commitment.'' **********Mr. Scheffer, for his part, acknowledges that he is starting his job fighting against the notion of irrelevance. ''It is my responsibility to demonstrate this is more than symbolic,'' he said in an interview during his visit here. **********His initial focus will be on the nascent war crimes tribunals now trying to prosecute those who carried out the worst crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, but his portfolio extends far beyond the Balkans and Central Africa, to Iraq and Cambodia, and any other place where war crimes may yet arise. **********And it includes Ms. Albright's ultimate goal of creating a permanent international criminal court, a controversial idea in Congress and elsewhere because of its potential to reach over sovereign borders. **********Mr. Scheffer, who is 44, is a lawyer who specialized in international law in private practice for seven years with Coudert Brothers of New York City, and later researched and taught the subject at Columbia, Harvard and the Georgetown University Law Center. **********More important, as Ms. Albright's top aide in Washington while she was the chief American delegate to the United Nations, he represented her at the regular ''deputies committee'' meetings of the top aides to President Clinton's foreign policy team. **********As Ms. Albright's counsel, Mr. Scheffer was also a central player in the Administration's policy on war crimes, having a large hand in Security Council deliberations that led to the tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the first international courts to try cases of war crimes since the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals after World War II. **********After the massacres of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995, Mr. Scheffer  helped pry loose aerial reconnaissance photos from the intelligence agencies that Ms. Albright used to warn Bosnian Serbs publicly not to tamper with evidence of war crimes. ''We will be watching,'' Ms. Albright said at the time. **********In June, after he was nominated but not yet confirmed for his new job, Mr. Scheffer led the Administration's scramble to find a way to bring Pol Pot of Cambodia to some international trial. It was Mr. Scheffer who identified Canada's law on genocide as a possible avenue for trying the Cambodian.  Nothing came of the idea, however, as Pol Pot is believed to remain under Khmer Rouge control after a brief show trial in July. **********In debates in the Administration, as he struggles to bring attention to an issue that had been an afterthought, Mr. Scheffer must often juggle competing interests in the State Department and with other agencies, notably the Pentagon, which has clashed with the department over how aggressively NATO troops should pursue indicted war-crime suspects in Bosnia. **********''The Administration consists of many people with many different viewpoints,'' said Ms. Orentlicher of American University. ''He has the job of making the case for doing what must be done.'' **********With the rank of ambassador, Mr. Scheffer now also has the authority to deal directly with foreign governments. In mid-September, he met with officials from Rwanda's Tutsi-led Government to make the case for better cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. And he went to Burundi to warn President Pierre Buyoya's Government to stop summary executions and other abuses if it ever hoped to persuade the United Nations to create another international tribunal to prosecute those who killed 50,000 Tutsi in 1993. **********''You have to deal with the issue of accountability,'' he said in Burundi, ''or you will never end the violence here.'' **********In his appearance at the cultural center here and over lunch with members of Rwanda's nascent bar association, Mr. Scheffer said he had started his inaugural trip as Ambassador in Africa deliberately because Rwanda's tribunal has received far less attention and support than the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is based in The Hague. **********''The most challenging test for the rule of law in our generation is the genocide of 1994 that consumed Rwanda,'' he said at the cultural center, promising to do more to give the victims a sense of justice. **********The gap between promise and reality, however, was clear when he visited a church in Ntarama, south of Kigali, where the decomposing bodies of more than 5,000 victims of the genocide remain to this day as a macabre memorial to the killing. Mr. Scheffer called it ''a memorial to the living dead.'' **********A Tutsi woman, Christine Mukaruyenzi, guided him through the church, strewn with bones and clothing stained with dried blood. It was in the church on April 15, 1994, that she and her eight children had gone to hide when the killings started. Only she survived. ''We hope the world will never forget this,'' she told him. **********But it was clear there was little chance that all those responsible for the killings would face justice. ''It's not really a mass murder,'' Mr. Scheffer said as he stepped over shattered, decaying bones and skulls, many showing the machete blows that killed the victims. ''It is individual murder, person by person, that becomes mass murder.'' **********Mr. Scheffer said it was vital to create a greater sense of justice and thus, hopefully, reconciliation in Rwanda, by shoring up the tribunal for Rwanda. The tribunal's failure to complete a case, nearly three years after it was established, has created animosity with Rwanda's Government that Mr. Scheffer sought to ease during his meetings with Government officials. **********To that end, he stopped at the tribunal's headquarters in a grimy cement conference center in Arusha, Tanzania, before coming to Rwanda. **********In a series of meetings, Mr. Scheffer chided the tribunal's judges for moving cases too slowly -- it has only three trials under way, and they are in various states of suspension -- and he deplored the dismal working conditions of the building itself, which lacks even reliable phone service. **********At the same time, he sounded more sympathetic than critical, comparing its efforts to the effort made by the United States to try Timothy McVeigh. ''What we're talking about in Rwanda,'' he said, ''is more than 500,000 murder cases.'' **********Beyond the two tribunals, Mr. Scheffer has long lists of priorities for an office that is just getting off the ground. **********He said he wanted to focus attention on Burundi and Congo, to hold Pol Pot accountable for the killing fields of Cambodia and to establish at least ''a record'' if not a prosecution of war crimes that the United States believes Iraq committed against the Kurds and the Kuwaitis. **********Mr. Scheffer's work has already clashed with Realpolitik. After leaving Kigali, Mr. Scheffer went to Congo, where he deliberately avoided a public confrontation with the Government of President Laurent Kabila, who is fighting with the United Nations over an investigation into atrocities committed during his alliance's overthrow of Mobutu Sese Seko. **********Eager to maintain ties with Mr. Kabila and avoid alienating his African allies, American officials have limited their public criticism of his opposition to the United Nations investigation. **********''There are times,'' Mr. Scheffer said, ''when I need to be low-profile to accomplish what we want.'' **********Mr. Scheffer said he did not expect to be the last Ambassador at Large for War Crimes. ''If human nature continues to be of the same character as it was in the 20th century,'' he said, ''there will be more than enough work to do.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/22/business/the-old-fashioned-almanac-thrives-in-the-age-of-the-internet.html": {"writer_name": "Sreenath Sreenivasan", "pub_date": "1997-12-22", "snippet": "Publishers remain enthusiastic about business of almanacs, especially general-interest books like World Almanac and Book of Facts and Information Please Almanac; economics of almanacs is appealing to publishers, because they can bring out new book...", "word_count": 1284, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Old-Fashioned Almanac Thrives in the Age of the Internet", "print_headline": "The Old-Fashioned Almanac Thrives in the Age of the Internet", "body_text": " **********In the library of Oak Hill Elementary School in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kan., one set of books gets used more than most: the almanacs. **********''For class work and even for fun, the kids love to sit and read them for hours,'' said Sharon Coatney, the school's librarian. ''Children are fascinated with trivia and new things. They love to ask each other, 'did you know such and such,' and almanacs give them a lot of such and suches.'' **********Almanac publishers have counted on schools to introduce new generations of buyers to their books. Even in the era of CD-ROM's and the Internet, with their promise of vast storehouses of information, publishers remain enthusiastic about the business of almanacs, especially general-interest books like the World Almanac and Book of Facts and the Information Please Almanac. **********Two big publishers entered the almanac market this year, bringing out The Wall Street Journal Almanac and The New York Times Almanac. **********The economics of almanacs is appealing to publishers, because they can bring out new books every year at a relatively low cost. Although each year's edition will include new articles and other updated information, much of the data can be recycled from year to year. Moreover, although almanac sales are quite large by publishing standards, and there are no big-name authors demanding huge advances and royalties. **********There is, of course, a wide variety of almanacs available, with some focusing mainly on sports or entertainment -- or on the weather as the Old Farmer's Almanac does. But the most popular are the general-interest almanacs, which compile hundreds of thousands of facts about a broad range of topics, from abortion to the zodiac. An estimated two million of these almanacs are sold each year, for less than $11 apiece. **********And a large portion of those sales occur during the holiday season. The new almanacs dated 1998 appeared in bookstores in November and early December, and they are favored by some gift shoppers. **********''These books are phenomenal sellers, especially during this season,'' said Robert Wietrak, a vice president of merchandise at Barnes & Noble. His stores sell 75 percent of their almanacs from November through January. **********''Everyone likes almanacs and they make great stocking stuffers,'' he said. ''We will sell about 300,000 almanacs altogether. That would make almanacs one of our top 10 nonfiction books for the year.'' **********The giant in this category is the 130-year-old World Almanac, published by Primedia Reference Inc. It sells about 1.2 million copies each year, more than double the sales of its nearest competitor, the Information Please Almanac, published by Information Please L.L.C. **********Now, Ballantine Books, a unit of Advance Publications that publishes The Wall Street Journal Almanac, and Penguin Reference Books, a subsidiary of Pearson P.L.C. that publishes The New York Times Almanac, are each betting that the name of a big national newspaper will provide a competitive edge. **********''The almanac publishing business is a tough game,'' said John W. Wright, general editor of The New York Times Almanac. ''To market against the World Almanac, you need another brand name, and that's where The Times comes in.'' **********Ronald J. Alsop, editor of The Wall Street Journal Almanac, has a similar view. ''Taking on the existing almanacs is not easy because you have to be truly distinctive to stand out,'' he said. **********To that end, The Wall Street Journal Almanac has adopted some of the look and feel of the newspaper, with the articles and charts being provided by The Journal's staff. **********Mr. Alsop, who is also a news editor at The Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones & Company, contended that his almanac was more forward-looking than its competitors. ''Other almanacs have the history of the Liberty Bell,'' he said, ''but is that really what people want to know? We have information that is relevant to people as we approach the year 2000. For example, we tell you what the fastest-growing occupations will be between now and 2005.'' **********The New York Times Almanac, meanwhile, portrays itself as the ''almanac of record,'' and Mr. Wright said the book reflected the newspaper's ''thorough coverage of the U.S. and the world.'' **********Unlike The Wall Street Journal Almanac, which was created from scratch, The New York Times Almanac has some of its roots in a prior book, the Universal Almanac. **********Mr. Wright was previously the editor of the Universal Almanac. Its publisher, Andrews & McMeel, decided to discontinue the book with the 1997 issue. The Universal Almanac was well respected and comprehensive, but its sales were lower than those of its competitors. **********But Mr. Wright owned the rights to the content of the Universal Almanac, so he approached The New York Times Company with the idea of creating a new almanac with the newspaper's name on it. Penguin was then brought in as the publisher. **********The New York Times Almanac includes a good deal of information from the Universal Almanac, although Mr. Wright rejects contentions by rivals that the old almanac is merely repackaged. He noted that some members of The Times news staff contributed articles about the major news events of the year, as well as the maps in the book. **********It is too early to tell whether the new books are making a serious dent in the market share of the older books. Ballantine said its first print run of The Wall Street Journal Almanac was 165,000 copies, while Penguin said it also printed 165,000 copies of The New York Times Almanac. **********The World Almanac also traces its roots to the newspaper business. The first edition of the almanac was published by The New York World in 1868. That almanac ceased in 1876, but Joseph Pulitzer, who acquired The World in 1883, revived the book in 1886, and it has been published since then by various companies. **********By most counts, almanacs tend to be impulse purchases that are not regularly repeated. According to Richard W. Eiger, publisher of the World Almanac, about 20 percent of his customers buy new almanacs every year, and about 50 percent buy new copies every two to three years. **********Mr. Eiger said he was not overly worried by his new competitors. ''We respect the competition and are alert to it,'' he said. **********And Elizabeth Buckley Kubik, general manager of Information Please L.L.C., also showed little concern about the new almanacs. ''We don't consider them players, because we are not sure if they are in it for the long run,'' she said. The Information Please Almanac, which has been published since 1947, is seeking a competitive advantage by providing a midyear update to book buyers who want it. **********Regardless of the competition, Mr. Eiger said the World Almanac would maintain its $500,000 marketing budget. The others are estimated to spend at least $100,000 each. **********He did point out, however, that the World Almanac did not raise its retail price from $9.95 a copy. The others are all $10.95 each. **********Mr. Eiger said he was not surprised that almanacs sell well, even with competition from the Internet and CD-ROM's. ''Our almanac allows you to get to specific information without trawling through dozens of Web sites to find it,'' he said. **********Others have a similar view. ''Finding information on the Internet can be a nightmare,'' said Barbara Berliner, coordinator of NYPL-Express, a fee-based research service of the New York Public Library. ''With an almanac it's quicker, easier and more accurate.'' **********Still, the almanac publishers are developing on-line projects. For example, Ms. Kubik of Information Please said her company had invested ''a seven-figure sum'' to open a World Wide Web site next month. **********Meanwhile, at the Oak Hill Elementary School, the library is acquiring about 30 copies of the 1998 World Almanac. ''As soon as the new books arrive, they are snapped up by the kids,'' Ms. Coatney said.

A slew  of carpenters' hammers echoed through the two main halls this  week: the hall where at midnight on June 30 Beijing's resumption of sovereignty will be made formal, and a second hall where soon after midnight its appointed government will be sworn in. **********Britain's new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, will be here to see the sun set on empire, as will Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, dozens of other foreign ministers and much of China's senior leadership, including President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng, the man reviled here for ordering the violent repression of the Tiananmen Square protests in June 1989. **********But unlike the majority of guests, Ms. Albright will join Mr. Blair in boycotting the subsequent swearing in of Hong Kong's new government, a gesture of protest against China's abolition of the territory's elected legislature and its installation of an appointed assembly, what it is calling the provisional legislature. **********''It wouldn't be appropriate,'' the  State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said earlier this week.  Mr. Blair then announced his decision to join Ms. Albright in her protest. **********Britain's last Governor here, Christopher Patten, the first non-diplomat to hold the post and a former chairman of Britain's Conservative Party, introduced a sweeping range of democratic elections here in recent years, moves that were denounced by Beijing. The mainland Chinese press lathered invective on Mr. Patten for giving Hong Kong's citizens a voice in their own governance, labeling him, among other things, a ''prostitute for a thousand years.'' **********Despite the actions by Washington and London, other Western and Asian democracies have declined to join in the protest, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan. ''We're an independent country,'' said Alexander Downer, Australia's Foreign Minister. ''We'll make up our own minds what we want to do as the Australian Government.'' **********Newspapers here sympathetic to Beijing's plans for Hong Kong were quick to attack Ms. Albright and Mr. Blair.

The premiere was attended by the cream of the future post-colonial elite, including Tung Chee-hwa, the man Beijing has chosen to run the territory, and assorted Communist Party luminaries. **********Xie Jin, the director of the film, equated it with Stephen Spielberg's ''Schindler's List'' -- a comparison he said was valid, because, after all, Queen Victoria, monarch when Hong Kong was ceded to Britain in 1841, was little better than Hitler. **********Notable by their absence were the current leaders of Hong Kong, particularly Governor Patten. Nor were there any representatives of Jardine, Matheson. Jardine's was the company whose shipments of opium to China were guaranteed by British guns in the colonial adventure by which Hong Kong became a prize of empire. **********China's representative at the gala made it clear what the film was all about. ''Hong Kong is about to return to the motherland,'' said Zhang Junsheng, the second-ranking Communist Party official here. ''This is a great event that washes away more than 150 years of shame left by the Opium War. The showing of 'The Opium War' will attract the rapt attention of all the people of Hong Kong.'' **********Well, not all. **********Dennis Eng, film critic of The Hong Kong Standard, struggled to stay awake through the 140 minutes of historic didacticism, after which he wrote, ''The result seems more like a loud cannon blast that disappears into a cloud of smoke.'' **********The film opened on Friday to the general public but is facing stiff competition from the likes of Bruce Willis, Gene Hackman and Winona Rider, all appearing in movies more attuned to Hong Kong tastes. **********Eagerness for Troops **********Beijing has decided, apparently, that Britain will not go gently into its post-colonial night. This week, China decided that it wanted to move the main force of its People's Liberation Army garrison into Hong Kong early, before it resumes control on July 1. **********Already, Beijing has a 200-man unarmed advance unit here to prepare for the expected 10,000 Chinese troops who will be stationed here.  Now, though, Beijing insists that it bring in more troops and weapons early ''so that after the completion of the hand-over ceremony they can take up defense responsibilities,'' according to Beijing-controlled newspapers here. **********Britain immediately dismissed the suggestion, declaring that it retains responsibility for Hong Kong's defense until midnight on June 30. **********In any case, Governor Patten observed, it was unclear what foreign threat Hong Kong was faced with that would require armed Chinese troops. British troops here are known less for being armed with weapons than a pint of beer. **********China's military, though, appears convinced that the United States and Britain are conspiring to undermine Hong Kong. China Defense, an official newspaper of the mainland's military establishment, wrote this week that ''out of a need to maintain its global strategic position, the United States is strengthening its intelligence work in Hong Kong, supporting Hong Kong's Democratic Party and fostering political forces.'' **********The Democratic Party is the largest of the territory's political parties and the party that won the greatest number of seats in the legislative elections of 1995. **********''Before and after Hong Kong's return,'' China Defense wrote, ''some U.S. politicians and intermediaries will certainly stir up trouble over the Hong Kong issue. So-called 'democrats' within Hong Kong society will cooperate from afar with international forces hostile to China.

The only people busier were the locksmiths who were removing old locks and delivering fresh sets of keys to the inheritors of hillside estates. **********But once the grab for property and goods began to extend its fingers down Binza's hillsides into the hot and dusty city of Kinshasa below, where owners of even modest properties were awakened in the night by soldiers with guns who made claims on their belongings, it was not long before the ordinary people of the city were complaining bitterly over the arbitrary powers of the people who claimed to have liberated them. **********This week, Mr. Kabila held a stormy Cabinet meeting in which, Congolese officials say, he repeatedly banged his fist on the table and berated his ministers for their greed. For the record, the next day's newspapers published a laconic communique saying that the President had ''forbidden those in Government to abuse their positions to rob the belongings of others.'' **********But for now, in a land where the equation ''power equals property'' dates at least to King Leopold of Belgium, for whom all of the Congo was a private domain in the 19th century, skepticism over whether Mr. Kabila will be able to instill a new ethic seems far more prevalent than confidence. **********If change is going to come, many here say that there is no better place to start than the Government's Office of Ill-Gotten Goods.

''We are trying to rebuild a ruined state, and are not out for vengeance.

Norwegian Cruise Lines recently rolled out an ad campaign primarily aimed at travel agents that will cost nearly $1 million this quarter. (It will follow up with a national consumer ad campaign in January.) And Royal Caribbean International is spending $5 million for sole sponsorship of the halftime show during the Super Bowl, to be held in San Diego on Jan. 25. **********The Royal Caribbean ads will be aimed in large part at extolling the pleasures of cruising on any of Royal Caribbean's 12 ships or on any of the 5 ships of Celebrity Cruises, which Royal Caribbean acquired last summer. **********''The challenge is to be seen as a global provider of vacation options, not just these two little cruise lines in Miami,'' said Mark Kammerer, director of marketing for Royal Caribbean. ''Next year, our joint revenues will exceed $1.5 billion.'' **********The ads for Royal Caribbean are being created by McKinney & Silver, a unit of the CKS Group in Raleigh, N.C. Celebrity is handled by Harris Drury Cohen, an agency in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that is also working on the Cruise Lines Industry Association campaign. **********Discounting concerns that the price it paid for the Super Bowl sponsorship is akin to putting all of Royal Caribbean's advertising eggs in one basket, Art Sbarsky, Celebrity's senior vice president of marketing, said that at least 85 percent of the millions who watch the halftime show on television have never gone on a cruise. **********Expanding on Mr. Kammerer's theme, Mr. Sbarsky said: ''If we were just a cruise line, our sponsorship wouldn't make economic sense. But we're a huge vacation company.'' Seeing a backdrop of Super Bowl spectators basking in the San Diego sun in midwinter, he said, is likely to make those millions of television viewers think about vacations.  If the ads do their job, that will translate into cruise vacations with Royal Caribbean or Celebrity. **********Sponsorship of the San Diego Super Bowl provides another benefit to Royal Caribbean. ''The following year the Super Bowl will be played in Miami, our backyard, '' Mr. Kammerer said, ''and we have the option for that halftime show.' **********The previous campaign for Norwegian Cruise Lines -- ''It's different out here'' -- created by the Omnicom Group's Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, won awards from the advertising industry. But the ads raised eyebrows in the cruise industry for their sensual imagery, and drew criticism from Bob Dickinson, the president of Carnival  Cruises, the industry giant. Ads that emphasize glamour rather than value, he said, ''send messages that 'I need a $50,000 wardrobe' or that 'I need my breasts augmented or my teeth capped' to go on this cruise line or that.'' **********Norwegian's new ads take a much different tack. **********Created by Young & Rubicam Chicago, which won the account three months ago, the ads in the trade press are intended both to build the Norwegian Cruise Line brand and to differentiate it from other cruise lines and land-based vacations. Its general theme, the ''Norwegian Way,'' highlights the tradition of Norwegian seafaring excellence. **********Thus one ad, with an Old World globe adorned by wooden Viking ships, asks: ''O.K., so Norwegians discovered all the world's sea routes.  But what have they done for you lately?'' The facing page says: ''New routes. New ports. New itineraries.'' **********Another ad shows a partly opened can of sardines on one page, dancing and dining passengers on the other page. ''Ask any Norwegian,'' the headline says. ''It's not the size of the vessel. It's the space per passenger.'' **********A plaque depicted in another ad, obviously aimed at the spate of megaships that cruise lines have added recently, describes the Norwegian Way thus: ''We believe a ship should be a ship, not a floating mall. Authentic, romantic, civilized. Long on choices, not on lines.'' **********It should be noted, however, that the cruise line's Norway, at 1,035 feet, remains the longest cruise ship afloat. But Nina Cohen, vice president of marketing for Norwegian Cruise Lines, said what other Norway loyalists maintain -- that the classic lines and generous amounts of wood used in construction of the ship (which was built in 1960 as the S.S. France) give it an unexpected intimacy. **********Beyond that, she noted that while the company has been Norwegian since it began, ''The Norwegianness has never been used as a raison d'etre.'' **********''In fact,'' she continued, ''we called ourselves N.C.L. Now we're breaking out.'' The company is doing so not just in its ads, but by changing the name of three ships: the Seaward, to Norwegian Sea; Dreamward, to Norwegian Dream, and Windward, to Norwegian Wind. **********''The ads are whimsical, tongue in cheek and relevant,'' Ms. Cohen added. ''How can you not love them?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/03/business/vertical-real-estate.html": {"writer_name": "Andrea Adelson", "pub_date": "1997-11-03", "snippet": "Competition between television broadcasters and wireless communications services gives rise to new sub-industry of radio tower companies; they are vying to tie together far-flung clusters of local transmission antennas into national webs that will...", "word_count": 1160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vertical Real Estate", "print_headline": "Vertical Real Estate", "body_text": " **********The competition between television broadcasters and wireless communication services is giving rise to a new sub-industry of tower companies. They are vying to tie together far-flung clusters of local transmission antennas into national webs that will bring next-generation technology to customers. **********Stunning growth projections for wireless services are drawing big-name investors to this infant industry. With outside investment capital nurturing their national ambitions, these little-known tower companies have been transforming themselves over the last two years into integrated operators that can offer wireless carriers an array of services from finding new sites to building towers to leasing antenna space on underused radio towers. **********''It came from nowhere,'' said Brian G. Coleman, a wireless communication analyst for BT Alex. Brown in San Francisco. **********Among the dominant players in the antenna business are American Tower Systems of Boston; Omni America Wireless L.P. of West Palm Beach, Fla.; Telecom Towers Inc. of Alexandria, Va., and the Castle Tower Corporation and the American Tower Corporation, both based in Houston. **********Demand for transmission towers and antennas is soaring. Driving the demand is the expected shift by the nation's 1,500 television stations to high-definition television and new Federal regulations that allow a handful of wireless services to compete in a single market. So far, just 3 percent of telecommunications traffic is over the current wireless network, most of that cellular phone conversations. But that is expected to change. Already, some of the new wireless services, called personal communications services or P.C.S., are operating, carrying not only phone chatter but Internet data and paging signals. **********The tower companies expect a near-term flurry of activity from broadcasters retrofitting or replacing their existing towers, so-called ''candelabras'' that can support a small cluster of television or radio antennas. A tall tower can be 2,000 feet and cost, on average, $3 million. Even more capital is needed to meet demand from wireless services, whose tiny 2.2 million subscriber base is supposed to increase to 54.3 million in a decade, according to Paul Kagan Associates Inc., a media research firm in Carmel, Calif. **********That sort of consumer acceptance would require adding 80,000 P.C.S. antennas to the 20,000 already built over the last 15 years for cellular customers. P.C.S. antennas, at about $200,00 each, have a range of one to six miles and need to be only 200 feet in the air. By contrast, cellular antennas now are 6 to 12 miles apart. **********But the growing demand for antennas coincides with growing opposition to them for esthetic and health reasons. An increasing number of municipalities have been imposing moratoriums on tower construction, even though part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits banning towers but does not address moratoriums. Tower companies are resorting to such costly ''stealth'' solutions as embedding antennas in clock towers, cemetery crosses and palm trees. Others are striking roof-top management deals, luring owners with the promise that every multistory building will become a revenue-producing cell site. **********Given the zoning hurdles, companies with existing towers are likely to prosper first. ''Most wireless carriers would like to go out and lease 40 towers in a region rather than contacting 40 different landowners,'' Mr. Coleman said. **********Anthony S. Ocepek, chief operating officer of Omni America, said, ''Our goal is to be in all phases of the business.'' The company is being backed by $100 million from Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc., a Dallas investment firm with interests in radio and television stations. **********After four years of trying, construction is about to start on Omni America's first 1,220-foot tower. It will provide digital television signals for Milwaukee's two public broadcasting stations. When completed in 1999, the $7 million tower will be able to support 12 television stations, 14 FM radio stations and 35 wireless services. But it will not fill up for about eight years, Mr. Ocepek said. **********''We think of it as vertical real estate, a vertical shopping mall,'' said Carl E. Hirsch, chief executive of Omni America, which also owns towers in Florida and Ohio. Last month, Omni America acquired a one-third interest in the Kline Iron and Steel Company in Columbia, S.C., one of the few companies that build tall towers. Mr. Hirsch learned firsthand the value of a well-sited tower as chief executive of a company that owned KJOY-FM in Los Angeles in 1985. **********''The hidden jewel was the tower site,'' Mr. Hirsch said. The region's coastal foothills create dead zones for cellular customers. As a result, KJOY's 150-foot tower in the Santa Monica Mountains near Beverly Hills became a prized relay point for cable and cellular providers. ''That turned out to be a bonanza,'' Mr. Hirsch said. Tower revenue rose from $400,000 annually to $2 million before the station was sold in 1989. ''We want to take advantage of inherited sites that are underutilized,'' he said. **********This is a tall order, considering that Omni America's sister companies own 8 television stations and more than 400 radio stations. **********In just the last two years, American Tower Systems, a unit of the American Radio Systems Corporation of Boston, has cobbled together 920 antennas in more than a dozen deals that together cost $316 million. The tower company is to be spun off next year to shareholders of American Radio, which was sold to the Westinghouse Broadcasting Corporation in September. The tower company's pro forma cash flow is expected to be $20 million this year and $35 million next year. **********''If as a company, we can construct 30 big towers a year and generate a 25 to 30 percent return on our investment, that's a secure income stream,'' said Steve Dodge, the chairman and chief executive of American Radio, who will hold the same positions with the spun-off company. **********''You don't have to deal with personalities, unions,'' he said. ''Broadcasting is emotional; its management intensive. By comparison, towers are deaf, dumb and mute. **********There are risks, though, like cash-short customers and the unexpected. For example, General Wireless Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week, unable to pay for the P.C.S. licenses it won in Government auctions. And earlier in the month, a new 2,000-foot tower under construction in Mississippi toppled, sending three employees of Le Blanc Communications Inc. of Canada to their deaths. **********But finding potential investors to help bankroll acquisitions is no problem for tower companies. Telecom Towers, which owns or manages 3,000 sites, has teamed up with Cox Communications Inc. Castle Tower, which bought the British Broadcasting Corporation's transmission sites and has another 3,000 in the United State, is backed by two private investment companies. The American Tower Corporation, which owns and operates 600 towers, was considering a public offering until it found an equity partner in Clear Channel Communications Inc., a broadcaster. **********Mr. Dodge, who will receive $103 million in stock and options when American Tower Systems is spun off, wants to rein in expectations for what is quickly becoming the darling of investors. ''The financial community is impatient to play this industry,'' he said. ''People view it as a way to play the explosive growth in wireless.'' **********He cautioned, ''This is a young business.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/01/business/japanese-phone-giant-buys-a-us-stake.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1997-10-01", "snippet": "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp makes its first significant push into American telecommunications market, agreeing to pay $100 million for minority stake in Teligent Inc, small wireless communications company; NTT is betting that some American...", "word_count": 561, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Phone Giant Buys a U.S. Stake", "print_headline": "Japanese Phone Giant Buys a U.S. Stake", "body_text": " **********Making its first significant push into the American telecommunications market, the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to pay $100 million for a minority stake in Teligent Inc., a small wireless communications company. **********N.T.T., based in Tokyo, is one of the world's largest telecommunications companies with annual revenue of roughly $71 billion. But unlike other foreign phone giants, including British Telecommunications P.L.C., Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, N.T.T. has maintained low visibility in the United States. **********By acquiring 12.5 percent of Teligent, N.T.T. is making a small but potentially lucrative bet that some American companies seeking integrated voice, data and video communications will choose a relatively untested wireless technology over fiber optic cable, the prevailing delivery system. **********Teligent is aiming to take customers from the regional Bell companies by offering advanced communications services directly to buildings without wires. Within three years, it hopes to offer service in 74 metropolitan markets in 34 states. **********As it has tried to establish its credibility, Teligent's greatest asset has perhaps been the strong reputation of its chairman, Alex J. Mandl, a former No. 2 executive at the AT&T Corporation. The company can now also count on technical assistance from one of Japan's leading research and development laboratories. **********''N.T.T.'s decision to invest $100 million in Teligent strengthens our effort to increase competition in local telephone markets,'' Mr. Mandl said in a statement yesterday. ''By offering high-quality, high-capacity, facilities-based communications services to small and medium-sized businesses in the United States, Teligent will help fulfill the promise of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.'' The law was meant to foster competition in local phone markets. **********Akihiko Okada, a spokesman for the United States subsidiary, NTT America Inc., commented: ''Wireless local loop providers like Teligent are very interesting and attractive for N.T.T. The headquarters is very interested in the local access opportunities.'' **********Teligent was not the only local telephone company attracting attention yesterday. The Wall Street Journal reported that Worldcom, the fourth-largest long-distance carrier, was planning to acquire Brooks Fiber Properties, a small, independent local phone company. **********Both companies refused to comment, and the shares of both ended lower in trading yesterday. Worldcom declined $1.1875, closing on the Nasdaq market at $35.375; Brooks Fiber closed at $46.6875, down 18.75 cents, also on Nasdaq. **********Teligent is a private company owned mostly by the Associated Group Inc. and a unit of Telcom Ventures, an investment fund. Those investors announced that they would put an additional $60 million into the company. **********Teligent plans to offer about 10 percent of its stock, worth about $100 million, to the public by the end of the year. That offering, along with stock options for Mr. Mandl and other executives, is expected to dilute N.T.T.'s stake in the company to roughly 10 percent. **********Teligent also plans to issue about $250 million of high-yield debt and secure bank loans of about the same amount by the end of the year. **********In 1994 N.T.T. invested $75 million in Nextel Communications, a mobile wireless company.

''There may be elements of this that are a political game, but in its broad outlines I don't think it's a game.'' **********Mr. Hun Sen's presence also added credibility. It helped defuse suspicions that the report, like earlier ones, might be part of an attempt by the Prince to gain leverage in a rivalry with his co-Prime Minister. **********If Pol Pot has indeed been captured, the event marks a step toward closure in one of the most tragic episodes of the century. From 1975 to 1979, he led a fanatic Maoist movement that turned on its own population in a bloodletting that took at least a million lives. **********And if Pol Pot, 69 and reportedly ill, was indeed put on trial, the proceedings would emphasize the long reach of justice, across the 18 years in which he has lurked in the jungles pursuing his war. **********The announcement today followed a week of self-contradictory reports from Prince Ranariddh and his aides that had been met with growing skepticism here in the absence of independent evidence. **********The Prince had reported that the Khmer Rouge leadership had split in a violent confrontation and that Pol Pot was fleeing, pursued by guerrillas who had turned against him. **********The only support for his account came from clandestine broadcasts on Khmer Rouge radio, which reported Pol Pot's capture Friday for the second time in a week. **********Although much skepticism remained, particularly among Cambodians who deeply mistrust the Khmer Rouge, most experts said today that they were leaning toward believing the announcement. **********Still, it did not appear that Pol Pot was in the custody of the Cambodian Government. He was apparently being held by Khmer Rouge soldiers who have turned against him and have been in negotiations with Prince Ranariddh. Many Khmer Rouge troops and their commanders have defected to the Government over the last year. **********The Prince said Pol Pot was in Anlong Veng, the Khmer Rouge stronghold north of Phnom Penh. **********''Eventually,'' he said, ''with the agreement of Hun Sen, maybe we will, maybe, I think, one day to bring you to see him.'' **********If Pol Pot is in the hands of other Khmer Rouge fighters in Anlong Veng, it is not clear what might happen next. Where would he be taken, how would his security be assured and what would be done with him in the many months it might take to organize an international tribunal? **********And despite their statements today, do the two Cambodian leaders really wish to see a tribunal proceed? Mr. Hun Sen is a former Khmer Rouge member, Prince Ranariddh is a former battlefield ally of the Khmer Rouge and his father, King Norodom Sihanouk, was once its figurehead leader. **********But the capture of Pol Pot would be a crucial event in Cambodian history, and events are already showing a momentum of their own. **********Mr. Hun Sen, who as recently as Friday disparaged Prince Ranariddh's reports, stood beside his rival this morning and for the first time endorsed his words. **********''I have expressed my views in the past,'' he said, ''but this morning I have been briefed by the Prince that Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan have already been arrested.'' Mr. Khieu Samphan is the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge. **********''The next step, I think,'' Mr. Hun Sen added, ''would be for Prince Ranariddh and myself to send a letter to His Excellency the Secretary General of the United Nations to bring those people to an international court of justice.'' **********Mr. Khieu Samphan's status now is unclear. For days, the Prince has been describing him as a ''hostage'' of Pol Pot in his flight through the jungle. But today the Prince said both men should face trial. **********The odd report that Pol Pot had taken hostage several of his top lieutenants after killing his former Defense Minister, Son Sen, had added to suspicions here that an elaborate charade was being played out. **********But Mr. Heder said such a scenario would be ''totally at variance'' with a pattern of behavior the Khmer Rouge have followed for decades. **********''They don't call people traitors who are not traitors,'' he said. ''They don't announce they have arrested people who are not arrested.

''Only a large-scale fertility control program will reduce the future birth rate of koalas,'' she said. **********The killing option is rejected by the South Australian state government.

It takes nearly half an hour to get each of them to the ground and into waiting burlap sacks unhurt. Though unusually gentle, koalas, when agitated, may bite and claw fiercely. **********Tim Lashmar, 19, and Scott Redden, 18, both from the island and considering forestry careers, have succeeded in nudging the male down. **********Mr. Lashmar is bitten in the thigh as he grabs the animal to tag the ear. He grins. ''Only a pinch.'' Later the animal will get a permanent ID from a microchip with a bar code embedded in the shoulder. **********Next step is the nearby trailer that a local veterinarian, Dr. Greg Johnsson, has converted for surgery. **********His nurse, Nadia Jackson, holds an anesthesia mask over the furry faces as he performs a vasectomy on the male, then a tubal ligation on the female. Each operation takes 10 to 15 minutes. When the koalas wake they are returned to their original trees. **********''I'd hate to think of how many times I've done this sort of thing on dogs and cats and rams,'' Dr. Johnsson said.

He has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and so is confined to a wheelchair and speaks via a keyboard-controlled voice synthesizer. **********''My body may be stuck in this chair,'' Professor Hawking says in the spot, ''but with the Internet my mind can go to the end of the universe.'' **********The spot with Mr. Wozniak shows him with students, talking about how modems connect personal computers, which he helped pioneer 20 years ago. **********Mr. Wozniak, who teaches children about computers near his home in Northern California, said he did the ad because he values the Internet and uses U.S. Robotics modems almost exclusively. ''When they approached me, I said, 'Hey, I happen to use their modems, I like their modems, and I want to do something nice for them,' '' he said in a recent interview. Coincidentally, Apple Computer announced on Tuesday that Mr. Wozniak would rejoin it as an adviser to the chairman. **********Both men have appeared in other advertising. Mr. Wozniak was in an ad for the Datsun 280z during the mid-1980's and on a billboard for Apple laptop computers in 1992. Mr. Hawking appeared in ads for British Telecommunications, which ran in England in 1994 and 1995, said James R. Barron, a spokesman for British Telecommunications. **********The response to the two U.S. Robotics ads has been so strong that the company will soon add a third, set to begin showing by the end of March. Hundreds of consumers have told the company that they are impressed with the ads, especially because the company was able to enlist people with the scientific authenticity of Professor Hawking and Mr. Wozniak, said Neil S. Clemmons, vice president for marketing in the personal communications division of U.S. Robotics. **********The ads highlight a new line of U.S. Robotics modems, called x2 Technology, which will enable users to connect to the Internet over standard telephone lines at speeds as high as 56 kilobits a second, nearly twice the rate of today's fastest conventional modems. Other companies are developing this type of modem, but U.S. Robotics appears poised to beat them to market. **********The entry into television advertising -- unusual for modem makers --  is an attempt to capture the growing segment of computer buyers who purchase their machines specifically to connect to the Internet. **********''Traditionally, modem manufacturers have advertised in PC magazines,'' said Eric C. Buck, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York. ''Now, the sophistication of the buyer is decreasing. So now the PC buyer is the guy who watches more TV than reads magazines.'' **********The company did not disclose the budget for this campaign. Mr. Buck, however, noted that the company had recently added substantially to its spending on sales and marketing. For fiscal 1996, U.S. Robotics spent $100.8 million on the category, more than double the amount spent the year before. **********In contrast, revenue in that period grew by about 80 percent. ''Sales and marketing expenditure is growing even faster than sales, and I think that's due to promotional increases,'' Mr. Buck said. **********The ads are running nationally, on network and cable television. They are accompanied by five print ads -- only one of which features Professor Hawking -- that are running in computer publications and popular magazines, including Time and Rolling Stone. They are also being considered for use in Britain, said Mr. Xistris of the Leap Partnership, which is part of the Leap Group, whose other clients include Ameritech and Pizza Hut."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/06/world/judge-says-canada-can-deport-suspect-in-lethal-saudi-bombing.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Depalma", "pub_date": "1997-05-06", "snippet": "Canadian judge upholds deportation order against Hani Abdel Rahim al-Sayegh, Saudi terror suspect, opening way for US to question him about bombing of American military complex near Dhahran in 1996 in which 19 airmen died; backs findings by intell...", "word_count": 594, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Judge Says Canada Can Deport Suspect in Lethal Saudi Bombing", "print_headline": "Judge Says Canada Can Deport Suspect in Lethal Saudi Bombing", "body_text": " **********A Canadian judge upheld a deportation order against a Saudi terror suspect today, opening the way for the United States to question the man about the bombing of a military residence in Saudi Arabia last year that killed 19 Americans. **********Judge Donna McGillis took less than an hour to reach a decision upholding the Canadian intelligence service's allegation that the Saudi, Hani Abdel Rahim al-Sayegh, had been involved in the terrorist attack and should be deported. **********It is now up to Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board to decide where Mr. Sayegh will be sent.

Director, Louis Freeh, said on Sunday on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.'' **********Mr. Sayegh's arrest in Ottawa in March was considered a major breakthrough in the investigation of the bombing. But doubts soon arose about the quality of the evidence against him, and whether it was strong enough to be used if he was put on trial in the United States. **********Officials in the Justice Department in Washington said today that no decision had been made on whether to ask Canada to consider deporting Mr. Sayegh to the United States. **********A criminal trial in the bombing could have serious repercussions. The Canadian intelligence service has indicated that Mr. Sayegh is a member of Saudi Hezbollah, or Party of God, which has links to Iran. Such a finding in a criminal case could create pressure for a retaliatory attack against Iran. **********But when he applied for asylum in Canada as a political refugee last August, Mr. Sayegh said he belonged to a dissident group of Saudis opposed to the current Government. The Saudi Government contends that the Dhahran bombing was not the work of domestic dissidents. **********Canadian intelligence agents assert that Mr. Sayegh, 28, signaled the driver of a truck loaded with 5,000 pounds of explosives to enter the compound in Dhahran last June 25. He is alleged to have sped off, with several others, just before the bomb was detonated, demolishing the front of the apartment building. Nineteen American airmen were killed, and more than 500 Americans and Saudis were wounded. **********Canadian officials assert that a Hezbollah cell in Canada helped bring Mr. Sayegh to Ottawa a few weeks after the bombing. A similar deportation proceeding in 1994 disclosed the existence of a terrorist network in Canada, officials say. **********Mr. Sayegh, wearing a white dress shirt, dark slacks and metal-rimmed glasses, smiled and even laughed throughout the hour he spent in court today. As he was led from the courtroom, he was asked if he wanted to say anything about his involvement in the bombing. He smiled and shook his head. **********After he was arrested in March, Mr. Sayegh told reporters that he had been in Syria on the day of the bombing. Later he said he had been in Qum, Iran, on that day, and that he had studied in Iran for several years. **********His lawyer, Douglas M. Baum of Ottawa, said Mr. Sayegh had decided not to testify today.

For some investors, however, the industry may serve up a bitter brew. **********But the executives at tiny Dalton Specialties Ltd. are not daunted by that possibility. The four-year-old company operates 10 coffee bars, most of them in New York City,  and it has increased its revenue nicely, to $2.8 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30. Indeed, Dalton wants to add as many as 43 outlets in the next two years. So late last month it began to go public to raise $3 million for expansion. **********Rather than going public in the usual way, Dalton is using a direct public offering, a process that has become increasingly popular with small companies. Forgoing an underwriter, the company is announcing the deal on posters and is offering the needed documents at its shops, on its Web site (www.daltoncoffee.com) and through a toll-free number (888 325-8669). **********Dalton hopes to sell 42 percent of the company, offering as many as 600,000 units at $5 apiece. A unit consists of 10 shares and five warrants. Each warrant is good for the purchase of one additional share for 65 cents. **********At first blush, the deal -- which carries a $500 minimum purchase -- looks tempting; after all, the coffee business is good. True, the amount of coffee being consumed per person is not growing, said Harry Balzer, a consumer researcher at the NPD Group, a company in Rosemont, Ill., that specializes in food trends. But the percentage of coffee sold at coffee bars is rising fast. In a recent survey of about 33,000 consumers, NPD found that, on average, people made 42 percent more visits to coffeehouses or coffee bars during the year that ended in February than during the year before. **********Still, can small retailers like Dalton compete against the might of, say, Starbucks, with its 1,200 coffee bars? **********''Absolutely,'' said Bruce Milletto, the president of the Bellissimo Coffee Education Group, which provides consulting services to the coffee industry and others. Smaller companies can succeed, he said, if they offer better products or service. Oddly, they can also enhance their chances by situating themselves near big enterprises' outlets -- a strategy Dalton follows. **********''What these larger companies are doing is raising industry awareness, so it's actually an advantage to be near them,'' he said. **********But these theories about small coffee enterprises are one thing. The reality of their stock performance is another. **********True, Starbucks has done well; its stock has risen sharply in the last two years, from about $12 to $33.75 at Friday's close. But many small coffee companies that have gone public recently have seen investor interest evaporate as fast as the steam from an espresso machine. Diedrich Coffee of Irvine, Calif., with about 40 coffeehouses in the West, put its stock on the market at about $10 in September; it closed on Friday at $2.875. Coffee People, with about 20 stores in its home state of Oregon, opened at $9 in September and now sells for $5.75. **********''These offerings have almost all been disasters,'' said Michael T. Moe, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''I suspect that most of these companies just weren't ready for prime time.'' **********Investors may be worried that Dalton is  similarly small and young. Equally troubling, the neighborhood charm that often helps small coffeehouses succeed -- Mr. Moe calls them ''nonalcoholic 'Cheers' '' -- may be lost as these newly public companies seek the growth they need. ''As you go past 10, 20 or 30 stores, replicating that atmosphere becomes more difficult,'' Mr. Moe said. **********Dalton's share price of 50 cents does not appear too costly. And Dalton's price-to-sales ratio, which compares a stock's price with a company's annual sales per share, is 2.0, versus 3.7 for Starbucks. But Dalton seems pricier when compared with other small companies like Diedrich, which has a 0.6 ratio, or Coffee People, at 0.8. **********Moreover, Dalton has yet to turn a profit, partly because it has plowed money into new stores. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, it lost $164,000. The offering is small, too. Its 6 million shares, which pale next to Starbucks's 78 million shares outstanding, may be illiquid, or difficult to trade. **********WHAT about the warrants? These devices, essentially options, help small companies to keep up interest in a stock down the road, said David Menlow, president of IPO Financial Network in Springfield, N.J. But for investors, they amplify risk. **********If Dalton stock does not rise past 65 cents, for example, the warrants that investors bought will be worthless. And if the stock does rise past that sum and investors consequently exercise many warrants, the stock's value will be diluted by the increase in shares. The bottom line? With warrants, a stock may need to appreciate substantially to make it profitable for investors. **********A decline in Dalton stock is not far-fetched. Since 1993, Dalton has had a stock issue on the Vancouver Stock Exchange. And while those shares came close to $2 (Canadian), or $1.54 (United States), in mid-1994, they soon fell. For the last two and a half years they have generally traded between 20 cents and 50 cents (Canadian), closing on Friday at 43 cents. **********Kevin Dalton, a company co-founder, said he was aware of the downside of warrants for investors, as well as the problems that coffee company stocks have had. But such difficulties are ''a risk that all new companies take'' when they go public, he said. He also believes that the best that Dalton can do for itself and for investors is to compete well. **********''Obviously, we're hoping to run the company as best we can,'' he said. ''We plan on being careful in picking our sites, and in maintaining high-quality product and service.'' **********Regardless of whether Dalton succeeds, it faces another problem: the way it went public. Mr. Dalton said he did not want to make  a direct public offering; in fact, he said, he spent a year trying to get Wall Street firms to do the job. But he had no luck. **********''We were too small,'' he said. **********So Dalton took the do-it-yourself route. **********Sales have been ''modest'' since the stock went on sale April 23, Mr. Dalton said. But so far the company has registered its stock only in New York, although it is now seeking additional approvals in California, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania so that investors there can purchase the securities. **********According to Tom Stewart-Gordon, publisher of SCOR Report, a Dallas newsletter on small corporate offering registrations, direct offerings have grown substantially in recent years. In 1996, 190 companies used the method, versus 145 in 1995. By issuing stock directly, companies avoid underwriter fees, and can advertise the deal on, say,  their six-packs (Spring Street Brewing) or macaroni boxes (Annie's Homegrown). **********But while, according to Mr. Stewart-Gordon, the quality of direct offerings is improving, they also raise investor risk. **********Because the issues lack underwriters, for example, no investment bankers are checking the company's references and no analysts or brokers are researching or recommending the stocks. Thus, investors can obtain little independent information. And the typically few shares that are issued can become even more illiquid because many directly offered stocks, including Dalton's, trade on no exchange. They trade on ad hoc markets. **********Dalton, for example, plans to seek a broker to match buyers and sellers or, failing that, to set up an in-house service. Investors can call Dalton's toll-free number for developments. (Don't expect the stock to have a ticker symbol, however it may eventually trade. Because there is no exchange, there is no ticker.) **********But before deciding whether to buy in, separate your taste for gourmet coffee from the needs of your purse. ''With these investments,'' Mr. Menlow said, ''investors are asked to take on an inordinate level of risk.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/01/business/debt-issues-fuel-gain-in-underwriting.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Bagli", "pub_date": "1997-04-01", "snippet": "Securities Data Co says stock and bond underwriting rose 12 percent in first three months of 1997, even as rising interest rates indicated potential slowdown in sales over coming year; first-quarter surge was fueled by sale of bonds and other debt...", "word_count": 779, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Debt Issues Fuel Gain in Underwriting", "print_headline": "Debt Issues Fuel Gain in Underwriting", "body_text": " **********Stock and bond underwriting rose 12 percent in the first three months of 1997, even as rising interest rates indicate a potential slowdown in sales over the coming year. **********The first-quarter surge was fueled by the sale of bonds and other debt, which rose to $239.3 billion in the first quarter, compared with $214.6 billion in the similar period of 1996. **********But higher interest rates, a weakness in technology stocks and investor trepidation about corporate earnings growth dampened underwriting volume in other areas. Sales of common stock in the United States declined 7 percent, to $21.3 billion, according to the Securities Data Company. The most drastic drop in equity issues came in the underwriting volume for initial public offerings, which fell nearly 30 percent, to $5.9 billion, from $8.6 billion in the first three months of 1996. **********''The recent volatility in the marketplace and the rise in interest rates has begun to affect the new issue market,'' Brian Hehir, co-chief of global equity markets at Merrill Lynch & Company, said. ''It had its most impact on the I.P.O. volume, which is down. And the new-issue backlog is only about $13 billion at a time when we should be approaching our seasonal peak.'' **********In the first quarter, the securities industry underwrote $273.3 billion worth of domestic debt and equity issues, up from $245 billion in the comparable period last year, according to Securities Data. **********Merrill Lynch remained the top debt and equity underwriter over all, a position it has held since 1988. Merrill underwrote 312 deals worth more than $44 billion. Goldman, Sachs & Company came in second, followed by Salomon Brothers, J. P. Morgan & Company and Lehman Brothers. The five firms collectively accounted for nearly 60 percent of all underwriting fees. **********The total disclosed fees collected by all underwriting firms fell by 9.8 percent in the first quarter to $1.8 billion, according to Securities Data. At Morgan Stanley Group Inc., underwriting fees fell almost 42 percent in the first quarter to $132.6 million. But Merrill; Goldman; Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., a unit  of the Equitable Companies; Lehman Brothers and J. P. Morgan reported higher income for the three-month period, indicating that the largest firms, with the most access to global markets, are tightening their grip on underwriting and are able to offset declines in the United States with activity in Europe, Asia or Latin America. **********Interest rates rose in the last month as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve's decision last week to increase the overnight lending rate in an effort to stem inflation. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, a benchmark for setting prices on other debt, climbed above 7 percent for the first time since September. The 4 percent drop in the Nasdaq composite index in the last month only increased the uneasiness among investors. **********''We've seen a weakness in the secondary markets in telecommunications and technology areas, traditionally a big part of the markets,'' said Marc L. Paley, the managing director at Lehman Brothers who is in charge of equity syndications. ''To the degree that the secondary market is volatile, it'll hurt the new issue market in a major way.'' **********But interest rates are not yet so high as to discourage companies like Raytheon and Norfolk Southern and other companies engaged in strategic acquisitions from entering the bond markets, said John Massad, a partner at J. P. Morgan in charge of debt syndication. Certainly the cash is there. Attracted by the higher interest rates, insurance companies, pension funds and mutual funds continue to funnel money into bonds. **********''The rise in interest rates has been relatively modest, and relative to historic levels, interest rates are still at attractive levels,'' Mr. Massad said. ''So companies are still issuing debt. The volume may be off as much as 20 percent in the coming quarter, but we don't expect a dramatic decline. These rates are still attractive to issuers.'' **********But rising interest rates may affect the junk bond market, which saw a 20.6 percent jump in offerings in the first quarter. Donaldson, Lufkin, the leading firm in the field, underwrote the largest high-yield bond so far of the 1990's, the $2 billion sale of debt by Tenet Healthcare. **********''This was a very attractive time to issue long-term capital,'' said Bennett Goodman, who heads the high-yield bond department at Donaldson. ''Interest rates were very low, and the typical high-yield bond had a 9.5 precent coupon, while Treasuries were yielding 6.5 percent.'' **********But with interest rates rising on high-yield bonds, corporations may opt to go elsewhere for money. ''High yield bonds may not be as attractive as bank debt or selling equity related security,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''Right now there's a very hot bank-debt market, and that'll begin to cannibalize the high-yield market.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/17/world/a-fallen-city-seeking-peace-greets-rebels.html": {"writer_name": "James McKinley", "pub_date": "1997-03-17", "snippet": "Thousands of Zairians in Kisangani wear white headbands in show of solidarity with rebel soldiers who captured city, possibly dealing fatal blow to tottering Government of Pres Mobutu Sese Seko; are walking streets freely for first time in weeks, ...", "word_count": 1197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Fallen City, Seeking Peace, Greets Rebels", "print_headline": "A Fallen City, Seeking Peace, Greets Rebels", "body_text": " **********Thousands of people wore white headbands today to show solidarity with the rebel soldiers who marched victoriously into this sweltering river town on Saturday, dealing what many consider a fatal blow to the tottering Government of President Mobutu Sese Seko. **********The white headband ''stands for peace,'' said one man. ''The people are very happy because finally it is calm here.'' **********A day after rebels captured the city, Kisangani's beleaguered residents were walking the streets freely for the first time in weeks, celebrating the departure of Government troops and Serbian mercenaries who during months of occupation had robbed and mistreated them, summarily executing some for minor infractions. **********''We are liberated,'' said Albert Nyembo, a university student, who is 22. ''They are not rebels,'' he added. ''They are liberators.'' **********Residents said that despite weeks of preparation, Government troops put up almost no resistance, and that some had begun to flee even before the rebels arrived at the outskirts of town at about 2 P.M. Saturday after taking Bangoka International Airport, about 12 miles to the east. **********The final push started on Friday night, when the rebel column neared the airport and started battling the mercenaries defending its perimeter. **********In Kisangani, residents said, the Government troops rioted and looted all night long, throwing grenades into shops, stealing cars and firing into the air. **********Witnesses told of chaotic scenes on Saturday morning as Government soldiers scrambled to get their families and belongings onto boats and across the river to the west bank. The soldiers left hauling mattresses, television sets, radios, pots and pans, anything they could carry. **********''They were shooting in the air the whole time,'' said Pele Lesondja, a 32-year-old hotel manager. ''They were stealing taxis and minibuses. They also took all the ferry boats and canoes and fled to the other bank.'' **********Rebel officials said that most of the retreating soldiers headed southwest toward the town of Opala, but that thousands of others scattered into the jungle. About 260 Government soldiers straggled back to the city today and surrendered to rebel commanders. **********The dismal performance by the Government troops was a humiliating defeat for Mr. Mobutu. Kisangani was the headquarters for the Government's heralded counteroffensive, and it was supposed to be heavily defended by several elite battalions as well as a company of about 300 Serbian mercenaries. **********The mercenaries had fortified and mined the perimeter of the airport, which they used as their headquarters. The airport had been the last major runway still in Government hands in the eastern half of the country. **********Now that it is under rebel control, the Government cannot mount a counteroffensive or resupply its soldiers in the region, where the roads are often impassible. **********Joseph Kabila, the rebel commander in charge of the assault on the city, said today that the only real resistance his troops had faced came 34 miles northeast of Kisangani. **********Commander Kabila, the 25-year-old son of the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, said the rebels fought for four days along that road, beginning Tuesday morning. He said the Government troops had used heavy guns, tanks and mortars to stop the rebel advance. For three days, both sides exchanged artillery fire without either making progress. **********Then on Friday morning, Commander Kabila said, the rebels were able to outflank and break through the Government line. Government troops scattered in the bush, he said, and the Serbian mercenaries, many of whom were handling the big guns, retreated about 22 miles to Bangoka Airport and dug in. **********When the rebel column arrived at the airport Friday afternoon, the mercenaries began shelling them and the rebels returned the fire. By 7 P.M., the mercenaries started pulling out, evacuating several hundred Government troops on cargo planes, Mr. Kabila said. As they retreated, they blew up their artillery pieces and an ammunition dump. **********The rebel commander denied reports that some Government units, including the 31st Paratroop Brigade, had switched sides and helped defeat the mercenaries holding the airport. He also denied reports that Angolan troops had joined the rebels. **********He said most of the resistance came from the Serbs and from former Rwandan Hutu soldiers, who came to Zaire as refugees in 1994. The Zairian Government soldiers, he said, did not appear to have the stomach for a battle. **********''They don't have the brains to fight the war and they are not dedicated,'' Commander Kabila said. ''They don't have a reason to fight. We have a reason to fight. That's what kept us going all this time.'' **********The fall of the city was the biggest blow to the Government since the rebels took up arms in October. In sixth months, they have seized more than a sixth of Zaire. **********The rebels accuse Mr. Mobutu of driving what should be a rich nation into poverty by enriching himself and his political allies and neglecting public works. **********But their cause cannot be separated from the ethnic conflict between Tutsi and Hutu in neighboring Rwanda. The core of the rebel fighters are Zairian Tutsi, many of whom fought in the Rwandan civil war in 1994. **********They started the revolt after the Government in South Kivu Province tried to strip them of citizenship and deport them to Rwanda in September. **********Some of these Zairian Tutsi rebels are also seeking revenge against Hutu refugees who fled Rwanda in 1994, after a Rwandan Tutsi rebel army came to power. That army halted the mass killings of Tutsi by Rwanda's previous Government, led by Hutu. **********Among the 100,000 refugees still lost in Zaire are thousands of former Hutu soldiers, Government officials and militia members who took part in the massacres. In recent months, they have been rearmed and fighting for the Zairian Government. **********About 70,000 of these people have arrived at Ubundu, a town 80 miles south of Kisangani on the Congo River. The refugees -- hungry and exhausted -- are camped on the east bank. Some have drowned trying to cross the swift, crocodile-infested waters to the west. **********It remains unclear what the rebel commanders will do about the refugees now that they control Kisangani. Laurent Kabila, the rebel leader,  has said repeatedly that the refugees are free to march home. But there have been persistent reports of Tutsi rebels killing Hutu refugees, in revenge for the mass killings in Rwanda. **********For most of the people in Kisangani, the rebel victory was a godsend. Thousands went out to meet the first rebel soldiers who trooped into the town on Saturday. Many mobbed the soldiers, embracing and cheering them on their way into the city center, witnesses said. **********''They were jubilant,'' the younger Mr. Kabila said. ''To say they were excited is an understatement.'' **********Both the Zairian soldiers and the mercenaries have earned a reputation for brutality. Several residents said one of the Serbian commanders, who went by the name Colonel Yugo,  established a petty reign of terror in the last two weeks. **********Claiming to have authority from President Mobutu, the Serbian colonel summarily executed several people who were arrested for not carrying their identity cards, witnesses said. **********Damien Fikirini, a 32-year-old unemployed man who walked the streets after dark for the first time in months, said he supported Mr. Kabila for one reason: the rebels had brought peace and security to Kisangani. **********''The movement will grow,'' he said.

Such bonds are typically free from Federal income tax. But when you live in the issuing state, the interest is usually free from state and local income taxes, too. Generally, this is not so with out-of-state bonds: If you live in, say, California and own New York municipal bonds, you will pay California tax on the bond income. **********But that does not mean you should necessarily sell or swap your New York bonds for Florida ones. To decide, do the math. **********Specifically, you must determine if the yield on the New York munis, minus the taxes you must pay Florida on those out-of-state bonds, will be greater than the yield you would get on Florida municipal bonds. The calculation demands a close look at yields, tax rates and commissions. **********For the most part, the current interest-rate climate dictates bond yields. Variations tend to reflect the differences in bond quality -- their credit ratings, maturities, call provisions and so on. But you may still want to comparison-shop because, just like the highway speed limit, bond yields can vary slightly from state to state. This is a result of the supply of and demand for the bonds. **********Florida may be as renowned for its freedom from an individual income tax as it is for Key lime pie. But the Florida life is not all sweet when it comes to investment income. The state levies a tax on intangible personal property, like cash, stocks and most bonds (but not Florida munis). **********The intangibles tax sets a rate of  $2 for every $1,000 worth of investments, as measured by their fair market value. However, the first $20,000 ($40,000 for joint filers) of  your bonds is exempt from all tax.  The next $80,000 ($160,000 for joint filers) is subject to an assessment of only $1 per $1,000. Only for investments in excess of $100,000 ($200,000  for joint filers) would you pay the full $2 per $1,000. **********In other words, unless you are a mogul or a movie star, ''you may discover that in the case of Florida, the tax is quite minimal'' on out-of-state munis, said Marybeth Whyte, a director at Salomon Brothers Asset Management. For instance, for a single person, the tax on the market value of $80,000 of bonds would be only $60 and the tax on $100,000 worth would be $80 -- about the price of a day at Disney World. **********But commissions must also be considered. At a typical 1 percent commission, it would cost $2,000 to sell $100,000 in muni bonds and then to buy new ones. And if your New York bonds have appreciated, you may also have to pay tax on the gains. **********The commission seems hefty compared with the $80 tax. But before deciding to stay with your New York bonds, remember that you will pay the commission only once. The intangibles tax will be due every year. If  your New York bonds have 30 years to maturity, for example, your intangibles payments will total $2,400. **********After you have crunched the numbers, you can decide whether to hold your old bonds or to buy new ones. But there are other considerations. **********If you opt to swap, for example, you may want to buy Florida bonds with a longer duration than the ones you are selling. By extending the maturity, you can normally receive a higher yield and make up some of the outlay for the commission and any taxes due on the gains. However, during that longer time there is a greater risk of rising interest rates, in which case the value of your bonds would fall. That doesn't matter, of course, if you hold them to maturity. **********You may also want to check with a Florida broker. ''A local broker may have better access to the Florida muni market,'' said Robert Zipf, author of ''How the Bond Market Works'' (Prentice-Hall, $17.95). **********Another factoid: The Florida intangibles tax is figured on your investments as of one day only, Dec. 31.  It doesn't matter what you own during the rest of the year. Think of it as the Sunshine State's own little way of saying ''Happy New Year.'' **********Despite all the fine points, there are general rules for munis and moving. For example, if you are going to a high-tax state, like Massachusetts or New Jersey, a bond swap is more likely to be in your interest than if you go to a lower-tax state. **********Also, watch your tax bracket. If you are retiring as well as moving,  you may no longer be in a bracket high enough to make munis worthwhile. The best course, then -- assuming you want to keep holding bonds -- is to sell your munis in favor of Treasuries, which are federally taxable although exempt from state and local taxes, or corporate bonds, which are taxed at all levels. **********Nevertheless, many people who own muni bonds are in too low a bracket for the bonds to make sense,  Mr. Zipf said. So why do they own them? Three reasons, he said. Some investors just prefer not having to set aside a portion of their interest checks for taxes. Others may have fallen into a lower tax bracket --  through a job change, retirement or a business loss -- since the original purchase was made. And some buyers simply do not realize that they could be getting a better return from a taxable bond. **********But if muni bonds are right for you,  pack a calculator with the sunscreen when you head to Florida. Don't expect to avoid the hard work even on  the ''miracle flight'' -- the name a flight attendant friend of mine has given her New York-Florida route. About 20 wheelchairs are requested for the flight's pre-boarding , but, oddly, not for disembarking. Moments after landing in Fort Lauderdale, most of the former invalids are seen striding briskly into the sunshine.

But the petition was broadly worded, asking the board to affirm Toyota's position that it is not in the public interest to allow anyone to acquire a lot of dealerships quickly. **********In addition to the Houston dealership, Republic bought a Toyota dealership in Miami at the beginning of this year and announced another deal on Monday to buy a Toyota dealership in Tempe, Ariz. James E. Press, a senior vice president for sales at Toyota, said that Republic had notified Toyota of plans to acquire 59 of its dealerships over the next 18 months, accounting for 20 percent of Toyota's nationwide sales. **********Mr. Press said that Republic had not yet proved that it could run even a few dealerships, much less dozens, with the quality of customer service and repair work that Toyota requires. ''They're not operating a dealership that we know of for more than four or five months,'' Mr. Press said in a telephone interview. ''Isn't it reasonable that we would want to slow things down and see how things work before we turn over 20 percent of our volume?'' **********Republic, which has already become the nation's largest automotive retailer, was quick to criticize Toyota's move. ''We think the action is without merit,'' said J. Ronald Castell, Republic's senior vice president for marketing and communications. Republic has already completed without difficulty the acquisition of a dealership in Midland, Tex., that sells Chevrolet, Buick and Mazda cars, said Mr. Castell, who declined to comment on Toyota's specific concerns. **********Toyota has a policy of trying to prevent any person or company from acquiring more than one dealership every nine months. Toyota has also maintained a policy until now of barring any person or company from owning more than seven Toyota dealerships and three Lexus dealerships. **********Franchise agreements with car dealers give auto makers the authority to veto the transfer of franchises to anybody the auto makers deem unsuitable. But state laws put many limits on the auto makers' ability to exercise this veto, so most dealership transfers are routinely approved. State regulatory agencies like the Texas Motor Vehicle Board administer these laws. **********Auto industry officials expressed surprise that Toyota had chosen to make its stand in Texas, where the vehicle board has a reputation for siding with dealers against auto makers. Because Republic bought its second dealership in Texas less than three months after its first purchase, Mr. Press said, Toyota had to take action there. **********''We're playing the hand that has been dealt to us,'' he said. **********According to Automotive News, an industry publication, Republic reached agreements through March 20 to acquire 73 dealerships with $4.7 billion in combined 1996 sales. **********Republic has already concluded broad dealership acquisition agreements with the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company and less formal arrangements with other auto makers, although not with Toyota. The agreements provide a legal framework for the auto makers to approve each acquisition quickly as they come along. **********In exchange, auto executives say, Republic has promised at least some of the auto makers that it will continue to participate in regional advertising purchases with smaller, independent dealers. That limits Republic's ability to use its greater sales volume to demand better rates for advertising than its competitors can negotiate. **********In a filing a month ago with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Republic also disclosed that it had agreed to sell its G.M. and Ford dealerships back to the manufacturers if a change of control occurred at Republic that either manufacturer viewed as unacceptable. **********Chrysler officials have already said they will not allow any individual or company to buy more than 10 of their dealerships nationwide, more than 6 in any of the company's 25 sales regions or more than 2 in any market. Other auto makers have not disclosed any limits on the acquisition of dealerships but are widely thought to have them. **********G.M. and Ford have been particularly receptive to Republic because they want to reduce the number of their dealerships. Ford has close to 90 dealerships in the Los Angeles area alone, and they tend to compete with one another instead of going after Japanese rivals. Toyota has no need or desire to reduce the number of its dealerships, Mr. Press said. **********H. Wayne Huizenga, Republic's chairman, said in an interview last month at the company's headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that Republic would be able to find economies of scale from running many dealerships. **********But consumer advocates are beginning to worry about the consolidation of automotive retailing. ''Consumers may end up with higher prices and fewer model choices if a significant segment of the market is controlled by Republic or any other group,'' said Mary Ponder, a senior projects director at the Consumer Federation of America. **********Republic has been buying large dealerships with good reputations for customer service. While some big dealers have welcomed Republic's acquisitions as a chance to sell their operations for a handsome price, many smaller dealers have been worried that Republic will monopolize some markets and drive them out of business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/27/business/high-tech-push-to-make-small-more-beautiful.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1997-01-27", "snippet": "Little-known but promising technology called micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) uses tiny sensors, motors, valves and other devices embedded on computer chips to sense heat, light, motion and sound and take appropriate action; applications ra...", "word_count": 1496, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "High-Tech Push To Make Small More Beautiful", "print_headline": "High-Tech Push To Make Small More Beautiful", "body_text": " **********At the Xerox Corporation's research center here is a remarkable model, a miniature structure covered with a wired web of sensors that look like small baby-bottle nipples.

But nimble buildings are just one possibility that researchers envision for a little-known but promising technology called micro-electro-mechanical systems. **********These Lilliputian sensors, motors, nozzles, valves or other mechanical systems will be able to sense heat, light, motion and sound. Placed on the surface of computer chips, these tiny devices will also be smart enough to interpret what it all means and take action. **********Some of the more intriguing applications now in the lab include an airplane wing that can maneuver without the aid of either ailerons or rudders. Instead, the skin of the wing has a ''peach fuzz'' of two-tenth-millimeter sensors. Controlled by computers, these minuscule flaps can monitor the air sweeping across a wing in flight and respond in concert to stabilize or even turn an aircraft. **********Other futuristic applications include substitutes for paint that fill in cracks or release a fire retardant when exposed to heat; automobile bumpers that repair themselves, and sensors embedded in a cellular telephone that could pinpoint the user's location. **********Increasingly sophisticated micro-electro-mechanical systems, known as MEMS, may soon be making their way into so many elements of everyday life that many scientists and engineers believe they could eventually have an effect as profound as that of the microchip. **********''The 1980's were defined by the microprocessor, and cheap lasers have made possible the communications advances of the 1990's,'' said Paul Saffo, a computer industry consultant at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. ''The first decade of the next century is going to be shaped by MEMS.'' **********Micro-electro-mechanical systems are already much more than a futuristic vision. An estimated $2.2 billion worth of these devices are sold annually for use in products like automobile air bags and home blood-pressure kits. And a market is seen emerging for inexpensive chemical analysis instruments -- the equivalent of a laboratory on a chip. **********Especially in the aftermath of disclosures that troops during the Persian Gulf war were exposed to toxic residue from destroyed Iraqi munitions dumps, the Pentagon is eager to have inexpensive, portable means for detecting chemical and biological weapons. With MEMS, researchers hope to replace cumbersome $17,000 laboratory spectrometers -- instruments that measure light waves to determine the chemical composition of substances -- with $20 devices that could easily be carried by foot soldiers. **********Typically, the goal with MEMS is either to replace existing devices with cheaper, more efficient technology, or to develop entirely new capabilities that were once simply beyond the reach of earlier electro-mechanical technologies. **********In less than a year on the market, for example, a $7 MEMS sensor from a company called Analog Devices has become the leading motion detector used in automobile air bags. The sensor, which instructs the air bag to inflate, consists primarily of a microscopic whisker of silicon that  can detect a car's sudden deceleration when it hits an object. The Analog Devices sensor is not only less than half the price of earlier mechanical sensors, but industry engineers say it is much more reliable. **********And a new type of projection-television system, with much brighter, sharper pictures than previously available, has a MEMS-based video-display system developed by Texas Instruments. The projector is powered by an array of millions of microscopic controllable mirrors floating on a single silicon chip called a digital light processor. Projection systems that are based on the technology, used primarily for business conferences in auditoriums and other large-audience settings, are now being sold by manufacturers, including Electrohome, In Focus Systems, Nview and Proxima. **********Despite the recent rush toward MEMS in laboratories in the United States, Asia and Europe, the underlying ideas were conceived nearly four decades ago. **********One early proponent of micro-miniaturization was Richard Feynman, a professor at the California Institute of Technology who would later win a Nobel Prize for his work in quantum physics. In a now-famous 1959 lecture at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society, Dr. Feynman urged engineers to pursue ultra-small technology for manipulating and controlling things and processes, speculating that tiny computers would one day be able to store the contents of the Encyclopaedia Britannica on the head of a pin. (An angels' dance that is now within the realm of the feasible.) **********Today, dozens of small American start-up companies are on the brink of bringing new MEMS applications to market. In Silicon Valley, for example, a company called Cepheid is developing micro-instruments for biomedical testing, including a fluid-testing chip that will combine valves, sensors and channels all on a single sliver of silicon. Intended to test blood and urine for a variety of medical conditions with high accuracy at low cost, the device is expected to reach the market within a year. **********Another company, Redwood Microsystems, is building pressure-flow regulators and micro-valves that make laparoscopic surgery and other medical and industrial applications more precise and less expensive. Silicon Light Machines is working on an alternative approach to Texas Instruments' digital light processor, using tiny gratings that act as electronic prisms to diffract light, rather than reflect it, producing full-color images from a single beam. And a start-up called Telenekron is working on a new class of chemical sensors for various uses in gas meters and automobiles. **********One reason MEMS researchers are so confident about progress is that the technology draws on many of the powerful manufacturing techniques already well proved by the semiconductor industry -- techniques that can churn out millions of copies of even the most complex designs at remarkably low cost. **********In creating a microscopic MEMS pressure sensor, for example, engineers employ the same kinds of masks and etching compounds used in the production of silicon chips. By etching away most of the surface material they are able to create a diaphanous diaphragm as thin as a single micron. (A human hair is at least 75 microns thick.) Pressure from these sensitive diaphragms can be read by a thin layer of electrical resistors embedded into the surface, whose voltage fluctuates with the diaphragm's subtlest movement. **********To be sure, big challenges remain for MEMS researchers. Placing millions of individual components on a tiny microchip is only the beginning. Making these arrays work in concert is a matter taxing even the expertise of researchers adept at a field known as massively parallel computing. **********MEMS developers, led by Andrew Berlin, a scientist at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, face just such a task in trying to figure out how those future highway-support columns would coordinate the small electronic pulses from the millions of MEMS sensors coating the column's surface. The pulses would be used to damp the vibrations from an earthquake, but no known computer would be fast enough to control such a multitude of sensors. **********By programming the individual sensors to interact only with their neighbors, however, it may be possible to break down the computing problem to a manageable size. Already, the Xerox team has used this approach in the laboratory to increase more than fivefold the strength of a model column for brief periods. **********Whatever the technical obstacles,  the new frontier of MEMS could also bring with it thorny social problems. For example, a 1995 study group in the United States, sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Pentagon, proposed the idea of ''surveillance dust.'' Each dust particle would consist of tiny sensors with a miniature parachute, microphone and infrared detector. Sprinkled over a battlefield, this dust would float for five hours or more to give pinpoint information on enemy locations. Privacy experts, however, worry that such technology could soon be widely deployed for civilian as well as military applications. **********But such concerns seem unlikely to slow the MEMS forward thrust. Despite some still-formidable technology hurdles, industry pioneers are now confident that they will be able to replicate the prodigious feats of the microelectronic world -- in the new micro-mechanical realm. **********The optimists include Gordon Moore, chairman emeritus of the chip maker Intel, who helped turn the transistors of the 1950's and 1960's into the semiconductor chips of the 70's, 80's and 90's. **********''It took a long time for the transistor to have an impact,'' he noted. ''MEMS is a really intriguing technology, and I believe it will have a significant impact in the next century.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/15/business/people.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-07-15", "snippet": "A&E Television Networks names Lyle Schwartz vice president for research (S)", "word_count": 244, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "People", "body_text": " *********** Lyle Schwartz, senior vice president and group supervisor at Young & Rubicam Advertising, New York, left to join A&E Television Networks, New York, as vice president for research, succeeding Gary Loeffler, who left to join MTV Networks, New York, a unit of Viacom Inc., as vice president for audience research.

But it smacks a lot of enviro-politics. **********The issue involves burned-out fluorescent light bulbs, which since 1990 have been designated as hazardous waste because they contain mercury that can contaminate ground water. Now, though, the Environmental Protection Agency is considering whether to take fluorescent bulbs off its most-hazardous list so they can be sent to regular landfills. **********Two of the leading fluorescent bulb makers -- the General Electric Company and Osram Sylvania Inc., a unit of Germany's Osram G.m.b.H. -- support such a move by the E.P.A. But Philips, which is a subsidiary of Philips Electronics N.V. of the Netherlands, is the industry's lone voice of opposition. **********Why? Market motives. **********Two years ago Philips's Alto fluorescent lamp, for now the lowest-mercury bulb available, became the first fluorescent lamp to pass the T-Clip test -- the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure test that the E.P.A. uses to see whether mercury can leach out of a spent bulb. **********As a result, while users of other bulbs have to hire licensed hazardous waste haulers to dispose of them in registered hazardous waste dumps, at a cost of as much as $1 a bulb, users of Alto bulbs can simply throw them away. **********Given that American industry tosses out some 550 million fluorescent bulbs each year, Philips currently has a marketing edge that the company does not want to lose. So, sensing that the E.P.A. and Congress are veering toward its competitors' court, Philips is staging a media event. **********At noon today, the company will hold a news conference in Washington to announce that it will share its Alto technology with its competitors. Several environmentalists have promised to share the podium, as has Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia -- the state where Philips makes most of its Alto bulbs. **********Giving technology away might seem a strange way to maintain a competitive edge -- even if, as Philips contends, it would take competitors at least three years and tens of millions of dollars to catch up. But, in fact, Philips and General Electric have a cross-licensing agreement that gives G.E. access to most of Philip's technology anyway. And Osram Sylvania has started to market its own low-mercury bulb, which the company believes could also pass the exhaustive T-Clip testing process. **********So what is Philips up to? **********Apparently, it hopes that the gimmick of seeming to give away its technology will pique enough public interest to put a spotlight on the whole disposal issue. That could make members of Congress reluctant to prod the E.P.A. to ease its restrictions, lest they appear to be anti-environmental. And, if it also happens to give free publicity to Alto bulbs, so much the better, from Philips's standpoint. **********''We're hoping a news conference will give broader awareness to the product itself,'' Steven M. Goldmacher, a Philips spokesman, said. **********In fact, the amount of mercury in fluorescent bulbs has been steadily dropping. In the last dozen years, the average amount of mercury in a four-foot fluorescent lamp has plunged to 22.8 milligrams from 48.2 milligrams.

Long-distance rates for all customers will decline by 5 percent to 15 percent, under a related agreement between the commission and the AT&T Corporation, the nation's dominant long-distance provider. **********The commission's chairman, Reed E. Hundt, said in an interview yesterday that the new rules would deregulate the industry even as they promoted a cherished goal of the Clinton Administration: connecting the nation's schools and libraries to the Internet. **********''What we did today is to realize the impossible dream of connecting every single American to the information highway, while figuring out how to pay for it,'' a jubilant Mr. Hundt said. **********But some lawmakers and industry experts said that the F.C.C., in trying to appease all potential opponents of the plan, had fallen short of its stated mission: to strip decades of subsidies from the nation's telephone industry and move it closer to a free-market model. **********''The commission is doing less, and postponing it longer, than people ever expected,'' said Scott Cleland, an analyst with Schwab Washington Research Group, an investment advisory firm. **********Mr. Cleland said the commission had tackled only a fraction of the $23 billion in subsidies that undergird the telephone industry. And the commission deferred until next year the thorny question of how to provide affordable phone service to rural areas, which are expensive to serve. **********Still, yesterday's rules were a historic step in unraveling six decades of Government regulation. And they elicited a generally approving response from consumer advocates and industry leaders. **********''Our great fear was that as you opened telephone markets, there would be a big rate increase,'' said Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of Consumers Union, a lobbying group in Washington. ''This sends the right message that we want to put downward pressure on rates.'' **********Robert E. Allen, the chief executive of AT&T, said in a statement, ''The F.C.C. has crafted a good compromise that will result in tangible benefits for American consumers.'' **********These are some of the main components of the F.C.C.'s plan: ***********It will sharply cut the charges that long-distance carriers pay to local phone companies for access to their customers by $1.7 billion in 1997 and $18.5 billion over five years. Access charges are set artificially high so that local phone companies can charge less for residential phone service than it costs them to provide it. ***********It will establish a relatively small Universal Service Fund of $4.65 billion. The proceeds will go to equip schools and libraries with high-speed connections to the Internet, to provide rural health care centers with phone service and to continue to serve rural customers while the F.C.C. devises a new system of rural subsidies. ***********It will impose an additional fixed charge of $1.50 a month on second residential phone lines, and an extra $3 fixed charge on business lines to help the local companies recoup the lost access revenue. ***********It will allow the local companies to charge long-distance carriers a flat monthly fee of $2.75 a line for every business customer. Analysts expect the long-distance carriers to pass along that charge in the form of higher long-distance bills. **********The MCI Communications Corporation and other long-distance carriers had argued that the F.C.C. ought to slash access charges by $10 billion in one fell swoop. The regional Bell companies warned that doing so would force them to raise rates for local service. **********In the end, Mr. Hundt sided more with the Bells -- reducing the charges by only $1.7 billion in the first year. He said that a more Draconian cut was unnecessary because access charges would fall naturally as new rivals invaded the markets of the local companies. **********Even the more modest cuts in access charges did not mollify some companies. GTE and BellSouth both harshly criticized the rules, saying that they would lead to higher local rates. **********For now though, the F.C.C. seems to have heeded the call of several senators from rural states who publicly warned Mr. Hundt in Congressional hearings not to raise local rates. **********Mr. Hundt even got a bonus over the weekend when AT&T signed an agreement with the F.C.C. to pass along all the savings it derived from lower access charges to customers in the form of lower long-distance rates. Based on AT&T's market share, that would amount to $900 million -- or a 5 percent decline in daytime and evening rates and a 15 percent decline in night and weekend rates. **********Yesterday, people familiar with MCI said it, too, would pass along savings of $340 million; Sprint is also expected to follow suit. **********Despite the F.C.C.'s delicate balancing act, there were clear winners and losers in the rules. Residential customers with one phone line will see no upward spike in their monthly local bill and may even pay less over all, since their long-distance rates will drop. **********But people who order a second line will pay an extra $1.50 a month charge, in addition to the $3.50 charge for each line that all customers now pay. Some Internet service providers complained that this could dampen use of the Internet, since many people use second lines for on-line connections. **********Stephen M. Case, the chairman of America Online Inc., said he was worried that a few consumers would drop his service. But he said he was relieved that the F.C.C. ignored the requests of the Bell companies to impose a whole new set of access charges on Internet service providers. **********Businesses with multiple lines will also have to pay more: $3 a month for each line over the $6 a line they already pay. In addition, they are likely to absorb the $2.75 in flat fees that long-distance carriers will be charged by local companies for every business line. **********The decision to load the new costs on businesses provoked a storm of protest from lobbyists for business customers. A day before the rules were issued, Mr. Hundt capitulated to their request to lower the flat fee to $2.75 a line from $4.50 a line. **********''Businesses are going to continue to underwrite too many costs, but I praise the F.C.C. for taking out the worst of anti-business regulations,'' said Brian Moir, a Washington lawyer who represents the International Communications Association, a trade group for business customers. **********Clearly, the sweetest moment for Mr. Hundt came yesterday afternoon at the National Geographic Society in Washington, where he and Vice President Al Gore celebrated the schools and libraries initiative with a coalition of educators and librarians. **********Yet some experts said it was precisely the extra money for schools and libraries that would make the F.C.C.'s rules difficult to sustain over the long haul. In effect, the Government is adding new costs at the same time that it is trying to squeeze out existing subsidies. **********''The Universal Service Fund is simply too big to encourage competition and deregulation,'' said Thomas Duesterberg, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who specializes in telecommunications issues. **********Sharon L. Nelson, the chairman of the Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission, said she was worried that the F.C.C. could wind up shifting the onus for rate increases to the states. **********Mr. Hundt acknowledged that the F.C.C. faced a hard slog as it began the next phase of deregulation: determining the cost of providing affordable phone service to rural areas. **********But given the whirlpool of competing economic, political and commercial interests that the F.C.C. escaped this time around, Mr. Hundt was allowing himself to savor yesterday's achievement. **********''Unlike Houdini, we did not do this in a locked safe underwater,'' he said.

But some second and third thoughts may be in order before you start packing. **********Worth's rating is focused on money, dependent solely on median home prices -- with the assumption that whatever else makes the living good will follow in the wake of wealth. Money's rankings are based on statistics and survey results in nine categories: the economy, health care, crime, affordable housing, education, weather, transportation, leisure activities and the arts. The results are sometimes quirky. **********John Koten, Worth's editor, defended his magazine's second annual survey, ''The Richest Towns,'' against reader criticism last year that such an article didn't belong in an investing magazine. **********''Where to reside is one of the most important financial decisions anyone can make,'' Mr. Koten writes. ''That means the towns we include are those that the market has, for one reason or another, deemed among the most desirable. They're valuable places to live because they provide connections to  society's movers and shakers; because they're (usually) near places where fortunes are being made, and because they offer privacy, prestige and comfort. These are all things that help successful people become even more successful -- certainly one definition of a worthy investment.'' **********Worth says the richest town is Matinecock, population 880, on the North Shore of Long Island. The town's median home price is $1.5 million and there are seven local  country clubs. But don't rush to call your real estate agent; Worth says homes there rarely come on the market. **********The others in the top 10, along with median home prices, are: Aspen, Colo., $1.4 million; Rolling Hills, Calif., $1.1 million; Centre Island, N..Y., $999,000; Snowmass Village, Colo., $975,000; Rancho Sante Fe, Calif., $970,000; Atherton, Calif., $967,500; Hillsborough, Calif., $931,500; Jupiter Island, Fla., $922,500, and Kapalua, on Maui in Hawaii, $900,000. These are all small places, ranging from a population of 12,300 in Rancho Santa Fe (yes, the site of the Heaven's Gate suicides) to 408 in Kapalua. **********The list includes 238 towns -- wealthy areas of larger cities are not counted -- and the cutoff point for home value is $300,000. **********Unlike the 1996 ratings, this year's do not take household income into account. States with the most rich towns are California, 78; New York, 55, and New Jersey, 24. Most of the high-priced real estate can be found near San Francisco (Silicon Valley money), Los Angeles (Hollywood megabucks) and New York (Wall Street wealth). **********The whole exercise is a paean to money. The writer, Jane Berentson, senior editor of Worth, waxes enthusiastically that Aspen's home values get ''a boost from wealthy celebrities, people like former Playboy cover girl Barbi Benton and her husband, George 'Mobile-Home King' Gradow.'' **********Money magazine takes a broader, more statistical approach in ''The Best Places to Live Today,'' by Carla Fried with Jeanhee Kim and Amanda Walmac. It ranks 300 towns, cities and areas, big and small. **********The winner is Nashua, N.H., where a four-bedroom house costs $125,000 (and the property tax is $3,700), the unemployment rate is 2.3 percent and there is no sales tax or state and local income tax. The rest of the top 10, in order, are: Rochester, Minn.; Monmouth and Ocean Counties, N.J.; Punta Gorda, Fla.; Portsmouth, N.H.; Manchester, N.H.; Madison, Wis.; San Jose, Calif.; Jacksonville, Fla., and Fort Walton Beach, Fla. **********Dead last on the list is Davenport, Iowa, and Money all but apologizes for it. ''Residents feel their place is a pretty darn fine spot to live,'' the article says. But despite 42 miles of picturesque bike trails, six museums and three riverboat gambling casinos, the city still comes up short. The region's overall violent crime rate, an important factor in Money's poll of readers, is 27 percent higher than the national average.  And it's a three-hour trek to Chicago for top restaurants and major league sports. **********BUSY BANDWAGON The crowded field of personal-finance magazines is beginning to breed look-alikes -- at least on their covers.  Forbes and Fortune, which have long had sections dealing with personal finance, appear to have joined the fray. **********Forbes's June 16 issue, containing an annual investment guide, has a cover article on second careers as the key to successful retirement. The cover could have been designed by Money; the photograph shows an aerobics instructor going through her paces.

Even the venerable Economist, on its May 31-June 6 cover, features a cartoonlike drawing of a tax collector chasing a man with a cellular phone around a spinning globe. It illustrates an article titled''The Disappearing Taxpayer,'' about the difficulty of assessing and collecting taxes in a global, high-technology economy. **********LISTEN UP, FED David Hackett Fischer, a professor of history at Brandeis University, argues in the July-August issue of Bloomberg Personal that the Federal Reserve is obsessed with inflation fears and runs the risk of prompting a world depression. **********CREDIT WHERE DUE Kiplinger's and Money see bright spots for women in terms of credit and pensions. Kiplinger's notes that for the first time men and women who are business owners have about the same access to business capital, according to the Census Bureau and the National Foundation for  Women Business Owners. Money says women could get bigger pensions under proposals in Congress, including one that would expand the so-called homemaker individual retirement account. **********ON THE WEB Money's World Wide Web site (www.money.com) offers links to what it considers top Internet spots for information on stocks, mutual funds, financial calculators and the like.

The economy, she said, showed ''no clear signs of overheating or serious imbalance.'' **********The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said today that the Clinton Administration was focusing on the core rate component of the Producer Price Index ''because a large part of the increase reported is due to the home heating oil and gasoline price increases.''

The price of oil for February delivery has climbed back above $26 a barrel from the low $20 range a month ago. And the Goldman, Sachs & Company industrial metals commodity index has increased about 2 percent since the end of December."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/13/business/building-a-classier-image-las-vegas-hotels-woo-blue-chip-visitors.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1997-11-13", "snippet": "In Las Vegas, Nev, where crassness has long trumpeted classiness, new trend is to build luxury hotels designed to attract upscale vacationers; hope is that they will spend more money on food, lodging and entertainment, even as they lose less money...", "word_count": 1766, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Building a Classier Image; Las Vegas Hotels Woo Blue Chip Visitors", "print_headline": "Building a Classier Image; Las Vegas Hotels Woo Blue Chip Visitors", "body_text": " **********The newest way to make an impression on the garish Las Vegas Strip is through Impressionism itself. The Bellagio, a luxury hotel being built in a city known for its girlie shows, clanging slot machines and the Liberace Museum, will have its hallways graced by about $130 million worth of paintings by the likes of Renoir, Monet and Picasso. **********Down the road, Circus Circus Enterprises, known for a flagship hotel that features $29 rooms, $3 all-you-can-eat buffets and trapeze acts high above the blackjack tables, is building a resort that will include a hotel managed by the tony Four Seasons Hotels Inc. **********Las Vegas is adding a little elegance to its ebullience, a little class to its crass. The latest mantra here is go upscale: attract upper-middle-income vacationers -- not necessarily avid gamblers -- who might normally head for Palm Springs or La Jolla, Calif.; Scottsdale, Ariz., or Santa Fe, N.M. **********Behind the move is a change in the economics of Las Vegas. In the past, rooms, food and entertainment were mainly loss leaders, sold cheaply to lure customers into the casino. **********But as Las Vegas has broadened its appeal, the average visitor is dropping less at the roulette table. At the low-priced Circus Circus hotel, for instance, ''A lot of people are sleeping there but not playing the casinos,'' said Glenn Schaeffer, the president of the parent company. **********So he and other casino owners are trying something radical: to turn a profit on rooms, food, entertainment and shops. In 1996, these nongambling revenues accounted for 47 percent of the Strip's total, up from 42 percent in 1990, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority says. **********Still, the average hotel rate for all of Las Vegas has only crept up to $58, so hotel keepers think there is room to charge even more by making accommodations more luxurious. Higher room rates are also needed to recover the costs of the extravagant theme hotels now under construction, like the $1.5 billion Bellagio, which hopes to charge an average of about $165 a night, a new high for Las Vegas. **********Risks abound in this strategy, though. Visitors may balk at high room rates if cheap ones are still plentiful, and giant hotels run the danger of becoming impersonal. Most important, though: Can Las Vegas absorb all these new rooms? **********Las Vegas, of course, has been redefining itself for a decade. **********In recent years it has shed some of its Sin City reputation and turned itself into a playland for middle-American families by building hotels with theme-park-like attractions -- erupting volcanoes, battling pirates and Greenwich Village street scenes. This attracted mainly low-budget vacationers lured by the inexpensive hotels and meals. **********But the latest moves, if they succeed, will broaden the market further and help transform this desert hub into a more traditional resort, with golf, tennis, spas, ritzy shopping centers and gourmet restaurants. **********The Bellagio is far from alone. The Desert Inn is just completing a $200 million renovation aimed at making it the first five-star hotel in Las Vegas. While most hotel-casinos require guests to run a gantlet of slot machines to find the registration desk, the Desert Inn, owned by the ITT Corporation, features a lobby five stories high, and not a bing or a bong within earshot. **********The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company is entering the Las Vegas market, agreeing to manage a 526-room hotel in the new 640-acre Mountain Spa Resort being built on the outskirts of the city by Jack Sommer, owner of the Aladdin Hotel. **********Ritz-Carlton and Marriott International, which owns 49 percent of Ritz, have also signed letters of intent to manage hotels to be built on the property of the MGM Grand. ITT's Caesars Palace, long considered one of the most upscale hotels, has just added a new, even more luxurious 1,200-room tower. **********The new establishments are not necessarily aimed at the high rollers who bet up to $200,000 on a single hand of baccarat. Las Vegas already treats them very well indeed. **********The Las Vegas Hilton offers high rollers free penthouse suites, each more than 12,000 square feet, with private pools and lawns, furnishings befitting Versailles, and tuxedo-clad butlers on duty 24 hours a day. **********Nor are the moves aimed at families with children. While the building of theme hotels has made Las Vegas more of a family place, gaming executives -- perhaps spooked by the murder of a 7-year-old girl in May in a casino in Primm, Nev. -- now say that was never the intention. **********''Every time I saw kids in Las Vegas they were crying,'' said Stephen F. Bollenbach, president and chief executive of the Hilton Hotels Corporation. Even Mr. Schaeffer of Circus Circus says: ''We're not McDonald's that advertises to kids. We're Wendy's, where parents want to go and the kids can find something to eat.'' No, the goal is more upscale visitors, yuppies and DINK's (dual income, no kids). **********The proportion of visitors bringing children, while doubling since 1990, is still only 11 percent, and that is why strategies are being re-evaluated. MGM Grand Inc. is cutting the size of its unprofitable theme park in half. It will use the space for the new Ritz and Marriott Marquis hotels, a conference center and a spa with six swimming pools, waterfalls, a river and private cabanas. **********And food, often neglected in a place famous for groaning breakfast buffets and unlimited prime rib, is also getting ritzier. One pacesetter has been Rio Hotel and Casino Inc., which has used fine food and an all-suite environment to become one of the faster-growing properties in the city. Still, insisted the chairman, Anthony A. Marnell 2d: ''Las Vegas is not trying to change its image. It's just addressing an apparent desire''  of more demanding consumers. **********Rio has hired well-known chefs like Jean-Louis Palladin, formerly of the Watergate Hotel. It spent about $400,000 to buy part of Andrew Lloyd Webber's wine collection when it was auctioned and added it to a large wine cellar run by a master sommelier from the Ritz hotel in London. Now, Rio is even thinking of opening a restaurant in New York. **********Other trendy restaurants that have opened in Las Vegas in the last few years are Wolfgang Puck's Spago, San Francisco's Fog City Diner and Mark Miller's Coyote Cafe. Bellagio will house the first branch of Le Cirque outside New York. **********As for high-end shopping, the Forum Shops, situated at Caesars Palace and developed by Simon DeBartolo Group, has been a big success since it opened in 1992 and has just doubled its size, adding retailers like Bernini, Emporio Armani and an F.A.O. Schwarz store with a three-story-high Trojan horse in front. Of course, this being Las Vegas, every locale must have a themed attraction, so statues come to life in the fountains, re-creating the destruction of Atlantis. **********Some business executives here worry about becoming too snobby. ''The danger is that Las Vegas loses the reputation as a bargain,'' said Ellis Landau, chief financial officer of the Boyd Gaming Corporation, which owns the Stardust hotel. ''We still need that.'' **********That, of course, assumes the upscale move succeeds, which is far from assured. ''It's awfully tough to change your product image and move upscale,'' Craig Sullivan, the chief financial officer at Primadonna Resorts, said at the recent World Gaming Congress and Expo here. In an attempt to change its image, for instance, Circus Circus, whose stock price has been battered this year from more than $37 to around $23, is thinking of changing its name. **********Even though business executives and higher-income vacationers might spend $200 or $300 a night on a hotel in New York or Los Angeles, that does not mean they will pay that much in Las Vegas, where perfectly decent rooms are available for less than $100. **********Some of the new high-end hotels will have thousands of rooms, making it hard to deliver personalized service. ''What happens is people are treated like cattle and the quality of the experience goes down,'' said John Koster, president of the Desert Inn, which has 715 rooms. **********Air service is another bottleneck. While overtaxed McCarran International Airport is adding new gates, it is served mainly by Southwest Airlines and America West Airlines, discount carriers without much first-class or business-class service. Direct flights from East Coast cities are rare. **********The biggest risk is whether Las Vegas can absorb all the high-class rooms and shopping malls. Las Vegas is in the midst of a building boom that over the next few years could add 20,000 to 60,000 rooms to the 104,000 already here. **********Named for a resort area in northern Italy, the 3,000-room Bellagio, being built by Mirage Resorts and scheduled to open in the fall of 1998, will have a nine-acre man-made lake with what is promised to be a spectacular fountain show. **********Hilton's 3,000-room Paris, to open in 1999, will cost about $760 million and feature a 50-story replica of the Eiffel Tower. In addition to its 400-room Four Seasons hotel, Circus Circus's $800 million Project Paradise will have its own 3,400-room aquatic-theme hotel-casino in which guests will be able to swim in a pool with sharks -- separated by an acrylic wall. **********The grandest of all, if it gets enough financing, might be the nearly $2 billion Venetian being built by Sheldon G. Adelson, who made his fortune selling the Comdex computer trade show to a Japanese entrepreneur. It will have 6,000 suites and will be a re-creation of Venice, complete with canals and gondoliers who croon in Italian. **********So far, the city has worked on the premise that supply breeds demand -- build it, and they will come. And sure enough, as the castle-shaped Excalibur, the pyramid-shaped Luxor and other theme hotels have sprouted one after another, the number of visitors has continued to rise. **********But this year, Las Vegas is feeling the effects of overbuilding. In the first eight months of the year, the supply of rooms rose 10 percent, but there were only 4 percent more visitors. So much for raising room rates. Rooms for two in midweek are being advertised for $35 at the Frontier and $55 even at the relatively high-end Rio. **********The Stratosphere, a new casino at the seedier north end of the Strip, built as a huge tower with a roller coaster on top, is operating under bankruptcy protection. Some other less spectacular properties are also ailing, and a shakeout is expected. **********''We are beyond building spaces, we are building conversation pieces,'' said Alex Yemenidjian, president and chief operating officer of MGM Grand, which is controlled by the financier Kirk Kerkorian. ''There will be eventually a half a dozen properties in Las Vegas that will command 90 percent of the public attention, and then every other property will be a dormitory.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/17/business/big-insurers-plan-to-increase-rates-on-large-vehicles.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1997-10-17", "snippet": "Some big insurers, alarmed by research showing that sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks are inflicting unusually costly harm to cars and their occupants in collisions, are raising liability rates on oversize vehicles in what could amount to l...", "word_count": 2176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BIG INSURERS PLAN TO INCREASE RATES ON LARGE VEHICLES", "print_headline": "BIG INSURERS PLAN TO INCREASE RATES ON LARGE VEHICLES", "body_text": " **********Alarmed by research showing that sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks are inflicting unusually costly harm to cars and their occupants in collisions, some big insurers are raising liability rates on the oversize vehicles in what could amount to the largest overhaul of liability coverage since the rise of no-fault laws a quarter-century ago. **********To convince auto makers that such vehicles must be modified to make them less dangerous, the insurers are also bankrolling new studies and planning an ambitious series of crash tests. **********For motorists, the pocketbook effects of the overhaul of insurance rates could prove startling: a liability rate increase of up to 20 percent for drivers of sport utility vehicles and pickups over the next several years and a cut of up to 10 percent for car owners. That will likely mean an extra $50 to $700 a year in liability insurance payments for the first group, depending on current rates, and a saving of $25 to $350 for car owners. **********Two of the nation's largest insurers, Farmers Insurance Group and the Progressive Corporation, have already begun changing the way they calculate their rates. Executives at Allstate, Nationwide, Geico and USAA said they were reviewing the issue but were unlikely to make any decisions until they had more data, including broad studies by industry groups that will not be completed until next spring. **********Actuaries for Farmers and Progressive said that the reason for their rate moves was simple: Their customers who drive sport utility vehicles and pickups have been incurring unusually expensive claims to cover the damage and injuries they inflict during accidents. Rather than continuing to spread the extra cost among all drivers, including car owners, these insurers are starting to set rates accordingly. **********''It's pretty obvious the size and weight of these vehicles and the way they're built is contributing to the loss experience,'' said Jonathan Adkisson, an actuary at Farmers, a unit of B.A.T. Industries and the nation's third-largest insurer after State Farm and Allstate. ''When an accident occurs, the heavier vehicles are more likely to inflict damage and injuries, and these result in larger claims, so it seems appropriate to charge the drivers of those vehicles higher premiums.'' **********The biggest sport utility vehicles, like the Ford Expedition and the Chevrolet Suburban, weigh 5,200 to 6,000 pounds, while midsize sedans typically weigh 2,900 to 3,300 pounds. Sport utility vehicles also ride higher off the ground, so they tend to override the occupant protection features of cars and tend to have stiff frames that crumple the other vehicle in crashes. **********Liability coverage applies only to property damage and injuries caused to others by the policyholder. Rates for collision coverage, which applies to repairs of a policyholder's own vehicle, already take into account the fact that sport utility vehicles and pickups suffer less damage in crashes. **********Separate rates to cover the policyholder's injuries generally do not take into account the extra protection that these bigger vehicles provide to their occupants but are beginning to do so. But adjustments to this coverage offset only a small part of the extra liability cost. **********Indeed, if the full liability rate increase goes into effect, drivers of sport utility vehicles and pickups will be paying substantially larger total insurance bills. **********Two groups in Washington, financed by most of the nation's insurers, are working on studies that will include 6 to 10 crash tests pitting sport utility vehicles against cars. The tests are partly intended to put pressure on Federal regulators, who have repeatedly postponed such studies. Regulators have just begun planning six crash tests, which will begin this winter. **********Two crash tests already conducted in Europe by independent researchers found that sport utility vehicles, because of their height and weight, caused substantial damage to cars' passenger compartments. **********The insurers want auto makers to design vehicles that are more compatible in crashes, said Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Highway Loss Data Institute, the Washington groups conducting the studies. ''We need the manufacturers to say, 'Wait a minute, what happens when the Ford Expedition hits the Ford Escort,' '' he said. The controversy over the safety of air bags had distracted insurers until recently from the more important safety issue of sport utility vehicles, he added. **********Auto industry executives say they are constantly conducting research into ways to reduce the damage their products inflict -- indeed, Ford has long been Detroit's leader on many safety issues. But they also contend that some incompatibility is inevitable because Americans want a range of vehicle sizes. Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for environmental and safety engineering, said that higher rates of seat belt use and reductions in drunken driving could yield greater safety gains than design changes in sport utility vehicles. **********While the number of very large sport utility vehicles is rising especially quickly, the likelihood that any single big sport utility vehicle will kill a car occupant is falling, according to new research by Ford. It attributes the improvement partly to greater use of seat belts and air bags, partly to better-designed cars and partly to a shift in who drives sport utility vehicles. Suburban families are increasingly replacing single men as owners. **********But what is particularly interesting about the Farmers and Progressive research is that unlike that of Ford, the insurers were able to take into account differences in driver age, sex, location and previous driving record. And what the insurers have found is further evidence of a safety problem: that the same driver will inflict considerably greater damage and injuries when driving a sport utility of almost any size than when driving a car. **********The industry research groups headed by Mr. O'Neill are conducting further studies. The safety institute intends to release a statistical study this fall of the death toll inflicted by sport utility vehicles and pickups. In a separate study next spring, the safety institute plans up to 10 crash tests. **********The data institute is drafting a third study, scheduled for release next April, that will look at insurers' costs to repair vehicles hit by sport utility vehicles and pickups. **********Kim Hazelbaker, the institute's senior vice president, who is overseeing the study, said that his initial computer data had already showed a significant problem that was likely to provoke industry action. The institute had earlier found that property damage liability costs for insurers from accidents involving large sport utility vehicles were 72 percent higher than for the average car. By contrast, property damage caused by large luxury cars was 19 percent below the average. **********The institute first studied the issue in 1994. But most insurers showed limited interest, Mr. Hazelbaker said, until sales of the biggest sport utility vehicles began surging a year ago and until a series of articles in The New York Times over the last seven months described the dangers that the bigger vehicles pose. **********Progressive actually began making slight adjustments to liability rates by vehicle model in the 1980's, and it has been moving to much larger adjustments over the last two years as the range of family vehicles on the road has widened. It now calculates liability rates based on a motorist's age, driving record and other variables and then increases the total by up to 20 percent for the bigger and most dangerous sport utility vehicles and pickups and by roughly 8 percent for smaller models. It subtracts 10 percent for the least dangerous car models. **********But Progressive has long been a maverick in the collegial insurance industry. Much more significant is the fact that before Farmers Insurance entered the Pennsylvania market last month, it quietly chose for the first time to file a rate schedule with regulators that adjusts liability  premiums by vehicle model. The move by Farmers puts pressure on existing insurers in Pennsylvania to follow suit; their alternative is to risk losing car owners who could find a better deal at Farmers while being stuck with less profitable drivers of sport utility vehicles. **********It is not clear how fast competition will force insurers nationwide to adjust liability rates by model. Insurers have been reluctant to move quickly -- even Farmers has not decided to act in its more established markets. Calculating such rates can be expensive, requiring the training of agents and the reprogramming of computers. An insurer that imposes big rate increases for sport utility vehicles could also drive many customers to rivals that do not raise rates. Insurers, performing similar calculations to those Progressive has made, are likely to make comparable rate adjustments, as Farmers has already done in Pennsylvania. **********Adjusting rates by vehicle would be the biggest change in automotive liability insurance since no-fault laws became popular in some states a quarter-century ago, said Howard L. Cohen, vice president for actuarial research at Geico. No-fault laws tend to make liability insurance less expensive but do not eliminate it. **********Only one big insurer is actively hostile to adjusting liability rates by model: State Farm, the industry leader with 18.8 percent of the market. Dale Nelson, a State Farm actuary, said the insurer tracked its combined bodily injury and property damage liability costs by model and had found higher costs only for large pickup trucks, which it has not bothered to reflect in its rates. **********But State Farm's experience often differs from other insurers because it has an unusual number of older, rural customers. And Mr. Nelson's views offer little reassurance for car drivers: sport utility vehicles may actually save insurers money in a few accidents, he said, by killing people who might otherwise have survived with serious injuries. Severe injuries tend to produce larger settlements than deaths, he explained. **********The Allstate Insurance Group is more interested in adjusting liability rates. ''What I would envision is a liability system that varies rates more finely by make and model,'' said Michael A. LaMonica, Allstate's vice president for automotive insurance pricing. **********The industry's trade groups are convinced that liability rates by model are almost inevitable. Sean Mooney, chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute in New York, said that the growing power of computers made it easier to calculate rates based on more variables and that competition forced insurers to use such calculations. **********Since the 1970's, insurers have been using vehicle model data to calculate rates for theft and collision insurance. Sport utility vehicles are so sturdily built and so heavy that they suffer relatively little damage in crashes, and this is reflected in generally lower collision rates for them. Because liability rates are not similarly adjusted, the overall cost of insuring a sport utility vehicle can actually be cheaper now than insuring a similarly priced car. **********Most insurers also do not adjust their rates by vehicle model for personal injury insurance, which covers some initial expenses for injuries suffered by a policyholder during an accident. Because occupants in sport utility vehicles and pickups suffer slightly fewer injuries in accidents, Farmers offers them a lower rate for this coverage in Pennsylvania and Progressive does so nationwide. But the reduction offsets only a small fraction of the higher liability rates imposed by those companies because personal injury coverage does not include pain and suffering payments or legal fees and thus is much cheaper than liability coverage. Only 40 percent of all insured motorists nationwide take personal injury insurance because it is required by just 13 states, including New York, and often overlaps with employer-provided health care policies. **********Rather than calculate liability rates by model, many insurers have been relying instead on rules of thumb that were developed decades ago. Allstate, for instance, gives a 10 percent discount on bodily injury and property damage liability rates for subcompact cars weighing less than 2,100 pounds because lighter vehicles do less damage in collisions. But Allstate does not charge extra for sport utility vehicles that weigh three times as much. **********The Insurance Services Office, which is owned mainly by 643 small insurers and helps them calculate rates, uses an equally outdated system. It has five broad categories based on the ratio of a vehicle's weight to horsepower, a system calculated in the 1970's to penalize sports cars that are lightweight but very powerful. But that formula now puts sport utility vehicles in the best category for liability insurance because of their weight. **********''The system just doesn't work anymore,'' said Chris Guidette, a spokesman for the Insurance Services Office, adding that the office plans to begin computer analyses soon to develop a better system. **********The question now is whether higher rates will affect the sale of sport utility vehicles. When insurers raised collision rates for so-called muscle cars in the 1970's, sales slumped. **********But buyers of sport utility vehicles are often so prosperous that they may not notice the extra cost. The typical Chevrolet Suburban buyer now earns more than the typical Cadillac buyer, while the average household buying a Range Rover or Lexus LX450 earns $360,000 a year. **********To leave the rates as is, however, could open the insurance industry to criticism, Mr. Mooney said. Flat liability rates tend to put an unfair burden on lower-income car drivers, who are in effect subsidizing the affluent owners of sport utility vehicles, he said. **********''That's an issue that we certainly have to look at,'' Allstate's Mr. LaMonica said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/30/business/mitsubishi-motors-says-profits-tumbled.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-05-30", "snippet": "Mitsubishi Motors Corp says pretax profit onits worldwide operations plunged almost 70 percent, to 9.5 billion yen ($81.6 million), in year ended March 31; net income worldwide fell 8.9 percent, to 11.6 billion yen (S)", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mitsubishi Motors Says Profits Tumbled", "print_headline": "Mitsubishi Motors Says Profits Tumbled", "body_text": " **********The Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Japan's fourth-largest auto maker, said pretax profit on its worldwide operations plunged almost 70 percent, to 9.5 billion yen ($81.6 million), in the year that ended on March 31 after it wrote down losses on its United States sales unit.

After six years of independence, growth is still negative while privatization has moved at a snail's pace. **********July saw some positive developments. Observers were encouraged by the resignation of the reform-averse prime minister, Pavlo Lazarenko. The state budget was finally passed, albeit seven months late. **********Yet, Ukraine has yet to attract significant amounts of large-scale foreign investment since the demise of the Soviet Union. The situation has slightly improved over the course of this year, reflecting low inflation and a committee established with foreign investors to monitor financial conditions in the country. **********The weak attraction for investors is harming the country's economic development. **********\"In Ukraine, this is where reform progress has been weakest,\" said Michael Friedlander, head of economic research at Nomura International in London. \"Foreign investment aids restructuring and the development of export-orientatedindustries.\" **********Nomura two weeks ago underwrote a $450 million one-year note for Ukraine in the country's debut on the international bond market, and the issue has done well. It was sold at a yield of about 9.44 percent and ended this week at 8.80 percent, illustrating some investor confidence. **********But more typical of Ukraine's recent history was Motorola Inc.'s March decision to withdraw from a potentially lucrative satellite-communications deal, blaming an unstable business environment. Foreign investors are accustomed to red tape, paying kickbacks and retroactive legislation, but the biggest problem, several said, is Ukraine's illogical and onerous tax system. **********The system allows authorities to demand levies well in excess of 100 percent, often retroactively and without warning. Businesses that the tax system has not discouraged or pushed into bankruptcy have instead been pushed underground. **********\"When transition started in Ukraine, the shadow economy was around 12 percent of GDP. Today, it is at least 50 percent and maybe even more,\" said Daniel Kaufmann, former World Bank representative in Kiev, now with the Harvard Institute of International Development. **********Despite widespread recognition of the problem, the Parliament (the Rada) has rebuffed attempts to reform the tax system. **********At the beginning of the year, then Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Pyznenek presented a package to the Rada that he said would lower the burden, simplify collection and thus actually increase the overall tax take. **********Four months later, in April, he resigned in protest at the Rada's failure to pass the bill. In late June, the Rada finally passed the reform, in a watered-down version, with only two of the original 11 proposals going through. The remaining nine are to be discussed in the coming month. **********What astounds observers is that the Rada's resistance to the reform has persisted despite warnings that the economy faces negative growth this year and in 1998 following last year's 10 percent contraction in gross domestic product. **********In a study that incorporates findings taken from a representative survey of 50 firms in Kiev and Lvov, Mr. Kaufmann argues that Ukraine's tax and import duty regime have bred systematic misreporting. **********Firms typically \"hide\" 40 percent of their profits, over-report their costs by 135 percent and, thanks to onerous payroll taxes, which include both social security contributions and a special Chernobyl tax, under-report their payroll by 51 percent. **********Mr. Kaufmann suggests that high taxes explain Ukraine's poor record in attracting foreign investment, and the Finance Ministry's inability to meet revenue targets, thanks to a \"Laffer-curve effect.\" **********Almost as bad news is the amount of time the bureaucracy requires companies to spend dealing with it over matters such as licenses and paperwork **********Mr. Kaufmann's sample found that over 1996, companies spent an astonishing 40 percent of the working day dealing with officials, 10 percent more than in 1995. This compares with 30 percent in Russia, but only 15 percent in Lithuania and a mere 8 percent in another developing market a continent away: El Salvador. **********Given such figures, it seems hardly surprising that private enterprise prefers to exist in the shadows, where at least it will know how much protection money must be paid to organized crime. **********Yet, the effect of a sustained gray economy is significant. **********Not only do these companies not contribute to tax revenue but, because they do not officially exist, they also cannot borrow from legitimate sources and cannot, therefore, grow.

Cocallas of Fairfield, Calif., who blames a recent inability to get through to the service for costing his small computer-parts supply company a $3,000 order.

The company has promised to spend $350 million to increase capacity and has said the problems will be resolved by June. America Online, which is based in Dulles, Va., and surpassed eight million subscribers last week, reached the pact with the attorneys general of 36 states on Wednesday after the prosecutors threatened to sue the company for deceptive business practices. Moving away from charging users for each hour spent on line, the company began offering -- and aggressively promoting -- a new price plan early last month that promised unlimited access to the service for $19.95 a month. **********But the company seemed to underestimate both existing users' appetite for on-line time and the number of new customers the offer would attract -- 1.4 million since last October. By the middle of last month, many America Online subscribers faced interminable busy signals whenever they tried to dial into the service with their computer modems. **********America Online still offers hourly rates, but the company said a vast majority of its customers now subscribed to the unlimited-use plan. **********Under the agreement the attorneys general will not file lawsuits against America Online. In exchange, the company will give subscribers who request it compensation ranging from a full, $19.95 refund for customers who used the service for less than two hours during either December or January to a 25 percent, $5 rebate for users who spent between 8 and 15 hours in either month on line. The company has said that the settlement will cost less than $50 million. **********Customers who spent more than 15 hours on America Online in either December or January are not eligible for a refund for that month, though all customers can choose to receive a free month of service if they write to an address in Utah. **********That satisfied the attorneys general but was an affront to some America Online subscribers. **********''Nonsense. Total nonsense,'' said Peter J. Magliarditi, describing the deal. Mr. Magliarditi, an independent researcher in Lewiston, N.Y., is seeking class-action status in Federal District Court in Buffalo along with 100 other America Online customers for a lawsuit against the company for breach of warranty. ''They are punishing the people who tried the hardest to get on line by giving them no refund,'' he said. **********But Mr. Case defended the refund plan as fair. ''The sense was that for someone who used 100 hours in a month, a refund was less appropriate than for someone who used 10 minutes in a month,'' he said. ''The principle that has been guiding our thinking all along was that we've spent a decade building this brand and we want to do everything necessary to protect it and enhance it.'' **********That thinking appeared to please investors -- shares of America Online closed up 62.5 cents, at $37.875, on the New York Stock Exchange, after a big increase on Wednesday -- but did not go over well with Roberta Rosenfield, a retired schoolteacher in Nanuet, N.Y., who has subscribed to America Online for two years. **********''I called the number they gave and held on for 40 minutes,'' she said. ''It's a mess. During those 40 minutes they repeated a list of 15 other numbers to call for this or that.

The terms of a 1995 Justice Department decree forbid Microsoft from tying the licensing of one product to another. **********Microsoft executives counter that Internet Explorer, a World Wide Web navigation program, is not a separate product from Windows 95, but an improvement to it, even though the two are often purchased separately. Web navigation, the company argues, is an extension of the Internet access already in the operating system. **********''Our success comes from being able to innovate in all these directions,'' Brad Chase, a Microsoft vice president, said. ''Telling us we can't improve Windows is telling us we can't compete.'' **********Next year, the company intends to dramatize this point further with the next major release of the operating system, Windows 98, which fully integrates Internet Explorer. Microsoft officials argue that it is not possible for the industry to establish solid boundaries between functions that belong in the computer's operating system and those that belong only in other applications, like a Web browser. At a conference last week, Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, indicated the company had no intention of changing, describing several further planned enhancements. **********Those include speech recognition, allowing the computer user to operate the computer with voice commands, and ''machine vision,'' -- the computer's ability to recognize a particular user and respond to his behavior and expressions. **********For Richard Gilbert, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, the issue comes down to how much usefulness a particular feature adds to the operating system, and how broadly it will be used. He compared it with the Justice Department's investigation long ago of the Chrysler Corporation for requiring customers to buy a radio with every new car. Now consumers expect a radio in every new car. **********''Microsoft is kind of like Chrysler then,'' said Professor Gilbert, who was chief economist in the Justice Department during the investigation of Microsoft that led to the signing of the consent decree in 1995. He added, ''Antitrust law is about protecting consumers, not protecting rivals.'' **********Professor Gilbert said he expected the Justice Department's complaint to be decided narrowly, on the straightforward issue of whether Microsoft violated the decree by coercing its licensees. The issue of whether the company has the right to incorporate previously separate functions into its operating system will meet the test at a later point, he said, adding, ''I don't think we should build a case against Microsoft simply because they're able to build a Web browser into their operating system and provide more functionality.'' **********Not everyone agrees. Edward J. Black, president and chief executive of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said the industry was capable of defining the boundaries of an operating system. **********''The idea that the operating system can be this huge, constantly expanding bubble goes against what most people view as what an operating system needs to do,'' he said. **********Granted, Microsoft has a long history of taking features that were once the basis of distinct software programs and absorbing them into its operating system. Today from within Windows 95, for example, computer users can send a fax, compress files, send E-mail messages and write simple documents. Not  long ago, each of these functions required the user to buy a freestanding software program. **********In many cases, Microsoft's enhancements to the operating system led to the demise of software providers, third-party markets. **********But Microsoft officials have long argued that enhancing the operating system benefits customers. ''To remain competitive in software, you have to add new stuff, new functionality,'' said Stewart Alsop of New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif. **********But, he added, ''The fact that this issue now exists in the open makes it tempting to think of Microsoft as either right or wrong,'' Mr. Alsop said.

But when they do take place, everyone agrees that it is, in the end, up to the shareholders to decide who should run the company they own. **********But that's not the case in one of the most fascinating battles for corporate control now being fought. That battle is taking place at the Student Loan Marketing Association, better known as Sallie Mae, which is in the process of converting from a Government-sponsored enterprise to a completely private company. **********As a result of that unusual status, Sallie Mae now has a board that includes members never elected by the shareholders. Also as a result of that status, the current battle is not subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which probably would not stand for the tactics being used to entrench management. **********Sallie Mae has led an exciting life since President Clinton was elected. He proposed having the Government make direct loans to students, thus effectively cutting out Sallie Mae, which buys such loans from banks. The stock plunged, and then fell further when 1994 profits were disappointing. **********In 1994, a management-suite dispute resulted in the departure of the chief operating officer, Albert A. Lord, leaving the company's chief executive, Lawrence A. Hough, solidly in control. Then, in 1995, Mr. Lord and a slate of his associates waged a bitter proxy fight. After the court battles were through, Mr. Lord and seven associates were elected. But Mr. Hough had the support of six directors chosen by shareholders and of seven additional members appointed by President Clinton. So he kept control without the support of most holders. **********Last year, everyone was content to keep the status quo, and there was no proxy battle. The company made progress, thanks to cost-cutting and other moves, for which both sides take credit. And then, in September, Congress approved a bill allowing the company to be privatized, assuming a plan is approved by shareholders and directors by March 1998. If not, the company will be phased out. That, it appears, would be a disaster for shareholders. **********Now we have the company's plan, which shareholders will vote on in May. The plan contains all kinds of anti-takeover provisions and would establish a new board. The dissidents are not to be on that board (they were offered 2 of 18 seats, but turned them down). There is to be no election for the board, just a vote on approving the reorganization plan. **********If the plan is approved, there will be no shareholder vote on directors in 1997, and in 1998 only a third of the board will be up. So dissidents -- who won the last contested shareholder vote -- could not conceivably take control until 1999. And maybe not then. The plan would let the board enlarge itself and appoint new members, who might still have a majority even after two elections. **********Mr. Lord's group is trying to get holders to schedule another meeting, but it is unclear when such a meeting would be held or what it could accomplish, just as it is unclear whether the board would amend its plan even if shareholders were in rebellion. **********This battle looks like a grab for power, on both sides. And the ones to decide the victor ought to be the shareholders. By arranging things so that shareholders can vote only on on a needed reorganization plan, and not on directors, the board has struck a blow against democracy. **********It may be legal.

Last week, the scandal involved Martin E. Hanaka, the president of Staples Inc., who resigned after a subordinate accused him of assaulting her during an argument after what the company described as a ''personal relationship'' between the two. **********The company concluded that Mr. Hanaka had violated its ''fraternization policy,'' prohibiting managers from having a personal or romantic relationship with a subordinate, a Staples spokeswoman said. **********Mr. Hanaka declined to discuss the matter, but a spokeswoman has been quoted as saying there was no romantic relationship. **********Almost as surprising as the public resignation and accusation against Mr. Hanaka is the fact that Staples, founded in 1986, had a written policy on what is forbidden. **********The military, as Americans have learned, has rigorous rules against fraternization, but most civilian concerns lack any written policy, according to experts in the field. In an informal survey of a half-dozen of the nation's biggest companies, only two -- General Motors and Wal-Mart -- said they had a written policy on employee fraternization, although three reported less formal rules. **********A 1994 survey by the American Management Association, an organization with 10,000 corporate members, found that only 6 percent of those responding had a written policy on employee dating. **********''I think some companies are afraid to delve into this tricky area and are afraid of offending employees and afraid of lawsuits,'' said Michael D. Karpeles, lead employment lawyer at a Chicago law firm, Goldberg, Kohn, Bell, Black, Rosenbloom & Moritz. ''I think the employees rightly or wrongly will think that the company is trying to intrude into their private lives.'' **********AT&T used to have a written policy discouraging dating between any employees, said Burke Stinson, senior public relations manager there. But that was discarded in 1984. ''The idea shifted from this regimented approach to one of benign neglect,'' he said. Now, the company has an informal, unwritten policy that applies only to supervisors, who are made to understand that dating subordinates is a problem, which is resolved by a transfer, not a dismissal. **********Whether companies need such policies depends on whom you ask. Mr. Karpeles said companies should, in writing, ban relationships between a supervisor and a subordinate. Such relationships can call the manager's judgment into question and create morale problems because other employees suspect that the boss is showing favoritism. **********He said that if such a relationship soured, it could open up the company to accusations of sexual harassment. And, of course, sexual harassment can exist even if there is no romantic involvement. **********According to the American Management Association survey, one-third of the men and 15 percent of the women who reported having an office romance said they had had one with a subordinate. Over all, 37 percent the women said they had had an office romance, compared with only 20 percent of the men. **********Mr. Karpeles doesn't recommend forcing out either love-struck offender. Instead, he suggests transferring one of them or at least having an objective supervisor evaluate the subordinate's performance. **********That seems to be the tack followed at General Electric. The company has no written policy dealing with fraternization, said Bruce Bunch, a company spokesman. But, he added: ''Our practice is, where we are aware of a personal relationship between two employees, we take steps to insure that one does not supervise the other. We want to make sure it's very clear that at G.E. recommendations about salary and promotions are based solely on job performance.'' **********Other companies sometimes rely on quiet persuasion to end an affair involving an executive. Mr. Karpeles tells of the chairman at a Chicago-area company who had a little talk with the president to let him know his affair had become an issue in the office and to ask him to think about whether this was good for the company. The president, Mr. Karpeles said, ended the relationship. **********In-house romances that involve adultery are especially disconcerting to companies, said Kathleen Reardon, a management professor at the University of Southern California and author of a book about men and women in the workplace, ''They Don't Get It, Do They?'' (Little, Brown $12.95). She said companies were often reluctant to accuse someone of adultery without proof and were even more unwilling to get that proof. Instead, she said, the employee might be told, ''It's your life but that doesn't go down well with people upstairs around here.'' **********Companies have to be careful about singling out married workers for discipline, Mr. Karpeles added, because most states have laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of marital status. Any nonfraternization rules must apply equally to single lovers and married ones, he said. **********Both Mr. Karpeles and Dr. Reardon said companies tended to simply leave amorous employees alone unless a supervisory relationship was involved. Less than 1 percent of the executives in the 1994 survey said their companies banned all employee dating. And 74 percent said they thought it was O.K. to date a co-worker, although only 21 percent approved of dating a subordinate. **********As more women work alongside men and employees pull longer hours, affairs are bound to occur, Mr. Karpeles said. A rule designed to stamp them out would be ''laughably unreal,'' he said. ''You can't stop love.'' **********Then, of course, there is the prospect of a counterattack from the outcast lovebirds. Wal-Mart was sued in 1993 by a couple found to be dating while one was still married, albeit separated. The New York Attorney General weighed in with a second suit, contending that Wal-Mart's action violated a state law prohibiting businesses from dismissing employees for lawful activities occurring outside the workplace. Both suits were later dismissed. **********In the Silicon Valley, Lawrence J. Ellison, head of the Oracle Corporation, dated an Oracle administrative assistant, Adelyn Lee, for about 18 months starting in 1991. She was dismissed, and filed a suit contending wrongful termination, saying she had been bullied into having sex. **********Mr. Ellison testified that he had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lee, but said he did not order her fired. **********Oracle agreed to pay Ms. Lee $100,000 in her wrongful-termination case, and she agreed to retract her accusations. But in a twist, she was later convicted of perjury and falsifying documents for sending a phony E-mail message to help in her suit. She was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to return the $100,000. An appeal has been filed, and the case is pending. **********John Challenger, executive vice president of the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said his company handles about a dozen cases annually in which a manager has been pushed out after an affair with a subordinate. **********He said companies sometimes rethink dismissing the subordinate, who is usually a woman. Worried about sexual harassment suits, ''They end up backtracking and trying to keep the person,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/17/business/avenor-to-sell-its-stake-in-lumber-venture-to-partner.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-07-17", "snippet": "Avenor Inc of Montreal will sell its 53 percent stake in Pacific Forest Products Ltd for $418 million (US); under agreement, TimberWest Forest Holdings and Avenor's partner in venture, will offer $21.18 (US) a share for Pacific's stock; as part of...", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AVENOR TO SELL ITS STAKE IN LUMBER VENTURE TO PARTNER", "print_headline": "AVENOR TO SELL ITS STAKE IN LUMBER VENTURE TO PARTNER", "body_text": " **********Avenor Inc. of Montreal said yesterday that it would sell its 53 percent stake in Pacific Forest Products Ltd. for $573 million (Canadian), or $418 million (United States).

Chernomyrdin announced a decision: They agreed to work on the problems over the next two months. **********From the moment Mr. Gore arrived in Russia, his strategy has been to nudge issues toward resolution. It is a deliberate approach that avoids open confrontation and minimizes the risk of embarrassing failure. **********Aides insist that Mr. Gore's workmanlike approach is vital to forging effective relations with the Russians. But it also makes Mr. Gore appear a less than dashing figure at a time when he is trying to demonstrate his skills as a statesman. **********If Mr. Gore had a favorite word this week it has been ''process.'' The two sides established a ''process'' for discussing American complaints that Russian scientists are selling missile technology to Iran, Mr. Gore noted proudly. They set up a ''process'' for airing their disagreements over a new bill that protects the Russian Orthodox Church from competition with other Christian faiths. And that was before tonight's ''process'' on oil investment disputes. **********To be sure, some of these processes have eventually yielded results. The two sides, for example, sealed an agreement today to halt the production of weapons-grade plutonium in Russia. **********Russia had agreed in 1994 to shut down three nuclear reactors used to heat the Siberian cities of Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk because of United States concerns that the plants also produce plutonium that can be used to make nuclear weapons. But Moscow later concluded that it could not carry out its pledge because it lacked the money to construct non-nuclear power plants. **********Under the new accord, the Russians will continue to operate the reactors but will convert them so that the plutonium they produce is not weapons-grade. The United States will pay the $70 million cost and the work is to be completed by 2000. American officials had hoped to sign the agreement months ago, but it was held up by bureaucratic snags within the Russian Government. **********But some emotionally charged disputes may not lend themselves to Mr. Gore's incremental approach. **********Mr. Gore criticized the religion bill passed by the lower house of Parliament on Friday, saying that it discriminated against minority religious groups. He stressed that American and Russian experts would get together to discuss the bill and how it might be changed. **********''We have set in motion a process that will convey to Russian officials the concern about certain aspects of this pending measure, which may abridge basic citizens' freedoms, as we read the language,'' Mr. Gore said. **********But Sergei Yastrzhembsky, spokesman for President Boris N. Yeltsin, told the Itar-Tass news agency today that Mr. Yeltsin was basically satisfied with the wording of the new bill and is likely to sign it. **********The dispute over billions of dollars in planning American oil projects will also be a difficult test. **********There are plenty of problems. Amoco has run into major difficulties with its Russian partners. Exxon was outraged when the Government revoked its right to develop oil in the far north. The Timan Perchora project, run by a consortium of Western and Russian oil companies, has been thwarted by local authorities. Major projects are also still awaiting parliamentary approval. **********To dramatize his case to Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Gore waved newspaper articles suggesting that Russia was acquiring a bad reputation among foreign investors. **********A senior American official said Mr. Gore had succeeded in focusing Russian attention on the oil problem. American and Russian experts are to study the issue for two months and issue recommendations for solving it. **********What will come out of the talks is unclear. The Russians have indicated that they will try to come up with a creative solution for Exxon's difficulties. **********Moscow has also reversed -- at least temporarily -- its decision to end the privileged access Conoco and two other companies enjoy to oil pipelines under joint ventures with the Russians. **********''We will eventually get to firm and final closure on these issues,'' a senior American official vowed tonight. ''It may take time but we will succeed. The key to success is that the leading figures do not think the other side is out to snooker them.'' **********Some oil executives, who have been struggling with the byzantine politics of oil for years here, were more skeptical. **********But few doubt that, come what may, Mr. Gore will slog on. Next year, the United States will host the tenth session of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission on Economic, Security and Scientific Issues.

McIntosh, a young, aggressive Republican from Indiana who became chairman of a House subcommittee on regulatory affairs after the 1994 G.O.P. sweep of Congress. At their high water mark little more than a year ago, Mr. McIntosh and his zealous band of deregulators appeared close to making huge strides in paring down the Federal regulatory apparatus. **********But it looks as if Mr. Whiton, along with millions of other American business owners and managers, will have to learn to live with the regulators after all. **********Following a rocky two-year voyage through the last Congress, the Republican effort to roll back decades of accumulated Federal regulations has stalled on the shoals of partisan conflict, Presidential politics and public doubt. With the White House out of reach for another four years and smaller majorities in Congress, Republicans have abandoned their crusade to sweep away the panoply of Federal health, safety and environmental edicts. **********In this less superheated environment, the talk in Washington instead is of incremental, bipartisan efforts to more carefully weigh the consequences of new rules. One leading initiative involves two Senators -- Carl Levin, a Democrat of Michigan, and Fred D. Thompson, a Republican from Tennessee -- who are working quietly toward a compromise plan to streamline Federal rule-making and require detailed cost-benefit analyses for major new regulations. **********But large battles still loom over where to draw the line between the promised benefits of Federal regulations and their very real costs. Even as Congress seeks a legislative truce, the Clinton Administration is moving forward on several fronts to enact broad new rules governing air quality, workplace safety, ergonomics, food purity and chemical exposure that may impose costly new requirements on business. **********The Environmental Protection Agency last November issued proposed rules on small dust particles and ozone in the atmosphere. The Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration is moving toward standards to reduce repetitive stress injuries in scores of industries from meatpacking to carpet laying. OSHA is also preparing to impose new limits on workers' exposure to methylene chloride, a toxic chemical used to strip paint. The Food and Drug Administration is proposing a new seafood inspection program. **********On his trip to Des Moines, Mr. Whiton, whose family-owned mill in central Iowa employs seven workers, asked Mr. McIntosh's help in easing rules generally designed for much larger operations. He likes to tell the tale of his father's citation by an inspector from OSHA for failing to have a toilet-paper holder in the mill's bathroom. **********''Who actually thinks up these rules?'' Mr. Whiton asked in a telephone interview. ''Of course we comply, but a lot of it is redundant and overbearing. We're just a small family operation, but we have to go through all the baloney the majors do.'' **********He finds the Transportation Department's random testing for drug and alcohol abuse for his three drivers particularly irksome. **********''I've got to give them a half-day off work and pay $50 for the test and their mileage,'' Mr. Whiton said. ''I can understand the reason for testing the interstate truckers, but my guys drive at most 50 miles, and I've known them all their lives.'' **********Mark Snider, a Transportation Department spokesman, said that substance abuse testing was required for all commercial trucking operations, regardless of the size of the fleet or the territory traveled. Mr. Snider noted that the regulation had survived several court challenges. **********Still, Administration officials contend that they, too, have been listening to people like Mr. Whiton. **********They are taking steps, they say, to ease the regulatory burden without abandoning the protections the Government provides against the risk of workplace injury, environmental damage and the like. Not only do they not intend to unleash a torrent of new rules, officials insist, they are also continuing to bring greater openness to the process and to replace a penalty-based model of enforcement with one emphasizing greater collaboration between government and industry. **********''What has made this arena so contentious is the feeling by business people that a lot of regulatory actions are capricious and coercive,'' said Elaine Kamarck, a senior aide to Vice President Al Gore and director of his ''reinventing government'' initiative. The Administration's intent, she added, is to alter ''the mindset of regulators from that of cops to making sure that people are complying with the law. This is a big, big change.'' **********As examples of the Administration's commitment to regulatory revisions, officials cite the elimination of 16,000 pages of superfluous rules from the Code of Federal Regulations and the enrollment of 115 companies in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program, which exempts employers from routine inspections if they meet minimum safety standards. **********This has been tried before. It was under President Ronald Reagan, for instance, that OSHA first turned from measuring its success by the amount of fines collected to voluntary programs aimed at reducing workplace accidents. C. Boyden Gray, who was chief counsel to Mr. Reagan's task force on regulatory relief, said that the Gore initiative was ''merely reinventing what we were doing.'' **********And Mr. Gray, now an industry lobbyist, questioned whether the effort extended to the E.P.A.'s enforcement of the Clean Air Act. ''They're still in the bean-counting mode over there,'' he asserted. **********Industry officials applaud the Administration's efforts to make regulators friendlier to business, even if they remain skeptical about its ultimate intentions. **********Indeed, much of the good will among business that the ''reinventing government'' moves generated was overwhelmed in late November when the E.P.A. proposed its sweeping new standards for airborne particulate matter and ozone -- soot and smog. The new rules, the first major revision of Clean Air Act standards since 1990, have touched off what amounts to a holy war between industry and Government. **********''This issue is our overriding concern,'' said Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers and a leader of an industry coalition formed to fight the new air quality rules. ''It imposes such high costs. This is absurd. Everything pales beside that.'' **********Like most bitter debates in Washington, this one boils down to two fundamental questions: How much will it cost? And who pays? **********Mr. Jasinowski said the new E.P.A. rules would throw hundreds of communities out of compliance with current air quality rules and cost business and local governments tens of billions of dollars in exchange for unproven health and environmental benefits. **********Federal health and safety officials, and the environmental and public-interest lobbies that prod them, argue that the Government is often under no obligation to take costs into account. Indeed, the Clean Air Act specifically requires that the E.P.A. ignore them when setting air pollution standards. Nonetheless, they say, clean air -- like uncontaminated water, safer workplaces and untainted food -- carries real benefits, not all quantifiable, that easily overwhelm the costs. **********Environmental officials, citing dozens of scientific studies, argue that the new air standards will result in 20,000 fewer premature deaths, 250,000 fewer cases of childhood respiratory ailments and 9,000 fewer hospitalizations for lung complaints a year. The agency estimates the health benefits at $58.1 billion to $120.5 billion a year, with only $6.6 billion to $8.5 billion in annual compliance costs by the year 2007. **********Business interests dispute these figures and reply that there is a tipping point at which the cost of these uncontrovertible benefits become a job-killing burden. **********Mr. McIntosh, who spearheaded the drive for a broad regulatory overhaul in the last Congress, said that he would continue to hold the Administration's feet to the fire. The Gore initiatives were a positive first step, he said, ''but we need to codify that in law so that agencies have to follow it as a matter of Federal law.'' **********Mr. McIntosh, who served earlier as director of the deregulation-minded White House Competitiveness Council under then-Vice President Dan Quayle, acknowledged the changed political calculus in the current Congress required a more restrained approach. ''Rather than one big regulatory reform law,'' he said, ''you'll see a series of free-standing initiatives, restrictions through the appropriations process and stricter oversight.'' **********He has found an unlikely ally in Senator Levin, who was instrumental in derailing the grandiose Republican regulatory rollback effort in the last Congress. **********Mr. Levin, the second-ranking Democrat on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, has long advocated mandatory cost-benefit and risk assessment studies for all major proposed Federal environmental and workplace rules -- the holy grail of the anti-regulation forces. But he has sought to tread a narrow path between his two most important constituencies, the United Auto Workers and the automobile manufacturers, who are often on opposite sides of regulatory battles. **********Mr. Levin said he intended to introduce a bill, almost certainly with Republican co-sponsors, that would be designed to force agencies to conduct cost-benefit studies before issuing new rules, but not necessarily bind the Government to the results. **********''There are occasions when Congress has decided that they wanted a health or environmental benefit to be achieved even if the benefit cannot justify the cost,'' Mr. Levin said. **********Senator Thompson, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, indicated that he and Mr. Levin were not far apart on the issue. ''Regulations have improved the quality of life, and we certainly have to keep that in mind,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''But we can do a lot better in terms of the quality of regulatory analysis; we can do a lot better in terms of making it more understandable, so there's more accountability. And we have to go back and review the old regulations from time to time.'' **********Gary Bass, director of O.M.B. Watch, an advocacy group that generally supports Government regulation, said he was surprised that Mr. Thompson and Mr. Levin would be discussing a bipartisan bill so soon after Democrats gained the upper hand politically by portraying Republicans as being cavalier about threats like choking hazards for children and bacterial contamination of hamburger. **********There are already laws on the books to guarantee the weighing of the relative costs and benefits of proposed new rules, Mr. Bass said. What is needed instead, he said, is more disclosure of industry lobbyists' behind-the-scenes manipulations of the rule-writing process. **********''Congress can't even pass a budget,'' Mr. Bass said. ''How can it review thousands of agency regulations each year? I just consider it meddling.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/17/business/media-business-advertising-expanding-their-range-infomercials-push-charitable.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-10-17", "snippet": "Unusual informercial that is scheduled to begin test run Oct 17 will seek charitable donations rather than sales; 30-minute informerical, to appear as paid programming on local television stations and cable networks, is titled 'Circle of Friends' ...", "word_count": 878, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING ; Expanding their range, infomercials push charitable donations rather than sales.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING ; Expanding their range, infomercials push charitable donations rather than sales.", "body_text": " **********AN unusual infomercial that is scheduled to begin a test run today will seek charitable contributions from viewers rather than beseech them to buy cookware, cosmetics or car wax. **********The glossy 30-minute infomercial, to appear as paid programming on local television stations and cable networks, is titled ''Circle of Friends'' after a fund-raising program for the American Paralysis Association, a nonprofit organization founded in 1982. The actor Christopher Reeve, who broke his neck two years ago in a horseback-riding accident, is the focus of the infomercial, which asks for donations to help find a cure for spinal-cord injuries and other causes of paralysis. **********Nabisco Inc. and its Snackwell's line of baked goods have donated $125,000 of the initial $150,000 being spent to buy commercial time for ''Circle of Friends.'' Mr. Reeve appears along with his wife, Dana; seven stars, five of them Oscar winners, and scientists involved in spinal-cord research. **********The project is emblematic of a trend that has seen infomercials enter eleemosynary realms, pitching causes instead of products. Other long commercials aimed at raising funds include appeals for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the Save the Children Federation. **********''In one way, it's unfortunate we have to do this'' to raise funds, said Fred Vanore, president of Vanore Productions, which produced the Reeve infomercial along with Global Vision Networks. ''In another way, we're lucky to have this ability to reach people.'' **********''I don't think it's bad that it's paid programming,'' he added, ''because when you get down to it, all programming is paid. This gives us time to tell our story.'' **********That story is told in an emotional manner intended to motivate viewers to donate to the association by calling toll-free telephone numbers or visiting its World Wide Web site.  There is an uplifting theme song, ''Shining Star,'' sung by Chaka Khan; gauzy biographical montages of Mr. Reeve; heart-tugging footage of paralyzed children, and glowing tributes to Mr. Reeve by Mel Gibson, Judith Light, Paul Newman, Rene Russo, Susan Sarandon, Meryl Streep and Joanne Woodward. **********The infomercial opens with footage from the film ''Superman,'' showing the Man of Steel (Mr. Reeve) rescuing Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). When she asks, ''Who are you?'' he replies, ''A friend.'' **********Then Ms. Sarandon, the host of the infomercial, comes on screen. ''In the movie 'Superman,' my friend Christopher Reeve was always there to catch someone just in the nick of time,'' she says. ''In real life, no one was there to catch him.'' **********Still, the tone and manner of ''Circle of Friends'' are much less hyperbolic than viewers are used to in product-selling infomercials or telethons. For instance, at one point, Mr. Reeve, in discussing his life before his accident, offers a wry joke, asserting that he considered himself ''pretty much bulletproof in fact -- no 'Superman' pun intended.'' **********And after some low-key banter between Mr. Reeve and Ms. Sarandon, she raises a question about his unflagging faith that a cure for paralysis is imminent. **********''You speak so optimistically,'' she says, ''but I've got to tell you, there's some people who tell you you're being just a little unreal.'' Mr. Reeve replies: ''I don't believe in false optimism. That really would be a waste of time. I believe in actually what can be done.'' **********Michael Manganiello, associate director of the Christopher Reeve Foundation, which last night presented $500,000 to the paralysis association for research, said: ''For so many years, spinal-cord injuries and diseases of the brain and central nervous system were considered so hopeless. But now the scientists know what they have to do; they just need the money to do it. **********''When you see Chris in the chair every day, it lowers your resistance to asking people favors,'' he continued, ''because you want to get him out of the chair.'' **********The donation from Nabisco marks its first such infomercial sponsorship, though the company has participated in other so-called cause-related marketing projects. **********''It's very different and innovative,'' said Ann Smith, a spokeswoman for Nabisco in Parsippany, N.J., a unit of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation. ''There's a good deal of promise that a cure is around the corner and if we could be a part of that, it would be wonderful.'' **********And of course a program-length television commercial is very different for the paralysis association. **********''You have to test the medium and see if it works,'' said Mitch Stoller, president and chief executive in Springfield, N.J. ''Based on research on other organizations that seem to have succeeded with the medium, it is worth the try.'' **********As for how much he hopes the infomercial can raise, Mr. Stoller said: ''I've been in the nonprofit sector for close to 16 years now. That's too long to think about predicting goals. You never know till you get out to the public, but my gut feeling tells me we'll do very well.'' **********If that happens, there could be a second installment of ''Circle of Friends,'' featuring additional stars like Tom Hanks. **********And if the infomercial ''is not raising money,'' Mr. Stoller said, ''we will not continue it, the same as with any other fund-raising vehicle.'' **********Whether or not ''Circle of Friends'' continues, more cause-related infomercials may be coming to a set near you.

In the 1940's he worked for the War Production Board, and later went on to work in the aviation industry and  as a Government housing executive. **********He later became a member of Rand's research council and chairman of Rand's research program on conflict in allied, neutral and satellite countries. The studies that he carried out at Rand in the 1950's were all done for one client, the United States Defense Department, and were for the most part highly secret. **********Soon after he joined Rand, a colleague there, Charles Hitch -- who later became an Assistant Secretary of Defense under Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara in the 1960's -- suggested that Mr. Wohlstetter carry out a research project about the selection and use of strategic air bases -- that is, air bases for nuclear bombers. There were no nuclear missiles until the mid-1950's. **********James Digby, a friend of Mr. Wohlstetter who worked with him at Rand, recalled yesterday that Mr. Wohlstetter's paper ''resulted in a change of Strategic Air Command's basing policy so that bombers were based far from the Soviet Union, and their bases, highly protected. This in turn led to the ability to strike back even after receiving a first attack by the Soviets.'' **********In the 1970's, after Mr. Wohlstetter had left Rand, he and his wife performed studies on the Persian Gulf  on behalf of Rand and with the Department of Defense as the client. These studies affirmed that the United States' European allies were highly susceptible to having important oil supplies blocked. **********Also in the 1970's, Mr. and Mrs. Wohlstetter increased their analyses of the ramifications of the spread of  nuclear weapons, and by some accounts that work led to changes in American law concerning the export of nuclear material, notably plutonium, and of nuclear technology. **********In addition to his wife, the former Roberta Morgan, whom he married in 1939, Mr. Wohlstetter is survived by a daughter, Joan Wohlstetter Hall of Manhattan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/09/business/big-hmo-a-victim-of-its-own-ambition.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big H.M.O. a Victim Of Its Own Ambition", "print_headline": "Big H.M.O. a Victim Of Its Own Ambition", "body_text": " **********Oxford Health Plans grew as it promised the convenience and savings of a health maintenance organization with the freedom to see any doctor by agreeing to share the cost. **********But Oxford has now become the victim of its own grand ambition.

Rohatyn found himself today in the middle of a full-fledged crisis over a $2 billion investment in Iran by the French oil company Total. **********French officials from President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on down have made little secret of their contempt, shared by most governments in Europe, for American legislation that threatens sanctions against foreign countries that invest more than $20 million in Iran. And on Monday, Mr. Jospin went so far as to express enthusiasm for the oil deal, which had been a long time in the making for Total and its Russian and Malaysian partners. **********''Why now?'' Mr. Rohatyn asked himself, in shirt sleeves during an interview today in his New Deal-era embassy office off the Champs-Elysees. He was apparently taken aback by the timing of Total's announcement and Mr. Jospin's support for it. **********''You know, at age 69, you are not surprised by much,'' he said. ''Does it poison the relationship between France and the U.S.? I hope not. I don't believe it will. It shouldn't.'' **********An open relationship, he said, would always have differences, but it should be able to overcome ''singular events'' like this one. **********Mr. Rohatyn, a former partner of the Lazard Freres investment firm in New York City, implied that conversations he and other American officials have had with Europeans in high places about their dealings with Iran had not led them to believe a major confrontation would be in the works so soon. **********Mr. Rohatyn presented his credentials to Mr. Chirac on Sept. 11, succeeding Pamela Harriman, who died on Feb. 5 after suffering a stroke. His perfect French and his expertise in the world of international finance both earned a warm welcome in the diplomatic and corporate salons of Paris, a capital preoccupied with preserving French influence in an increasingly competitive global economy that the French think is dominated by Anglo-Saxon interests. **********''Globalization doesn't carry a threat, but it carries discipline, and then you always have a notion that we are imposing an American-style Anglo-Saxon capitalism,'' he said.  ''People forget that 10 years ago, we were being written off, and Japan and Germany were going to take over the world. Now that, like a lot of economic predictions, turned out to be wrong.'' **********Mr. Rohatyn spoke coolly about the deal involving Total, which was once state-owned but is now almost entirely privately held. One way to view the issue, he said, was to see it as ''three private companies deciding to make an investment, recognizing that there are risks in this investment because it flies in the face of the law in the U.S.A.'' **********''They decided to make the investment, presumably because they thought the profit was greater than the risk, and they clearly knew the risk,'' he said. ''They evaluated it, and now they have to deal with it, whatever that risk turns out to be.'' **********Gazprom, a huge and politically influential Russian petroleum company, and Petronas, a Malaysian state oil firm, are partners with Total in the Iranian deal. **********Mr. Rohatyn would not say today what steps he thought the Clinton Administration would take under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, often called the D'Amato law after Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, a Senate sponsor. **********But he had an answer for French and other European critics of the D'Amato law and the Helms-Burton law relating to business dealings with Cuba; these critics complain that the laws are examples of attempts by Congress to legislate beyond American boundaries. **********''The issue of extraterritoriality, you know, that's a little bit like modern art,'' he joked. ''What is extraterritorial?'' **********After the European Union's executive commission threatened to disapprove the Boeing Company's merger with McDonnell Douglas last summer, he said, Boeing had to agree to remove exclusivity provisions from 20-year supply contracts with three domestic United States airlines -- American, Continental, and Delta. **********''A lot of people back home thought that was extraterritorial,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. ''It's not an open and shut issue.'' Beyond the problem of Total's decision to put $2 billion into exploitation of an Iranian gas field, he said, was a more important quandary facing Washington and its European allies. ''That is, how does the West, how the European Union, France, and the U.S. deal with the behavior of a state that can pose a danger to Western society,'' he said. **********Washington suspects that Iran has tried to develop nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them, with help from unemployed Russian scientists. The European Union has its own problems with Iran; its member states withdrew their ambassadors from Teheran last summer after a German court found Iranian leaders directly responsible for the killing of three Iranian Kurdish opposition figures in the bombing of a cafe in Berlin in 1992. **********''One of the unfortunate things about the timing of this,'' he said of Total's decision, ''is that it may get in the way of what I think is clearly a more important discussion.'' That, he said, would include an evaluation of a change in direction by the authorities in Iran after last summer's presidential election there. **********Keeping up good American relations with France despite continual French suspicions that America would secretly like to relegate its oldest European ally to the rank of a second-rate economic and military power bedevils every American ambassador to Paris. **********One of Mr. Rohatyn's jobs has been reassuring banking friends and the numerous French officials he has been calling on that the United States does not oppose the European Union plan to create a common European currency, the euro, in 1999. **********''We have an interest in a strong Europe, and Europe has an interest in a strong U.S.,'' he said. ''The euro is a European construction. The criteria of who should join, when, what the parities should be, are all very important, somewhat technical issues in which we have no say, and no preference. **********''There is this notion that we are threatened by the euro, that the dollar is threatened by the euro,'' he laughed. ''It is absolutely not true.  Our interest is in the outcome. If their decision is to go ahead, we hope that will be successful.''                     --------------------        Albright Criticizes France **********Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright strongly criticized France last night for supporting the Total project, expressing frustration that ''our friends and allies'' did not agree with the United States' efforts to isolate Iran because of its support for terrorism. **********Ms. Albright also said that while the election of Iran's new President, Mohammed Khatami, was ''intriguing,'' his Government had done nothing to change what she described as Iran's sponsorship of terrorism, its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and its efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process. **********''It is also a grave concern to us that our friends and allies don't get it,'' Ms. Albright said, speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City.

He recalled that he had begun to work on the technology in the early 1970's when the energy crisis prompted searches for greater efficiency. **********Despite the difficulties with getting his system out on the market, he said he had kept busy and gotten patents on other inventions like the Clapper, a device sold on television that turns lights on and off when someone claps his or her hands.

Lester Thurow says the reason is a global economy in which low-wage, foreign workers adversely affect the wages of American low-skilled workers. The problem is more basic. Much of what we produce does not contribute to our standard of living or quality of life. A prime example of waste in our economy is in military spending, the biggest item in the Federal budget.

But the excess tanks and other vehicles that are used for maneuvers or war games do not improve our national security. **********By moving jobs to education, the environment and other areas, low-income workers will benefit most. **********JACK SCARANGELLA **********New Rochelle, N.Y., Feb. 16"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/09/world/change-in-hong-kong-is-slow-but-sure.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1997-10-09", "snippet": "Changes both profound and trivial, visible and not, are reshaping Hong Kong in wake of Chinese takeover, even as much of Hong Kong life remains same; Tung Chee-hwa, presenting first state-of-the-territory address on 100th day of Chinese rule, deta...", "word_count": 1312, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Change in Hong Kong Is Slow but Sure", "print_headline": "Change in Hong Kong Is Slow but Sure", "body_text": " **********One hundred days after China raised its red flag here, ending 156 years of British colonial rule, Hong Kong is feeling a new and uncertain mood. **********''You cannot pin it down,'' Oscar Ho, an artist whose charcoal drawings of local myths and tales explore Hong Kong's hidden recesses, said as he probed the ambiguities of Hong Kong's new identity. **********''It's gradually happening,'' he said. ''People are getting more and more conservative. The first couple of months were O.K., but it's beginning to worry me now.'' **********Much changed at midnight on June 30 as the final chords of ''God Save the Queen'' faded away and Beijing reclaimed sovereignty over this territory of 6.4 million people. Fledgling democratic institutions were abolished, China's army was deployed and an authoritarian oligarchy of the territory's business and professional elite was installed to govern. **********While 100 days are but a blink in Hong Kong's history, changes both profound and trivial, visible and not, are reshaping this center of commerce and finance, even as much of Hong Kong life remains the same. **********Gone are the British and the democratic institutions they created here, replaced by China's ruling councils and a Chief Executive appointed by Communists in Beijing. **********Gone are the kilted soldiers of the Black Watch, the bagpipes and the Union Jack, supplanted by the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese flag. Gone are stamps with the Queen's portrait, English cooking at government functions and the sense that everything and anything was possible and permitted. **********The Chinese Army is here, but in virtual seclusion, living in the beige concrete pile still called the Prince of Wales Barracks. Queen's Road Central, still named that, continues to course with the well-dressed professionals in the banks, finance houses, development concerns and the many companies that have made this one of Asia's pre-eminent centers of business and investment. **********Political demonstrations, illegal in the rest of China, occur several times a week here. **********Tangible traces of British colonialism are steadily seeping away. The bright red cast-iron mailboxes emblazoned with the royal seal, some from the reign of Edward VII, have been replaced by austere green boxes. Tens of millions of coins with Queen Elizabeth's face, still legal tender, have vanished into the coffers of coin collectors. And Government House, where London's representative lived, is dark and abandoned. **********But the nature of Hong Kong's transformation, or indeed whether it has changed at all, is a matter of perspective. For many people, nothing has really changed, while for others this place has begun a transition to becoming just another Chinese city. **********For Tung Chee-hwa, 60, the shipping magnate selected by Beijing to run Hong Kong, ''it's business as usual in Hong Kong,'' a mantra he invokes repeatedly, here and during an official visit to Washington last month. **********Today, continuing the custom of British colonial governors, he presented his first state-of-the-territory address to Hong Kong. **********''Hong Kong's reunification with China,'' Mr. Tung told 60 Beijing-appointed legislators on this 100th day of Chinese rule, ''requires us to appreciate and accept one practical and profound truth: Hong Kong's prosperity and stability are closely linked with those of the mainland.'' **********And then, over the course of 125 minutes, Mr. Tung elaborated his agenda for governing Hong Kong, detailing a series of policies from building more housing to creating high-tech industrial parks, from new railroads to increasing welfare payments to the needy elderly by $1.65 a day. **********Reflecting the pre-eminence of big business in his administration, much of his address was devoted to how he intends to enhance the business climate and Hong Kong's waning regional competitiveness. **********Only in a line at the end of his speech did Mr. Tung set May 24 as the date for elections to the legislature. The election rules insure the dominance of business leaders, professionals and pro-China candidates. **********Mr. Tung has been fond of telling foreign audiences that the territory has remained unaltered by the resumption of Chinese rule. **********''There has been no change in the life style to which we are accustomed,'' Mr. Tung told the United States Chamber of Commerce during his Washington visit. ''And our economy continues to expand. It is deeply in China's interest that Hong Kong should continue to work well under the 'one country, two systems' concept,'' a reference to Beijing's formula for Hong Kong's semi-autonomy as a Chinese ''special administrative region.'' **********But Hong Kong's way of life is changing. Those changes are often neither drastic nor Draconian, but they are altering this territory in ways that are now and will increasingly be less international and more Chinese. **********Unlike his garrulous and outgoing predecessor, Chris Patten, Mr. Tung avoids local reporters, releases virtually no information about his weekly activities and in public rarely departs from stodgily written speeches. **********No change has been more immediate than the abolition of democratic institutions. **********On a frantically busy corner in the central business district the other day, Emily Lau, overwhelmingly elected to Hong Kong's legislature in 1995 but ousted by China on July 1, pleaded with the lunch-time rush of passers-by through a loudspeaker. **********''When the Chinese Government took over Hong Kong on July 1, all of us in the pro-democracy movement were thrown out of the legislative council,'' she said. ''I want to assure you we will continue to fight for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.'' **********Although she and 28 other proponents of universal suffrage lost their seats on July 1, these former lawmakers continue to speak out, to appear at public demonstrations against Mr. Tung's government and to raise money for severely limited legislative elections next year. **********''I don't think the Hong Kong people have much confidence in these elections,'' said Ms. Lau, who will be required to give up her British citizenship if she wants to run for the legislature. ''They know the rules are rigged. They know the government is not accountable. But we have to stop feeling helpless.'' **********Only those members of the territory's business elite who will be voted into the legislature by their companies are permitted to retain foreign passports. **********One of those who now sit in Hong Kong's appointed provisional legislative council, as it is known, is David Chu, a wealthy developer who gave up his United States passport in a public embrace China's rule of Hong Kong. **********''What has changed,'' he said. ''One word. Nothing. There is absolutely nothing going on.'' **********Yet even Mr. Chu, after some prodding, admitted that at least politically, the territory had regressed under Beijing's hand. **********''The political changes are a step back,'' he said. ''But nobody is saying it is a permanent step back. It's a temporary setback for democracy.'' **********When for the first time Hong Kong officially celebrated China's national day on Oct. 1, marking the day 48 years ago when Mao mounted the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Beijing and declared, ''The Chinese people have stood up,'' there was less a sense here of patriotic acclaim than of deep paradox. **********Nearly half of Hong Kong's people fled China for political or economic reasons since the Communist takeover on the mainland in 1949, and like all Hong Kongers they are now struggling to find a place in their new Chinese nation. **********In Fanling, a town in Hong Kong's New Territory, Polly Lee and Terence Cheng strolled down the street, glancing in closed store windows. **********''We don't feel any different,'' said Mr. Cheng, who said the couple were textile workers in their 20's, ''but that might change.'' **********This undercurrent of uncertainty over how Hong Kongers see themselves was reflected in an opinion poll released last week by the University of Hong Kong. **********Slightly more than 60 percent of those surveyed by the university said they were not proud of having become citizens of China, and only 17.5 percent actually regarded themselves as Chinese citizens. Nearly 40 percent defined themselves as ''Hong Kong citizens.'' **********''We are a city of Chinese people, but we've never been a Chinese city,'' said Margaret Ng, a lawyer and former legislator here. **********But moves, deliberate and not, are afoot to make this a Chinese city."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/03/business/philippine-economy-is-said-to-rise-6.5.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-01-03", "snippet": "Pres Fidel Ramos of Philippines says country's gross domestic product grew by 6.5 percent in 1996, fueled by economic reforms and political unity; economists are skeptical about Ramos's estimate (S)", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Philippine Economy Is Said to Rise 6.5%", "print_headline": "Philippine Economy Is Said to Rise 6.5%", "body_text": " **********The President of the Philippines, Fidel Ramos, said yesterday that the country's gross domestic product grew by about 6.5 percent last year, fueled by economic reforms and political unity.

Then, in May, in a dramatic late-night stunt, a group of radical secessionists scaled the bell tower in St. Mark's Square and unfurled the banner of La Serenissima Repubblica -- the Most Serene Republic -- as this watery city and its far-flung empire were known until two centuries ago. **********Venice is not a city that needs to attract attention, but flamboyant publicity like this would be a nightmare for any mayor, which is why it is probably a good thing that Venice's Mayor, Massimo Cacciari, is, by profession, a philosopher. **********Now 53, he will return to the study of theological philosophy when he steps down after the November mayoral elections. But as he gets ready to leave, Mr. Cacciari, who came to City Hall three years ago advocating greater local powers for Italy's cities and regions, is increasingly worried that Rome is taking too long to face up to the secessionist fevers in the Veneto region around Venice. **********''We need some real tangible proposals, otherwise the delirium of secession will only grow,'' said Mr. Cacciari, sitting in an office with high windows on the Grand Canal. ''A process has been set off in the Northeast and especially in the Veneto with the set of social dynamics which, if not met by a strong political response, will only continue to grow. If a snowball doesn't stop, it will become an avalanche.'' **********Federalism is on the agenda of an Italian parliamentary commission charged with producing a package of sweeping constitutional reforms this summer. But Mr. Cacciari and others feel that the commission has so far dealt with the issue of decentralization in a superficial manner, oblivious of the urgency that the Northern League -- the major secessionist party -- and various splinter groups have injected into the debate. **********The League, headed by Umberto Bossi, perhaps Italy's most volatile political figure, has shown no signs of gaining strength since 1996, when it won 10 percent of the national vote -- and as much as 40 percent in some regions of the Veneto. But Mr. Cacciari says that the League is now after more than mere votes. **********''The electoral question is not the one that is troubling, but rather the fact that the league has taken on an increasingly hostile and overbearing attitude,'' Mr. Cacciari said. ''They are becoming more intolerant, more bellicose.'' **********Even if the constitutional commission comes up with a federalist solution, these proposals must first be approved by Parliament and then by a national referendum before they go into effect. In the meantime, Italy is heading for another key test, as it struggles to meet the criteria for the European monetary union -- a verdict with wide implications for Mr. Bossi's movement. **********If Italy is left out of the first launch of the common European currency in 1999, the exclusion will give the Northern League more ammunition to argue that Italy's fortunes are being dragged down by an economically backward south, and a politically irresponsible Rome. For the small and medium-sized businesses whose exports have been behind the recent boom in the Veneto, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in Italy, exclusion from their customers' currency could be economically and psychologically crippling. **********''If Italy doesn't make it into the common currency, that is something Bossi will play off,'' said Francesco Jori, a political reporter for Il Gazzettino, a Venice newspaper. ''If that were to happen, the North would feel penalized as a result of the south, and there would be a real risk of a split.'' **********Venice, which has long regarded itself as the queen of Italian cities, has mainly stayed aloof from Mr. Bossi, whose style many here regard as vulgar and crude. In the 1996 national elections, the league won 22 percent of the votes here -- one of its lowest showings in the region. With its industrial base in its Mestre area, Venice has long been a bastion of the left; its historical center on the lagoon, which has seen its population drop from 150,000 to 70,000 in the last few decades, is more preoccupied with saving its soul from the invasion of mass tourism than with the theoretical question of independence. **********But for Mr. Cacciari, being Mayor of Venice for almost four years has only given him more proof of the stifling hand of what he calls the world's most centralized Government. ''From the organization of work to financial planning to public works, local administration is suffocated by the central bureaucracies,'' he said. **********But in reaching back to the past, to the days of the Serenissima, when Venice was a state unto itself, local historians argue that the secessionists are simply confusing their myths. **********''Within the myth is a total ignorance of history,'' said Prof. Gino Benzoni, of the Institute of the History of the Venetian State and Society. ''They invoke the myth of the Serenissima totally ignoring the contents of a history in which Venice, and its ruling nobility, dominated the Veneto region. But the myth has an anti-Rome function, and Bossi uses that myth to stir up and keep the anti-Rome sentiments boiling, and these sentiments are real.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/01/business/from-the-chief-accountant-a-farewell-ledger.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1997-06-01", "snippet": "Interview with Dennis R Beresford, retiring chairman of Financial Accounting Standards Board; photo; board's role in compelling companies to recognize cost of retiree benefits noted, as well as Congressional pressure that thwarted proposal to make...", "word_count": 3092, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "From the Chief Accountant, a Farewell Ledger", "print_headline": "From the Chief Accountant, a Farewell Ledger", "body_text": " **********DENNIS R. BERESFORD, who has been chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board for a turbulent decade, will step down at the end of this month. During his tenure, the board forced companies to begin recognizing the cost of post-retirement benefits while employees are still working. That angered many companies, but is now generally viewed as wise. **********But the board also underwent the embarrassment of issuing a standard for accounting for income taxes and then, in the face of widespread criticism, backing down and changing the standard. **********And perhaps most humiliating, the threat of Congressional action forced the board to retreat from a proposal to make companies treat the value of stock options handed out to employees as an expense. It settled for requiring companies to put in their footnotes to financial statements what the cost would have been had they treated it as an expense. **********As the 58-year-old Mr. Beresford leaves, the board is close to issuing a standard on derivatives that will make it easier for investors to see what companies are doing with these complex financial instruments, but that has also angered some companies that will be affected by it. **********It is not clear who will succeed him. A candidate needs the approval of the Financial Accounting Foundation, a group that includes many business representatives who are concerned about too-strict standards, and of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt Jr., who is determined that the F.A.S.B. remain independent of the businesses whose accounting it regulates. Finding an accountant whom all can accept is proving difficult. **********Mr. Beresford was national director of accounting standards for Ernst & Young before he joined the board, and will become a professor of accounting at the University of Georgia. In an interview in the board's offices, in Norwalk, Conn., he said he had failed in one of his main goals -- speeding up board action -- but he voiced pride in the board's accomplishments.   FLOYD NORRIS **********Q. After 10 years, are you sorry to leave? **********A. No. **********Q. Why not? **********A. I've enjoyed the time here very much, but I think it's healthy for the organization and healthy for me, as well, to have some amount of turnover. I'm happy to have served and am very happy to be leaving. **********Q. Do you think there's more business hostility to the F.A.S.B. than there used to be? **********A. I don't think so. When we were working on retiree health care, people said, ''Is this the most contentious issue you've ever dealt with?'' And certainly when we were dealing with stock options, that was the question. **********A few years ago we dealt with a very tiny issue. It said that if a mutual life insurance company wanted to say its reports were in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, they actually had to follow generally accepted accounting principles. And when we put that out for comment, you would have thought it was going to be the end of the world for mutual life insurance companies. They were up in arms and they were trying to lobby their friends in Congress and so forth. **********'Strategic Retreat' on Options **********Q. What about the stock options? You basically were blocked from changing the accounting for that by politics. **********A. That's one way of looking at it. The way I would phrase it is that we made a strategic retreat. It became obvious that if we had pursued the expense-recognition requirement there was a virtual certainty that we would have been overruled by either Congress or the S.E.C. **********Q. Was the S.E.C. not willing to support you? **********A. The S.E.C. never really made an absolute statement one way or the other, but it became clear that they were not going to be able to support us. And it might not have even been in their hands because the legislation was introduced and had enough support to overrule even an S.E.C. position. And the bad part was not just the particular issue in question -- the stock compensation issue -- but that the legislation would have provided a system whereby the S.E.C. would have had to explicitly review and concur with everything the board would do in the future. It basically would have emasculated the private sector standard-setting process. **********Frankly, the footnotes now provide the same information that would have been in the income statement. We didn't get all of what we had hoped for but we got most of it. It's going to be very interesting, now that companies have started reporting the new information, to see exactly how that's going to affect decisions by investors and creditors and others. **********There have been two issues in the history of the F.A.S.B. where it really came down to absolute interference with our best thinking through lobbying efforts and through governmental intervention. One was stock options. The other was the oil-and-gas issue back in the mid-1970's. Given the fact that we are not a governmental organization, that we need reasonable support from all of our constituents -- the business community, the accounting firms, the analysts, the regulators -- it seems to me that having to strategically retreat only twice in 24 years is a pretty darn good track record. **********Foundation Support **********Q. Mr. Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, criticized the Financial Accounting Foundation, the organization that chooses board members and arranges financing for your activities, for not backing the F.A.S.B. **********A. He was concerned that as a result of the efforts on the stock compensation project and what he perceived as perhaps some developing storm clouds on the derivatives project, there was a chance that the F.A.S.B. was going to lose support. And I think he viewed himself as part of the problem as well, that because he had not more strongly supported the F.A.S.B. on the stock compensation project, that could encourage others to make lobbying end runs and ultimately lead to more serious damage of the standard-setting process. **********Q. In the end, the S.E.C. forced the foundation to add more public trustees. Was that gain worth the pain of the fight? **********A. It got acrimonious during the time that it was going on and I think both the S.E.C. and the F.A.F. could have handled it better, including keeping it out of the newspaper. But I think it has created a situation that's a lot better for both the trustees themselves and for the F.A.S.B. I didn't think that we were not being supported by the trustees, but I think it has improved the situation a lot. That's probably the best thing that's happened to the F.A.S.B., at least institutionally, in the whole time I have been here. **********Q. You came from one of the major accounting firms, and before you joined the F.A.S.B., you were involved with advising the board. Critics say the Big Six are not speaking on behalf of what they think is best accounting but on behalf of what they think their customers want. **********A. Remember that it used to be that the accounting firms made generally accepted accounting principles through the Accounting Principles Board. It was judged in the early 1970's that that wasn't the best process and therefore it was turned over to a very independent private-sector group, namely the F.A.S.B. **********As a result, most of the participants in our process now feel that they should provide advice on their particular point of view and what is in their own particular interest. And then it should be up to us to make the difficult judgments. **********I provided some advice to the accounting firms on more than one occasion in speeches and articles, saying, ''I don't want you to think that you have to express a view on behalf of clients. I want you to say what you think is in your best interest.'' **********I'm concerned that too much of the time the accounting firms haven't told us when they think there's going to be a very significant audit issue associated with a new proposal. If they think something is just too fundamentally judgmental, for example, and wouldn't really result in sufficient reliability in financial reporting, I think they have a responsibility to say that. **********With respect to whether they are speaking for clients, there's probably more of that than in the past. But the reality is that there isn't a single view among their clients on most of these issues. Maybe the stock compensation project was one. But there's a vast array of comments on derivatives. Large, industrial-type corporations might have one view and large money-center banks might have a different view and smaller financial institutions might have still another view. **********There is more sensitivity among the accounting firms about what the clients think about their views. I am aware that, quite frequently, an audit client will ask the firm what its positions have been on F.A.S.B. proposals. **********Those Pesky Derivatives **********Q. Let's go back to derivatives for a moment. Are you sorry that you're not going to complete that project before you leave? **********A. Yes and no. I'd hoped that we would be able to finish the project because it is a very important one and I think that we're going to make great progress in the accounting in that area. But no in the sense that it shows that the system is not beholden to one individual, that it's absolutely imperative that we work through the issues and that we not try to meet some arbitrary deadline. We're going to finish it, in my opinion, early in the next fiscal year of the organization -- in September, something like that. **********Q. Some people say that one reason you've had so much trouble on the derivatives proposal is that you're working with an amalgam of two diametrically opposed accounting theories: one being that you should carry assets at historical cost, the other that you should carry them at fair market value. And such an amalgam cannot endure. **********A. The board shares that view. In the derivatives project we made it very clear that the board's vision, a longer-term objective, is that all financial instruments should be carried at fair value. That would eliminate a fair number of the problems associated with the derivatives issue. It wouldn't eliminate all of them by any means, though, because one of the primary questions about derivative financial instruments arises where you're hedging forecasted transactions that aren't even in your financial statements yet -- next year's sales or next year's costs or a purchase of a machine two years hence or the forecasted issuance of debt. **********Having a fair-market measure for all financial instruments would simplify things, but it also raises other complications, such as how do you determine the fair value of certain instruments? So I asked a team of board members and staff about a year ago to start working on a road map for the details of a project that will get us there. I believe in the next two to three years the board will be in a position to propose comprehensive fair-value accounting for financial instruments, and that will resolve a number of the issues. **********Q. One argument made is that the sheer level of opposition to some board proposals proves that your ideas are not generally accepted and therefore cannot be generally accepted accounting principles. **********A. If nothing else, it's a public relations problem for us. Basically, what generally accepted accounting principles means is whatever is required by the F.A.S.B. or other standard-setters. It might be, perhaps, more acceptable to some people if it were called something like generally required accounting principles. **********But some people say that unless at least half of the comment letters are in favor of something, then you shouldn't adopt it. Well, that simply isn't the way we see our responsibility. We see our responsibility as being leaders, and we recognize that we are likely to get more negative letters than positive letters on a lot of our projects because people who are in the opposition are more motivated to write to us. **********A pretty large percentage of our constituency simply wants to know what they're supposed to do and they'll follow the guidance that they're given as long as there's some reasonable consideration of the costs that they have to incur, and so forth. It's a relatively small number of people who fight us, but they're very vocal and well-organized and have a lot of resources. **********Q. Do you think there's a danger of having accounting standards be too specific and accountants become not professionals but merely functionaries? **********A. Yes, I think there is. In my opinion, it's a balancing act. It's very hard to get it right. There's virtually no standard that the F.A.S.B. has ever written that is free from judgment in its application. Lease accounting, for example, has a very specific test: If your minimum lease payments are equal to at least 90 percent of the fair value of the asset, then you have to capitalize; if it's 89 percent, you don't capitalize. But even there, there's judgment involved in estimating the fair value. And in many other cases -- my favorite example is loan losses -- there's no way a standard can be anything other than a broad amount of guidance that requires substantial professional judgment. **********Q. I've spoken to corporate financial officials who don't like many of the things you've done in recent years, who speak bitterly of what they view as a conspiracy between you folks and the Big Six to deprive accountants of judgment so that accountants will be protected if someone sues. **********A. There's certainly no conspiracy between the Big Six and us. The Big Six people really get very upset when people say that because they feel they're being punished for our sins. **********But the reality is that we do get requests for specificity from accounting firms -- the Big Six firms in particular, because they're more actively involved in our process than are some of the smaller firms. But we also get requests for specificity from corporations. Now, not every corporation, obviously, wants as much guidance as others. But at one recent meeting of our Emerging Issues Task Force, one of the corporate people in the public meeting said something like: ''I want to know exactly how I'm supposed to account for this particular transaction. I don't want any ambiguity whatsoever.'' **********High Points, Low Points **********Q. As you look back over your 10 years here, what are you most proud of? **********A. I think I'm most proud of the fact that we have endured and have such strong support from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Another thing is that the F.A.S.B. has adopted a strategic plan. It's a long way to go to get it all in place and fully functioning, but I'm proud of that. **********And I'm proud that we've done a lot in the international area. That's something that I take more personal pride in than almost anything else because I was the one who got us started. But the main sense of pride is that we have survived and that we are a very viable organization. **********Q. Michael Cook, the head of Deloitte & Touche and the chairman of the Financial Accounting Foundation, told me recently that he wasn't sure that there would be an F.A.S.B. in 10 years, because international standards might have taken over and rendered the F.A.S.B. obsolete. Do you agree? **********A. No. I believe the F.A.S.B. will continue as the standard-setter for U.S. corporations and as the leader for standard-setters throughout the world. In my opinion, there's no possibility that the F.A.S.B. will not be here in 10 years' time. **********Q. What have been the biggest disappointments of your tenure? **********A. Probably that things still move very slowly. When I came to the board, I said that that's something I'd like to improve. It hasn't happened. We have adopted some new ideas as part of our strategic plan and we are at least going to be a lot more careful in trying to plan out our work. **********For example, we have made a commitment that we will not take on a project unless we firmly believe that we can finish it within no more than three years. But that's more of a philosophy as opposed to an actual accomplishment at this point. **********I guess I'm more of a realist now that I recognize that it's complicated -- that there are outside forces that don't want us to move as quickly as we should, for example. All of the due process that we follow is important and if we didn't have the challenge to our proposals, we wouldn't be issuing the highest quality standards. **********The biggest amount of time, though, is spent on getting agreement on the board. We have seven very strong intellects. **********Q. Are there any accounting standards that you think you didn't handle very well? **********A. Well, we certainly didn't handle the accounting for income taxes project very well. We issued a final standard and then had to go back and revise it substantially just a couple of years later. The first one was almost hopelessly complicated, and it didn't come up with reasonable answers in some cases. That was a bit of an embarrassment.  But I think it also showed that the board was not afraid to admit a mistake. **********We try very hard on our projects to learn both the good and the bad things that have occurred and then apply them on other projects. But it doesn't always work. We thought we had learned a lot on the retiree health care issue, that having early communications and going out and trying to sell our ideas and understand different points of view helped a lot in making our final standard much more acceptable. When we tried to apply some of those same techniques in the stock-options project, it didn't work. **********Seeking a Successor **********Q. They seem to be having some trouble finding your successor. What characteristics are most important for the job? **********A. You really have to believe in the importance of this activity. It sounds a little corny,  but it's really more of a calling than an assignment. Once you get here, there's an awful lot of negativity associated with the position. And unless you are firmly a believer, it could get you down fairly quickly. **********A lot of people answer in a cliche, saying we have to have a real thick skin. I don't think that's really quite right. I like to say you have to have a medium skin because if you have a thin skin, the criticism will get to you and you won't be able to handle the position; if you have too thick a skin, it will appear, at least, that you're oblivious to reasonable criticism. **********Q.

Fujimori was riding high on a wave of popularity driven by the daring rescue of hostages held by leftist guerrillas at the Japanese diplomatic residence here. **********Peruvians and foreign governments had nothing but praise for Mr. Fujimori for carrying out the raid with so few casualties among the hostages and rescuers -- a feat he called a ''victory for democracy.'' **********But now, after a string of blatant attacks against the judiciary, the press and critics, Mr. Fujimori has few supporters. His approval rating is at a low point, five members of his Cabinet have resigned and thousands of people are protesting in the streets. **********Reveling in the success of the hostage raid, Mr. Fujimori's Government has undertaken a repressive campaign in recent weeks to remove any obstacle to his winning an unparalleled third term. **********His administration engineered the dismissal of three Supreme Court justices who ruled that it was unconstitutional for Mr. Fujimori to run for President again. It also tapped the telephones of prominent citizens and journalists, and tried to shut down the television station that exposed the illegal wiretaps. **********While Mr. Fujimori's critics predicted that he would use the hostage rescue to advance his political agenda, almost no one expected him to go to such extremes, which have led many people here to conclude that the President has lost control of the Government to Peru's notorious intelligence service and armed forces that have long been the foundation of his rule. **********Analysts have long described Mr. Fujimori's Government as a tripod in which the President shares power with the heads of the military and the intelligence service. But the moves undertaken by the administration in recent weeks have convinced many analysts that Mr. Fujimori has lost the upper hand. **********''This is the beginning of the end for Fujimori and the dictatorial way he has ruled Peru,'' said Javier Diez Canseco, an opposition Congressman. ''Fujimori either has to break ranks with the generals and advisers that are behind his repressive regime, or they will break him. There is too much public outrage for things to continue as they have.'' **********In recent days, thousands of union workers, professionals and students, waving banners and chanting anti-Fujimori slogans, have filled the plazas and streets of Lima in the largest demonstrations against the Government's policies since Mr. Fujimori took office in 1990. **********''A few weeks ago I would have been afraid to march against the Government, because people who protest are often killed and tortured,'' said Jorge Marina, a teacher who demonstrated last week in front of the Presidential Palace. ''But Fujimori has gone too far this time. There is no democracy left. There is no hope for our children.'' **********Even many of Mr. Fujimori's close friends and allies, including Cabinet members, foreign diplomats and members of Congress, have expressed concern about the latest direction of his Government. **********Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela said he had resigned along with four other ministers as ''a matter of conscience.'' **********A public opinion survey released here today by Imasen, a leading polling firm, found that 19 percent of 400 people questioned in Lima last week approved of Mr. Fujimori's Government, compared with 39.5 percent in May and 77 percent after the hostage rescue in April. It was the lowest popularity level for Mr. Fujimori in his seven years of power. No margin of sampling error was given for the poll. **********Giovana Penaflor, Imasen's director, attributed Mr. Fujimori's plummeting popularity to ''the fact that he has not provided the country with a clear and direct explanation of these scandals and he has not convinced people that as head of state, he is the one who is running Peru.'' **********What has apparently angered Peruvians the most was the Government's decision last week to revoke the citizenship of the owner of the television station that uncovered a scheme by the national intelligence agency to secretly record the telephone conversations of dozens of politicians, business executives and journalists. The telephones monitored included a cellular phone of The New York Times in Peru. **********Because Peruvian law requires investors in national television stations to be citizens, the majority shareholder and administrator of the station that broadcast the wiretapping report, Baruch Ivcher, could be required to sell his stake. He has filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Government's action. **********''The absolutely stupid mistake of stripping Ivcher of his citizenship has created an environment of political and economic instability,'' said Alejandro Toledo, a well-known economist and former presidential candidate. ''This Government had been walking on three big legs, but now one leg is shorter than the other two, and that's why President Fujimori can't make the changes that necessary to return democracy to Peru.'' **********Political analysts here said that Peruvians are especially troubled by Mr. Fujimori's refusal to remove two officials who are believed to be the architects of the wire-tapping scandal and the driving force behind the administration's dictatorial style. **********They are Vladimiro Montesinos, the de facto head of the intelligence service, who rarely appears in public but is one of the President's closest advisers, and Gen. Nicolas Hermoza, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, who backed Mr. Fujimori when he assumed near-dictatorial powers in 1992. **********As in other crises, Mr. Fujimori has remained largely secluded in the Presidential Palace, where he held a brief news conference last week in which he denied that his Government had conducted illegal wiretaps and sought to assure Peruvians that he was still in command. **********At the news conference, General Hermoza said, ''We want to emphatically express our subordination, loyalty and disciplined support.'' But many Peruvians recalled numerous incidents in recent years when the military openly defied Mr. Fujimori's orders. **********For example, despite an executive order from Mr. Fujimori, army officials refused to release a retired general whom they had jailed after he publicly disclosed cases of torture and murder within the military and intelligence service. **********So far the crisis has had little impact on Peruvian financial markets or on the flow of foreign investments. But local business leaders and foreign investors have expressed concern over the Government's recent actions, particularly the move against Mr. Ivcher. **********''Obviously a crisis of this nature makes investors nervous, but so far we believe Peru's economic fundamentals will remain intact as it goes through this transition from an authoritarian government,'' said Juan Carlos Garcia, head of Latin American equity research for Santander Investment Research, an investment bank. **********''In many ways this crisis is healthy,'' Mr. Garcia said, ''because it sets the stage for thinking about who comes next after Fujimori. He cannot stay in power forever.'' **********Mr. Fujimori, who was elected to a second four-year term in 1995, has said he wants to run again in 1999. Last year, he persuaded Congress, which is controlled by his political party, to pass a legal interpretation declaring that his second term counted as his first."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/03/business/gasoline-prices-rise-sharply-as-refinery-unit-stays-shut.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-09-03", "snippet": "Gasoline prices surge on New York Mercantile Exchange after Exxon Corp says a unit at Texas refinery is still closed, meaning another week of reduced supplies (M)", "word_count": 348, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gasoline Prices Rise Sharply As Refinery Unit Stays Shut", "print_headline": "Gasoline Prices Rise Sharply As Refinery Unit Stays Shut", "body_text": " **********Gasoline prices surged on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday after the Exxon Corporation said a unit at a Texas refinery was still closed, meaning another week of reduced supplies. **********Natural gas prices also rose sharply.

But he said it was likely that the Fed would wait for real price increases to reach the consumer level before acting on interest rates. **********''It is clear that today's P.P.I. report should permit the Fed to remain on hold even in March, when they next meet,'' he said. ''Consequently, what the report really suggested to most market investors is that the central bank is unlikely to rock the boat until at least the end of the first half of the year at the earliest.'' **********The next most important piece of market-friendly data after the P.P.I., he said, is industrial production in January. ''Everyone knew that overall manufacturing employment only rose modestly while manufacturing employment and overtime hours sharply declined, thereby pointing in the direction of moderate industrial production growth,'' Mr. Chan said. Total industrial production was flat in January. **********Yesterday's economic reports  strongly suggest that the economy is definitely slowing down from its strong growth pace in the fourth quarter of 1996. It gave bond investors a big enough comfort zone to buy securities without fear that the Fed would suddenly raise interest rates.

But on the Continent, too, companies have started to merge into larger units, trim management and concentrate on the activities they do best. **********The popular image of a soaring America eclipsing a waning Europe was always exaggerated. Europe has world-class companies, for instance, in autos, food, oil, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, banking and insurance. **********But restructuring in Europe has been more cautious and less visible than in the United States. Much of the reorganization undertaken by large European companies has been internal, escaping general notice. **********The more ostentatious attempts \u2014 like Renault's recent controversial plan to close a plant in Belgium and Krupp Hoesch AG's failed takeover bid for Thyssen AG in Germany \u2014 illustrate the difficulties Europe faces in consolidating its industry. **********Europe certainly still has far to go in many ways to match the drive of the United States and emerging countries in Asia. Labor unions, governments and the European Commission did their best to thwart Renault in Belgium, and Krupp failed to overcome Germany's traditional dislike of hostile takeovers. **********But the other, less obvious message of Renault's Belgian debacle is that the European auto industry is finally trying to grapple with overcapacity. And although Krupp's bid for Thyssen failed, the two companies did agree to merge their steel interests in a much-needed rationalization. **********Across the Continent, government telecommunications monopolies are beginning to shake themselves free of the past, and many companies are making better use of technology and increasing productivity \u2014 one factor contributing to high unemployment. **********That is Europe's real problem: Its efforts to restructure are not creating jobs. Europe, for instance, lags badly in information and communications technology, which generates many of the best new jobs in America. **********The move of European workers from manufacturing to services is still too slow, especially in Germany, and some service sectors, such as airlines, telecommunications and finance, are \"crying out for rationalization,\" according to Mark Howdle of UBS Ltd. **********Some restructuring reaches across borders, like the merger planned by France's Lyonnaise des Eaux SA and Compagnie de Suez SA, which includes Belgian interests. But most mergers are still inside national boundaries. **********France is fostering economic nationalism and inefficiency by rejecting a bid from Britain's General Electric Co. for the French defense company Thomson-CSF. Nationalism helped fuel the outcry against Renault in Belgium. **********Although competition, especially from Japan, sparked America's restructuring, European companies are still too often shielded by protectionist regulations and practices. **********Business confidence is sapped by uncertainty over the future of European unity, and although the European Union's single market has helped tear down barriers to the movement of people and goods, many still remain. **********A single currency should intensify intra-European competition, training European companies to become global performers. The currency's launch, says John Llewellyn of Lehman Brothers in London, can be expected to herald a new wave of European investment and rationalization. **********Europe is unlikely ever to react with the speed of America \u2014 its culture and its people's expectations are different.

But chief executives still had an average total compensation of $1,026,900, according to an annual study conducted  by Buck Consultants, a human resources firm in New York, which surveyed the compensation levels in effect on April 1 this year. **********''With mutual fund companies coming off back-to-back strong years, bonuses paid to C.E.O.'s this year mirrored what they received last year,'' said Paul Gavejian, a principal and compensation consultant in Buck's office in Stamford, Conn. **********Some people in the industry, however, received much larger increases. Heads of fixed-income investing, for example, received a 25.4 percent increase in total compensation, to an average of $652,900, and the average compensation for chief administrative officers jumped 23 percent, to $225,700. **********And some fund executives saw their compensation decline sharply.  Total compensation for taxable-bond chiefs fell 37 percent, to an average of $540,200. Heads of tax-exempt securities investments earned $375,900, on average, a decline of 15.5 percent. **********The survey, based on responses from 51 fund companies, looked at total compensation levels for more than 100 positions, as well as at compensation practices and policies. **********New Funds **********Compass Capital International Small Cap Equity will use a value approach to picking stocks with market capitalizations of $100 million to $1 billion in developed and emerging markets.

About two dozen Palestinians were treated for various injuries. **********In Bethlehem, protesters burned American and Israeli flags but were restrained from rock-throwing by Palestinian police. **********Ramallah was the place where similar disorders last September, touched off by Israel's opening of a tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem, suddenly turned murderous as the two sides began swapping gunfire. The fighting spread through the West Bank and Gaza Strip and left more than 70 dead. **********After that violence, the special American envoy to the Middle East, Dennis Ross, spent long weeks brokering an Israeli withdrawal from Hebron, which was finally completed in January and was supposed to have ushered in a more stable relationship between Mr. Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. **********But the partnership soon disintegrated after Israel began building a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem and announced a redeployment in the West Bank that the Palestinians found insultingly small. Mr. Arafat severed the negotiations, and once the bulldozers began work on the neighborhood, Har Homa, Palestinian youths took to the streets. **********Beginning his latest Middle East trip today, Mr. Ross flew first to Morocco to meet with Mr. Arafat and was expected in Israel late Thursday. **********American officials said he would be seeking a clear declaration from Mr. Arafat that he is against the use of terror and violence, in the wake of Israeli charges that he gave a ''green light'' to Islamic militants to mount terror attacks against Israel. A suicide bombing in Tel Aviv last Friday killed three Israeli women. **********From Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Ross is expected to seek some actions to allay the anger roused by the recent Israeli decisions. **********Officials said that Mr. Ross was not bringing any specific proposal and that his main mission was to consult with the squabbling sides on how to break the deadlock in negotiations. He is to return by the weekend to report to President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. **********One idea that the Americans are reported to be interested in is Mr. Netanyahu's proposal to set aside the existing ''interim'' agreement, which envisions more partial withdrawals while a final settlement is being negotiated, and jump directly to accelerated ''final status'' talks, with a six-month deadline for reaching agreement. **********Mr. Netanyahu raised the plan with King Hussein of Jordan last week, but the Palestinians dismissed it as an attempt to elude obligations under existing agreements. **********In the American view, the attempt to maintain the existing schedule has only led to confrontations in the last eight months and no further action is required by Israel for another six months in any event, so nothing would be lost in starting intensive talks. In any event, negotiations on a final settlement were originally supposed to have begun last week. **********Mr. Ross's return coincided with growing indications in Israel that Mr. Netanyahu was considering taking his Likud Party into a ''national unity'' government with the rival Labor Party and its leader, Shimon Peres. **********After eight months of incessant crises with the Palestinians and with his contentious coalition of rightist and religious parties, Mr. Netanyahu is thought to be seriously tempted by the notion of a coalition. It would give him more flexibility and credibility in negotiations with the Palestinians, and would protect him against the constant threat of being brought down by a no-confidence vote in Parliament. **********Both of the actions that led to the current crisis, the proposed Jewish housing project and the small West Bank withdrawal, were effectively dictated by threats from right-wing Cabinet members to bring down the Government. **********Israel has had national unity governments before, most recently a Labor-Likud coalition from 1984 to 1988 in which Mr. Peres and Yitzhak Shamir of the Likud took turns serving as Prime Minister. **********But if such a coalition is formed now, Mr. Netanyahu would remain Prime Minister, since he was directly elected by the country's voters rather than by Parliament. The change would be in the makeup of the Cabinet, where Labor would probably demand an equal number of portfolios to Likud. **********Mr. Peres has made no secret of his interest in joining a coalition, since it is effectively his last chance to serve in the Israeli Government. He has announced that he will not run for re-election as party leader in the Labor election scheduled for June 3, when the leadership is expected to pass to Ehud Barak, a former army Chief of Staff and Defense Minister. **********For Mr. Peres, a seat on the Cabinet could also give him an opportunity to revive the peace agreements of which he was the premier architect. By all accounts, his joining the Government would be predicated on a firm understanding about the direction of Israeli-Palestinian progress. **********Though talk of a national unity government has been in the air for months, it gained intensity after Mr. Peres met recently with Mr. Netanyahu. Israeli officials said President Ezer Weizman was also actively involved in promoting such a coalition and the Americans looked favorably on it. **********Mr. Netanyahu has formally denied any such plans. After the daily Yediot Ahronot published what it said was a lineup of a new national unity cabinet, Mr. Netanyahu's office issued a statement saying: ''The Prime Minister has not decided to form a national unity government, and any talk about its makeup, size and other details is journalistic speculation.'' **********And any move by the Labor Party depends on the outcome of a police investigation into influence-peddling in Mr. Netanyahu's Government. The findings are expected any day. **********But it is no secret that Mr. Netanyahu has welcomed the speculation as a means of keeping his present unruly coalition in line. Mr. Netanyahu would also presumably prefer a unity government with Mr. Peres, who poses no future political threat, than with Mr. Barak, who is likely to be his challenger in the next national election. **********But Mr. Barak would have to receive a senior ministry, probably Defense, to agree to a merger. That speculation has raised the hackles of Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who has threatened to quit if Mr. Netanyahu tries to shift him to another post."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/15/business/accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Levere", "pub_date": "1997-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 33, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Seagate Software, Vancouver, a subsidiary of Seagate Technologies, to DDB Interactive, Dallas, a unit of Omnicom Group, as the first agency to handle its interactive marketing.

Various courts have ruled that neither the Federal nor state constitutions provide privacy protection regarding E-mail in the workplace, and only a few states have passed laws that specifically protect employees' E-mail messages. In general, office E-mail is no more protected than employees' telephones, which are fair game, given proper warning by the employer. **********In fact, many corporate policies warn employees that E-mail is about as private as making a personal call over a speaker phone in a crowded office. At employee orientations at Kmart, new workers are told that personal use of E-mail could result in dismissal. **********And many employers haven't shied away from exercising their right to examine workers' E-mail. While statistics differ, various surveys agree that more than a third of corporations regularly monitor their employees electronically, which generally includes E-mail spot-checks. (The actual number may be higher because not all executives are likely to be candid when questioned about surveillance practices.) **********Recently, large companies have also used new software, like Assentor or Spyglass Surfwatch, that allows them to screen large numbers of messages without actually reading them. The software detects certain key words that hint at behavior the company is seeking to control, then retrieves those messages for perusal. **********Aside from exercising what they consider their legal right, corporations rationalize eavesdropping on other grounds. Surveillance, they argue, is needed to insure that productivity is maintained, that trade secrets are kept, that crimes are not committed on their premises and that employees do not use E-mail to harass one another. **********(In a case that was dismissed last summer in Federal court, Morgan Stanley was sued by black employees who contended  that a hostile environment existed at the firm because a racist message was sent on the E-mail system. Chevron agreed to a settlement with four female employees who contended that sexist jokes, circulated via the company's computer system, were part of a pattern of sexual harassment.) **********EMPLOYEES do have some recourse if their corporations have granted certain privacy rights. But few companies have done so, and even then their workers must be willing to take their cases to court. Corporations, however, would be well advised to grant employees a measure of privacy. After all, companies are not merely places of employment; they are something of a community, too. ''On the job'' is where many employees form much of their social network, where they make friends and develop loyalties. **********In the 1980's, corporations were so worried about competing that they paid little attention to things like communal feelings or their employees' commitment to the workplace. But many companies have recently recognized that their streamlining has gone too far -- that impersonal efficiency is often penny-wise but pound-foolish, that corporate interests may be better served by a happier labor force. Indicators of this progression include so-called dress-down days,  corporate retreats and enhanced parental leave. **********Popular fears about privacy violations, real or imagined, offer a particularly inviting opportunity for corporations to show support for workplace community. A granting of privacy rights at work can demonstrate this concern, especially if it comes as a gesture of genuine trust rather than a step required by law. **********The details matter less than the sentiment behind them, but some options come readily to mind. Employers, for example, could provide employees with a bloc of expressly private E-mail terminals -- perhaps equipped with encryption software. Or companies could stipulate that messages preceded by a code word -- or all messages sent to an employee's home -- will not be screened unless there is evidence from some other source that a crime has been committed or that a corporate policy has  been violated. The employer might even declare a maximum number of private messages. **********Other avenues may well be found, but  companies first need to accept a basic point: that even if they aren't required to provide their employees with E-mail privacy, it would be more communitarian, and possibly profitable, to do so."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/21/world/historic-prison-site-is-a-bit-punishing-to-tourists.html": {"writer_name": "Suzanne Daley", "pub_date": "1997-01-21", "snippet": "South Afridan prison at Robben Island is now visited by tourists who line up to see small cell where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years; photo; map; local charter boat captains, who have been taking tourists on luxury cruises around island...", "word_count": 1108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Historic Prison Site Is a Bit Punishing to Tourists", "print_headline": "Historic Prison Site Is a Bit Punishing to Tourists", "body_text": " **********On the boat over, Nonga Ndabankulu teased his children about their expectations.

He said that was only because such big things had happened here. **********But now, in the grim passageway outside the cell where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for more than 18 years, they could only stare. **********''It is so small,'' Mr. Ndabankulu said finally. ''As tall as he is, it means he never was able to stretch. I think the old man was very strong to survive this. It was very cruel.'' **********Since the island opened to tourists on Jan. 1, thousands have lined up to see the place that Mr. Mandela, who is now the President, once called ''the harshest, most iron-fisted outpost in the South African penal system.'' **********Some have stood outside the cell and cried. Almost always there is total silence as gaily dressed tourists, hauling children and video cameras, contemplate what life must have been like here. **********But if the final destination, a one-story stone barracks surrounded by rusting razor wire, has become a shrine, the pilgrim's path to it is across troubled waters. **********A fight has broken out between local charter boat captains and the Government over who has the right to carry tourists from the jaunty Victoria and Alfred wharf -- a slick collection of malls and museums that is one of Cape Town's premier tourist destinations -- to the cell where Mr. Mandela became a legend. **********The charter owners, who have been taking tourists on luxury cruises around the island for years and expected to be allowed to land passengers here when it opened, say the Government's decision to run its own ferries and keep exclusive landing rights is eviscerating their business. Overnight, they said, they lost half of their business, and they are consulting lawyers. **********On Jan. 4, defying the Government, they took more than 200 tourists to the island and allowed them to go ashore. The Government responded by blockading the prison entrance. **********''We can't compete,'' said Bruce See, the head of Boat Owners and Charter Association. ''Looking at it from a boat isn't enough if there is the possibility of going on the island.'' **********Mr. See says the competition is unfair, especially from a Government whose policy is to privatize state assets. **********But the new temporary administrator of the island, Andre Odendaal, says the battle is about the charter boat captains' ''old South African arrogance.'' **********He wants to make sure that nonwhites can profit from a state asset. ''There is no way we can allow people like that to barge in,'' he said, referring to the charter boat captains. ''They have no black ownership, no black crews. They are a monopoly in their own right.'' **********Right now, the Government's $16 boat and bus tour is not exactly fun. **********There are not enough seats on the ferry's hard benches, so many passengers stand or lean. Full boats inexplicably idle at the dock in the blistering sun while the passengers watch comfortable charter boats whiz off, half empty. **********And just when passengers begin muttering about being overcome by the boat's diesel fumes, the captain points out that they are having an authentic experience. The ferry, named the Diaz after the Portuguese explorer Bartholemew Diaz, used to carry prisoners to the island. **********The rickety buses on the other side do not offer much comfort either. They have no air-conditioning, and most of their windows are stuck shut. To maintain what Mr. Odendaal calls the ''sensitive ecological balance of the island,'' which is home to gazelles, ostriches and thousands of penguins, passengers are not allowed off during the hourlong ride except at the prison. They are instructed not to  pick up even a pebble as a souvenir. **********''You just can't have hundreds of people runing around wherever they want,'' Mr. Odendaal said. ''You could do real damage.'' **********Mr. Odendaal says everything about the tours will be reconsidered in April, when the tourist season is over. For now, they are all the Ministry of Arts and Culture could come up with in the four months since Parliament decided to make the island a monument. **********The decision ended years of speculation about its fate since the last political prisoners were removed from the island in 1991. More than 200 proposals were made, including ones for a casino and a vast resort. **********Given Robben Island's history, almost nothing seems absurd. It was, at various times, home to a leper colony, an insane asylum and an army base. It was used as a prison as far back as the 1600's. But in the 1960's a special compound was built for nonwhite political prisoners. It was a place intended to punish, without even a pretense of rehabilitation. **********In weather that ranged from scorching hot to piercing cold, they were forced to break rocks in lime quarries. Food and clothing were rationed according to race: ''Coloreds,'' or people of mixed race, could wear long pants and eat bread with supper; ''Africans'' wore shorts and got less meat and no bread. Assaults were frequent. Beaten prisoners were forced to clean their own blood-spattered cells. **********The tour is led by former prisoners. Some, like Bongani Jonas, are working here temporarily. A former guerrilla in Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of Mr. Mandela's African National Congress, he is now a colonel in the South African Army. **********But others like Patrick Matanjane, who spent 20 years on the island, hope for a permanent job. Some forner Robben Island prisoners are now in the Cabinet. But at a reunion last year, it was clear that hundreds of others are barely scraping by. **********Mr. Matanjane said that when he first returned to the island he cried. But nowadays he finds it very beautiful. **********The guides do their best to explain the harshness of life here. How it took years for the prisoners to win the right to more than one letter every six months and even then, the censors often cut the letters to shreds. How important prisoners like Mr. Mandela often spent 14 hours a day in isolation cells with only buckets for toilets, and often sick from the miserable food. How cold sea water showers gave many men rashes. How everyone slept on grass mats with a single blanket. **********Except for a cot and a wooden table in Mr. Mandela's cell, the prison has been stripped clean, without so much as a poster on its pale gray walls. No sodas or souvenirs are hawked anywhere. **********Some of the tourists grumbled. Others thought it appropriate. **********''It sure isn't a comfortable or fancy tour,'' said Cecil Triegaardt, a communication consultant. ''And there isn't a lot to see, either. But that's not really what it's about, is it? It's something you do because you need to.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/24/business/10-years-after-lessons-of-an-earlier-market-peak.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1997-08-24", "snippet": "Outlook for stock prices discussed in light of parallels between current market exuberance and bull market that preceded Oct 1987 stock market crash; review of developments that led to crash makes it obvious that United States economy is in much s...", "word_count": 3552, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Chronology", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "10 Years After, Lessons of an Earlier Market Peak", "print_headline": "10 Years After, Lessons of an Earlier Market Peak", "body_text": " **********IT was a glorious summer on Wall Street. Stock prices rocketed to a series of new highs as investors poured record amounts of money into mutual funds. The last recession was a distant memory, and, although interest rates were perking up a bit, inflation appeared under control. With Labor Day approaching, few saw any reason for the market run-up to end anytime soon. **********Sound familiar? The description fits today, but the same events transpired in the summer of 1987, at the end of one of the greatest bull runs in Wall Street history. On Aug. 25, 1987 -- 10 years ago tomorrow -- the Dow Jones industrial average peaked at 2,722.42, culminating a spectacular advance of more than 40 percent in just eight months. **********Who on Wall Street that day could have known that less than two months later, those gains would evaporate in a frenzy of selling, the memory of which still produces knots in the stomachs of many market longtimers? **********To some who lived through it, the crash of Oct. 19, 1987 -- when the market plummeted 22.6 percent in a single session, a percentage decline nearly twice as large as the 1929 debacle that ushered in the Great Depression and more than seven times the 3.1 percent plunge that rattled Wall Street nine days ago -- seemed like a bolt from the blue. **********But even as the first crocus poked its head out of the still-thawing ground that spring, signs of trouble were sprouting on the economic landscape. By late August, they were everywhere, and a few nervous investors were beginning to sniff a disaster. Before the market opened on that Black Monday in October, stock prices had already fallen more than 17 percent from their peak. **********With the parallels between the market exuberance of 1987 and 1997 so stark, the question naturally arises: Are there also parallels between economic conditions then and now that forebode another market meltdown? **********A review of the developments that led to Black Monday makes it obvious that the United States economy is in much sounder shape now than it was then. **********In addition, policy makers have clearly learned the lessons of that era and are not likely to make the same mistakes. **********But the same historical retrospective shows that even as events that bring down a market unfold, their capacity for damage often goes unrecognized. And that raises a troubling question for investors in 1997: Now that the economic generals know how to fight the last war, will they recognize the warning signs of the next one? **********So many economic and political episodes -- from the recent currency crisis in Southeast Asia to last month's balanced-budget accord in the United States -- hold the potential for disruptive consequences that even the savviest policy maker cannot know exactly how to respond to them. And market downturns have a habit of catching people by surprise. Indeed, the big guessing game on Wall Street these days is whether a correction or worse is under way at this very moment. **********That said, many analysts are much more comfortable with the resilience of the American economy today than they were a decade ago. ''From my perspective, 1997 and 1987 are very dissimilar,'' said Wayne D. Angell, a Bear, Stearns economist who 10 years ago was a member of the Federal Reserve Board. ''At that time, you had a deterioration of the economic policy environment, which meant stocks were not going to work as the market had priced them. **********''The economic condition was worsening from October 1986 through October 1987,'' he added. Today, by contrast, it is not. ''My major responsibility is to blow the whistle of alarm if economic policy starts to deteriorate,'' Mr. Angell said. ''I do not see any signs of that occurring. I continue to expect that the bull market goes on and on and on, interrupted only by some corrections.'' **********Letting the Good Times Roll **********Probably the most striking similarity between 1987 and today is the investor euphoria that in both periods helped fuel the market to ever loftier peaks -- peaks that, then as now, economic killjoys were warning were unrealistic by traditional measures. The good times, it seemed, would never end. **********''I would say that things today are maybe 70 percent similar to 1987'' in that regard, said Robert Farrell, a senior investment adviser at Merrill Lynch who in 1987 was the firm's chief market strategist. ''On an economic basis, the two periods are different. But we have a period of overvaluations, with high public participation in the market and a high level of complacency in bullish sentiment.'' **********For example, Mr. Farrell recalls, analysts considered the market to be highly valued in March 1987 -- and it shot up another 20 percent over the next five months as $3 billion a month flowed into mutual funds, foreigners scrambled to invest in American stocks and the total supply of stock shrank from all the leveraged buyouts and other deals that were taking place. **********Market players who recount their astonishment at the 1987 gainssound remarkably like people today marveling over the Dow's climb from one millennial post to the next. **********Barton M. Biggs, chairman of asset management at Morgan Stanley, spent part of August 1987 climbing Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa. **********''I had been out of touch for a week, and when I came back down from the mountain I got a copy of The International Herald Tribune,'' Mr. Biggs recalled. ''I remember looking at the prices of stocks and just being stunned by the gains that had occurred in just a week.'' **********Peter Lynch, then the manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund, the country's largest mutual fund, also spent a lot of his time shaking his head in wonder. **********''What sticks in my head is that in the four years from August 1982 to September 1986, the Dow went up 1,000 points,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''In the next 11 months, it went up another 1,000 points. That's an unbelievable acceleration.'' **********Like many investors in 1987, though, Mr. Lynch saw no reason to fear a market crash. Indeed, he went on a mid-October trip to Ireland, the first vacation he had taken since the beginning of the bull market in 1982. **********He acknowledges having some misgivings as the market headed lower in early October, but, he said, ''I'm not going to cancel what was to be my first vacation in five years, based on something that might never happen.'' **********Of course, historical analogies are never exact, and the mood of the 80's differed in some important ways from today's. **********In contrast to the more circumspect 1990's, investors and corporations had a weakness back then for extravagant borrowing and flamboyant gestures like the Digital Equipment Corporation's decision to have a $20 million party aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 in Boston Harbor to announce a new product offering. **********Even so, Mr. Biggs said, investors were probably a bit more squeamish 10 years ago than they are now. **********''I see much the same environment today that I saw in 1987 as far as the momentum of the market, and the enthusiasm in stocks that are going up, making their own magic,'' he said. ''But I think there was less exuberance then than there is today. Any time you get a market making a big move, people tend to ignore valuation measures. And there's always the argument that it is different this time and this is a new era. But in 1987, I don't think people were making that argument to the same extent that they are now.'' **********Mr. Farrell of Merrill Lynch agrees about the climate of a decade ago. **********''Nobody was talking about the economy being in a sweet spot, with just enough strength and no inflation,'' he said. ''At that time, people were concerned about the economy. And while there were people talking about a new era, that was not as prevalent as it is today.'' **********But if the mood was ebullient back then, the forces driving the economies of 1987 and 1997 were pushing in very different directions. **********The Clouds Gather **********Then, as now, the most potent force was the cost of credit. The higher the interest rates people and businesses must pay for loans, the heavier the drag on the economy; the lower the interest rates, the more powerful the impetus. **********For those who were asked to compare the two eras, one of the sharpest discrepancies was the sudden uptick in interest rates in the summer of 1987, even without any explicit action by the Federal Reserve Board. **********That reversed what had been an extended period of rate declines that unwound the high interest rates engineered in the early 1980's by the Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, to squelch rampant inflation. **********From January through July 1986, the Fed made three cuts in the discount rate, the rate at which member banks borrow money from the Fed. As short-term rates fell, so did Long-term rates, to about 7.5 percent from 10.5 percent a year earlier. As rates came down, so did commodity prices; in July 1986, at the time of the third rate cut, the price of a barrel of crude oil stood at $9.74. **********In August 1986, the Fed took a final step to cut short-term borrowing costs, trimming half a percentage point from the discount rate, to 5.5 percent. Mr. Angell, the former Fed board member, now says that was a mistake. ''Paul Volcker and I both agreed afterwards that was the one we shouldn't have made,'' he said. Soon, the prices of precious metals started to rise, followed by the prices of other commodities later in the year. **********Those price gains were largely ignored by Fed watchers, who, drawing on their experience of the early 1980's, saw monetary aggregates -- M1, M2 and other money supply statistics -- as the most important indicators of economic direction. By the time Federal Reserve policy makers agreed that inflation was picking up again, ''we were behind the curve,'' Mr. Angell said. **********Had the Fed bumped rates up closer to 7 percent in the first quarter of 1987, it might have orchestrated a soft landing of the economy and avoided the market turmoil to come, he said. Instead, its inaction was compounded by a a surprise move in early June by the Reagan White House: the decision not to reappoint Mr. Volcker as Fed chairman and to name Mr. Greenspan -- the former chief economic adviser to President Gerald R. Ford but mostly an unknown quantity as a monetary policy maker -- to the post instead. **********Mr. Greenspan took office in mid-August and the Fed finally raised rates on Sept. 4, but by then world markets had lost confidence in its resolve. ''I think there was a question about the Federal Reserve's credibility,'' Mr. Angell said. ''The 30-year bond would not have been able to rise well above 10 percent without some people making pretty heavy bets that monetary policy would not be able to bring inflation down.'' **********Stock prices had already started to slip further in early October, as the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- rose a quarter-point and the yield on long-term Treasuries rose above 10 percent for the first time in two years. The mood of the stock and bond markets was not helped when Salomon Brothers announced its intention to close its municipal bond department and lay off 10 percent of its staff, setting the tone for retrenchments around Wall Street. **********Today, the monetary picture could not be more different. Mr. Greenspan, confirmed to a third four-year term last year by an adulatory Senate, reigns as the inflation-slaying idol of the financial markets. While some people worry that he is not keeping the credit reins quite tight enough, most people expect him to work them with just the right finesse. **********The discount rate is at 5 percent, the same as it was a year ago, while in the same period short-term Treasury bills have hovered at just over 5 percent and 30-year bonds have eased to 6.65 percent from 6.79 percent. And nobody pays attention to M1 or M2 anymore. **********''I'm not suggesting that the Federal Reserve is that much smarter today than in 1987,'' Mr. Angell said. ''But I feel confident that the Federal Reserve has a lot of credibility. As a result, there is little likelihood that the Fed will have to raise interest rates a whole bunch or make a whole series of increases.'' He expects the Federal funds rate, now at 5.5 percent, to end the year at 5.75 percent. **********Disunity at the Top **********The confusion surrounding American monetary policy in 1987 was not limited to interest rates. Nobody could quite figure out the Federal Government's stance toward the dollar. **********The dollar's strength, or weakness, exerts a huge influence over the American economy. A strong dollar makes American goods more expensive overseas, weakening demand and thus widening the country's chronic trade deficit. A weak dollar, on the other hand, makes imports more expensive, and thus can be inflationary. One of the main tools for modifying the dollar's value is raising or lowering interest rates, which makes dollar-denominated securities more, or less, appealing to investors. **********In early 1987, the Reagan Administration switched its policy from one favoring a weaker dollar to one that was officially neutral and finally, in mid-April, modified it further with a declaration by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d that further declines would be ''counterproductive.'' But it was reluctant to implement the higher interest rates and narrower budget deficits that would make that goal a reality. **********Worries about the dollar's continued slide had started to push interest rates higher in mid-March, catching many bond traders and Wall Street firms by surprise. In the second quarter, Wall Street firms lost $1 billion because of higher long-term rates. **********Financial markets were also caught in the intricate crossfire among the industrial powers over whether the best way to stabilize the dollar was for Washington to do more to tighten fiscal policy or whether Germany and Japan should do more to stimulate domestic spending. September also brought into the open the conflict between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, with Mr. Greenspan apparently determined to demonstrate his independence from the Administration on coordinating international economic policy. **********Today, by contrast to 1987, the dollar is stable and relatively strong. In the last year, it has risen about 22 percent against the Japanese yen and 26 percent against the German mark, with the recent budget accord between President Clinton and the Republican Congress providing another bulwark. **********More important, there is no lack of cooperation between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, now led by Robert E. Rubin and his Deputy Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers. ''It would appear that Alan Greenspan and Bob Rubin have regular weekly meetings, and they appear clearly in sync,'' Mr. Angell said. ''You don't have any statements coming from Larry Summers or Bob Rubin that would cause you to say, 'Does this make sense in regard to what the Fed is doing?' '' **********Other Economic Worries **********Aside from all the confusion emanating from lawmakers and policy gurus 10 years ago, serious economic dislocations were developing at home and abroad. **********By late August 1987, oil prices had climbed above $20 a barrel because of uncertainty in the Persian Gulf, where foreign oil tankers were flying American flags and sailing under American escort. **********Moreover, the trade deficit was still ballooning despite the lower dollar, which was just beginning to help make American goods more competitive in world markets. **********The banking system was in serious straits. Congress approved a $10.8 billion infusion into the beleaguered Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which insured deposits in savings and loan associations, many of which already were suffering the ill effects of real estate loans gone sour. But everyone close to the situation knew that the money was grossly inadequate and that the Reagan Administration wanted to put off dealing with the problem until after the 1988 election. **********Simultaneously, Brazil threatened the big American money-center banks with a refusal to repay its debts. In the second quarter, the 15 largest United States banks added more than $10 billion to their reserves for possible loan losses, the largest such move since the Great Depression and one that significantly cut the pool of money available for loan to American corporations. **********Today, all those problems have receded into memory. World oil production is rising, and many analysts expect prices to decline from the current $20 to $21 a barrel to $18 or less in the next few months -- though American dependence on imported oil has grown, auguring potential problems for the economy if there is ever an abrupt cutoff of supplies. The trade deficit is down substantially as a percentage of gross national product. And the banking system is healthy. **********Then Again, You Never Know **********For all the differences between 1997 and 1987, the economy wasn't all that bad back then. Indeed, after the October crash led to an easing of Fed policy, the economy continued to grow for nearly three years. In the view of some analysts, the market collapse that fateful fall day was not as bad as it seemed. **********Mr. Lynch, the former Magellan fund manager, noted that in 1986-87 the market first went up 1,000 points in 11 months and then went down 1,000 points in two months. ''If the market had instead gone sideways for a year, people wouldn't have been worried at all,'' he said. ''In fact, nothing really happened. Companies were doing well. Corporate profits were O.K.. The crash was one of those funny things that happen in time. **********''There is a big misconception that everyone lost money in 1987,'' he added. ''But the market was up for the year. Everyone did not put money in the market in August and take it all out in October.'' **********And if the economy was not as bad then as many people now assume, it is also not necessarily as invulnerable now as some would like to think. After all, Murphy's Law -- if something can go wrong, it will -- often strikes when people are reveling most loudly in their good fortune. **********For example, said Mr. Farrell of Merrill Lynch, it not yet clear how the market will react to last month's budget agreement. ''It is hard to read right now, but it is going to affect the market in some way,'' he said. **********Mr. Lynch finds great reassurance in the small talk he indulges in with strangers on airplanes. ''I don't have people recommending stocks to me these days,'' he said. ''That's usually the final sign of the speculative boom: People recommend stocks to me, and those stocks go up. There are four phases of reactions people have when I meet them on an airplane and they ask what I do and I say I manage money. In the first phase, they say, 'Oh,' and they go on to the next subject. In the second phase, they ask, 'What do you like?' In the third phase, they might then recommend you take a look at something. But in the fourth phase, they recommend a stock to you and you take a look at it and you notice that it goes up substantially. We don't seem to have entered that phase yet.'' **********The Downward Spiral **********After the market peak on Aug. 25, 1987, it was a short trip to the market meltdown. In its first meeting after Mr. Greenspan took charge, the Fed finally made its move, raising the discount rate by half a percentage point, to 6 percent, on Sept. 4. But the market sensed that further tightening was in the offing. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had already slid 5 percent from its peak, continued to drift down, as investors weighed signs of higher inflation. Then, in quick succession, the index of leading indicators registered its sixth consecutive increase, signaling a strong economy that might have to be reined in; foreigners appeared to be steady sellers of Treasury bonds, indicating that rates would have to go up to attract enough future buyers; and, in mid-September, the Government reported that industry operated at 81 percent of capacity in August, the highest level since late 1984, another sign that the credit noose would have to be tightened. **********By early October, investors had learned that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.8 percent the previous month, its lowest rate in eight years, and money-center banks moved independently of the Federal Reserve to raise their lending rates, lifting the prime rate half a percentage point, to 9.25 percent. **********On Wednesday, Oct. 14, the Dow suffered its largest single-day point drop: 95 points, or 3.8 percent. The next day, Chemical Bank led its peers in raising the prime rate by another half-point, to 9.75 percent. The Dow, helped along by a furious rate of futures-related trading as institutions sought to lock in the year's still-impressive portfolio gains, fell another 57 points, to 2,355. **********Before the week ground to a halt, however, stock prices collapsed in a broad selloff on Friday, Oct. 16, again spurred by a heavy bout of futures-related program, or computer-driven, trading. Capping the stock market's worst week since the week in 1940 when France fell to the Germans, the Dow recorded its first daily loss of more than 100 points and finished the week down 9.5 percent. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the heaviest ever, at 338.5 million shares. At the end of the day, the bellwether market index stood at 2,246, or 17.5 percent below its August peak. **********And the worst was yet to come."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/16/business/software-piracy-suspected-in-advertising-industry.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Sorkin", "pub_date": "1997-07-16", "snippet": "Some people in computer industry are scrutinizing advertising industry, contending that software piracy is rampant; Business Software Alliance, watchdog group, is expected to announce $135 million settlement with Lamar Corp, outdoor advertising co...", "word_count": 287, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Software Piracy Suspected in Advertising Industry", "print_headline": "Software Piracy Suspected in Advertising Industry", "body_text": " **********Some people in Silicon Valley are scrutinizing the advertising industry, contending that software piracy is rampant. **********The Business Software Alliance, a watchdog group, is expected to announce a $135,000 settlement today with the Lamar Corporation, an outdoor advertising company, for unauthorized copying of applications such as Microsoft Word and Adobe Pagemaker. **********The alliance is also expected to announce that it is investigating nearly a dozen other advertising companies suspected of using copies of software they did not pay for. **********''Piracy is pervasive in the advertising industry,'' said Greg Wren, corporate counsel for Adobe Systems Inc.

Some of the ground north of this sleepy town, near the North Korean border, has been salted with mines by United States and South Korean forces to deter a North Korean attack. **********The campaign by Diana, Princess of Wales, and others against land mines helped focus international attention on the issue, forcing President Clinton to enter the United States into negotiations with about 100 nations aiming at banning anti-personnel land mines by the end of the year. The ban would not cover other mines like anti-tank mines. **********But the Clinton Administration is seeking an exception for the Korean Peninsula, so that in areas like this new mines could continue to be laid indefinitely. **********The reason the Administration favors the continuing use of mines in Korea is that if the usual image associated with land mines is that of Angolan or Cambodian children without legs, here it is a bit different. **********In South Korea, there are countless land mines, but they are in restricted areas that cause few casualties, and many American troops and South Korean civilians alike feel safer because of the minefields. **********Indeed, as supporters of mines here see it, land mines in South Korea are virtually a symbol of peace and security. **********''Many people talk about the humanitarian aspects of land mines,'' said Lieut. Gen. Park Yong Ok, the Deputy Defense Minister and a fervent defender of the mines. ''Deterrence of war is more humanitarian than anything. If we fail to deter war, a tremendous number of civilians will be killed. And the use of land mines is a very effective way of deterring war.'' **********It may be very difficult to win approval for the Korea exemption in the negotiations, because the talks -- called the Ottawa process, since Canada is leading the way -- are dominated by countries that are firmly opposed to the mines. Some major mine-producing countries, like Russia, China and North Korea, are not joining the talks and are not expected to adhere to any ban they produce. **********In any case, critics of the American position warn that Washington's insistence on its own exception for South Korea could delay the negotiations, erode the moral force of the eventual ban on mines and encourage other countries to try to weaken the final document as well. **********It is still unclear how much political heat the White House is willing to absorb to fight for the right to use land mines in Korea, and whether it might eventually cave in under pressure. Land mines are not the kind of things that either politicians or generals relish defending. **********Indeed, this is one battle in which the United States forces in South Korea showed no enthusiasm for stepping forward to back their Commander in Chief. Officials here said that no American military officer here would speak in favor of the exception for land mines in Korea. **********Three times the United States military forces scheduled visits for a reporter to meet front-line troops who supposedly would explain why mines are necessary in Korea, and each time they canceled. The problem, one official explained, is that none of the soldiers wanted to say anything nice about something so widely associated in the public mind with mutilated children. **********Land mines were widely used by both sides in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, and in the years after the war many civilians were killed when forgotten mines exploded. There are still some incidents today, but they are rare. **********''Lots of people were killed by mines up there, some killed and some maimed,'' said Lee Han Gwee, a farmer who with her husband in the 1980's tilled some land that was opened up to agriculture near the North Korean border. ''South Korea had put the mines there, and they tried to dig them out. Then they opened the land to farmers, but they hadn't found all the mines.'' **********Ms. Lee, 69, who was sorting red peppers beside her house, said that no one in her family was injured, but that many farmers on nearby plots were. Other farmers in the area near the border said that they, too, had heard of peasants being killed by mines, but they added that such incidents were rare. **********The minefields, which were intended to stop a North Korean invasion, are in zones that ordinary civilians are not allowed to enter. The mines are mostly not in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas -- for it is, after all, supposed to be demilitarized. Instead, they are placed on the main invasion routes that North Korea would be expected to use. **********''We don't put mines in the DMZ, but if you go one millimeter south of it, you've got to be really careful where you walk,'' said Jim Coles 3d, a civilian spokesman for the 37,000 American troops in South Korea, who addressed the issue after his colleagues in uniform declined to. ''The use of mines here is extensive but judicious, aimed at preventing breakthroughs and not just at blowing people up.'' **********Mr. Coles cited three purposes for the mines in South Korea: to deter a North Korean attack, to slow down any invasion and thin enemy ranks, and to force attackers into more vulnerable territory called ''killing zones'' in the military. **********While most of the minefields were laid years ago, they still require some maintenance and replacement, officials said. Periodic brush fires sweep through the hills near the demilitarized zone, causing mines to explode and obliging troops to lay new ones. **********Every military expert is sure that the United States and South Korean forces could defeat a North Korean attack without using any land mines. But most of the experts say that to slow a North Korean invasion and hasten its end it would be helpful to lay down new mines as well as rely on existing minefields. **********One of the fundamentals of North Korean military doctrine is said to be surprise and speed in any attack, so that the North could seize the entire peninsula before United States reinforcements arrived. So the essence of South Korean planning is to frustrate any North Korean blitzkrieg with mines and tank traps and to bog it down until reinforcements arrived. **********South Korean planners say that another reason why they need to slow any invaders is that their capital, Seoul, which has 11 million inhabitants, is less than 40 miles from the North Korean border. **********''Our defense depth is very shallow, and so we have to take defense measures very quickly,'' said Col. Park Tong Hyong, chief of arms control verification in the South Korean Defense Ministry. **********The mines that would be scattered in such a confrontation presumably would be the so-called smart mines, which can be made to self-destruct. The United States forces in Korea would use only smart mines, and the South Koreans have both kinds but suggest that they would be willing to use only the smart kind. **********Still, even with the smart mines, there is a small failure rate, so that a tiny fraction of the mines would remain live even when they were no longer needed. **********Military planners say that mines are not the only way to stop invaders, but that the alternatives would be costly and might mean more casualties. **********One American military study suggested that without the land mines, the United States would need an additional 20,000 or more troops in South Korea to stop a North Korean invasion. Another computer simulation, cited by South Korean officials, estimated that if land mines were not used against a North Korean attack, there would be an additional 2,500 to 3,000 South Korean and American casualties each day of a conflict. **********''Land mines are an integral part of our policy against the North Korean military threat,'' said General Park, the Deputy Defense Minister. ''North Korea possesses a large number of tanks and military artillery, and it's imperative to delay North Korean mechanized troops north of Seoul. **********''From a military standpoint and from a humanitarian standpoint,'' he argued, ''it is clear that we need to use land mines.'' **********--------------------        U.S. Plan Is Opposed **********OSLO, Sept. 2 (Reuters) -- An American proposal to exclude the Korean peninsula from a global ban on land mines ran into stiff opposition today, opponents of mines said at a meeting on the topic that has attracted more than 100 nations. **********The American proposal called for an exemption to permit the United States and South Korea to continue using them on the Korean peninsula. **********Washington indicated that it was not flexible and would walk out of the conference if it lost a vote on the provision, participants here said.

Inderfurth, Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, who has been meeting with the Iranians in New York. **********The United States, which has isolated Iran since the seizure of the United States Embassy in Teheren in 1979 and the holding of American hostages for more than 15 months, nevertheless has some experience in dealing with Iranians in the United Nations system. On occasion, most recently in arms control negotiations, the Iranians have often been less obstructive than, for instance, India, with which Washington has had a long, unbroken relationship. **********Mr. Inderfurth left yesterday for a trip to London, Paris and Moscow to discuss the Afghan problem. He said in an interview on Thursday that since talks began here in the fall that include the United States and Russia as well as Iran and Afghanistan's other neighbors -- Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and China -- other nations had shown an interest in joining in, signaling their hopes that progress can be made. **********The talks at the United Nations, led by Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian Foreign Minister who is Secretary General Kofi Annan's special envoy on Afghanistan, are focused on how to bring the militant Taliban movement, which has taken control of more than 80 percent of Afghanistan, into power-sharing negotiations with a group of allied warlords in the north of the country. **********Although the Taliban are devoutly Islamic, they are ethnic Pathans and Sunni Muslims. The Iranians, who are Persian-speaking Shiite Muslims, have supported one of the groups resisting the Taliban, the ethnic Hazara Shiites' Hizbe Wahdat Party. **********The United States has withheld recognition of the Taliban, criticizing their human rights record, especially their treatment of women, and their unwillingness to compromise with other Afghan ethnic groups. American oil companies are interested in developing gas and oil pipelines from Central Asia to Pakistan or the Arabian Sea through Afghanistan, but they have been advised that finding financing will be difficult with a war going on and no functioning central government in Kabul. **********The United States now seems prepared to put pressure on the Taliban movement, to push it toward a political settlement that would allow it to be recognized internationally. **********Taliban leaders have been encouraged to visit the United States. The first delegation just completed a tour sponsored by Unocal, the California-based oil company that is a major partner in Centgas, one of two international consortiums bidding to build pipelines in Afghanistan. **********The Taliban delegation met in Washington with Mr. Inderfurth and other American officials and also visited the University of Nebraska at Omaha, which is setting up technical training programs in Afghanistan with a $900,000 Unocal grant. Before Communist governments came to power in Afghanistan in the 1970's, culminating in the 1979 Soviet intervention, the United States played a major role in Afghan development. **********Mr. Inderfurth said he hoped that the Taliban officials visiting the United States were ''getting a more realistic sense of the view of the United States, about our desire to play a contructive role in ending the conflict in Afghanistan.'' **********''But they can't have it all,'' he said. ''They will need to work out arrangements so that the legitimate interests of the other groups are taken into account.'' **********Iran, with its history of anti-Communism, has competing commercial interests in the region, including plans for its own pipelines from Central Asia. But a war next door in Afghanistan that neither side seems capable of winning soon does not provide the climate for much confidence in Iran either. Iranians would also like to see nearly two million Afghan refugees return home. **********In taking a more active role in looking for solutions in Afghanistan, the Clinton Administration appears to be taking advantage of a confluence of events that may provide the best opportunity in years to stop the destructive cycle of civil wars. **********First, there is a widely held opinion that the Taliban have advanced as far as is likely in their attempt to conquer the country. **********Robert B. Oakley, a visiting fellow at the National Defense University and a former Ambassador to Pakistan, says time is not on the Taliban's side. **********''The Taliban are never going to be strong enough -- given the geographic problems, the ethnic problems and the military problems -- to conquer the entire country,'' Mr. Oakley said in an interview. ''The Shiites have become a very strong movement in the past two years because they have been fighting hard against the Taliban and because the Iranians have given them a tremendous amount of support.'' **********A second factor is the politics of the region. In Pakistan, months of political turmoil have just ended, leaving Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif strong enough to turn his attention to neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan has tended to support the Taliban unconditionally, a position Washington is urging it to reconsider. **********Mr. Inderfurth's role is also important, experts say. The third-ranking official in the mission to the United Nations when Madeline K. Albright was the American representative there, Mr. Inderfurth is known to have the confidence of Ms. Albright, now Secretary of State, and is expected to have considerable authority for policy in the region."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/17/business/small-jets-alter-airline-economics.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1997-02-17", "snippet": "Bitter dispute between American Airlines and its pilots union stems from growing use of small jets in air travel, where they are replacing turboprop planes on flights that have not usually attracted enough passengers to be served by larger jetline...", "word_count": 1012, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SMALL JETS ALTER AIRLINE ECONOMICS", "print_headline": "SMALL JETS ALTER AIRLINE ECONOMICS", "body_text": " **********The bitter confrontation between American Airlines and its pilots union has its roots in a growing innovation in air travel -- small jets -- that the company wants to use on many routes. **********Also known as regional jets or commuter jets, these aircraft are replacing turboprop planes on flights that have not usually attracted enough passengers to be served by larger jetliners. **********While popular with travelers -- who like the jets' speed and ability to fly above turbulence -- these small planes are seen by the unionized pilots as a way for American Airlines  to replace many of the larger jets, as well as their jobs. **********But American's parent company, the AMR Corporation, continues to insist that the pilots at its American Eagle subsidiary, who earn less, must fly these jets if the company hopes to compete profitably with other carriers that already fly them. **********The intransigence of both sides on the issue goes a long way toward explaining why they were willing to bear the heavy cost and disruption of a strike, which was averted for 60 days when President Clinton intervened early Saturday morning. **********To a degree, the dispute at American Airlines is similar to the labor strife that resulted from significant changes in the steel and telecommunications industries. In those industries, new technology, like the steel industry's mini-mills, allowed companies to operate more efficiently with fewer workers. **********By all accounts, the small jets are rapidly changing the complexion of the airline industry for many travelers. Some industry experts consider the introduction of the small jets to be similar to improvements that enabled aircraft to fly with fewer engines and smaller cockpit crews. **********''The airline industry has always been able to provide travelers lower prices as a result of upgrades in technology,'' said Candace Browning, an airline industry analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, who estimated that half of all commuter airline fleets will be small jets instead of turboprops in 10 years. **********The biggest user of the regional jets in the United States is Comair, a commuter partner of Delta Air Lines, which flies the 50-seat Canadair regional jet on such routes as Cincinnati to Des Moines, and Salt Lake City to Boise, Idaho. **********Canadair, a subsidiary of Bombardier of Montreal, first introduced the small jets into service in 1992, and has delivered 154 of them around the world, and has orders to deliver another 76. Canadair is also planning to build a 70-seat version of its current 50-seat model. Airlines including Continental have also ordered a small jet, the Embraer-145, made in Brazil by Embraer. **********The regional jets cost about $20 million each, compared with $35 million for a Boeing 737 that seats more than 100. **********These jets are in many respects at the leading edge of a shift in the airline industry toward more point-to-point service. Although the industry has evolved in the last two decades around the notion of feeding passengers into big hub airports that require them to take a second flight to their destinations, airlines are also competing increasingly by offering more direct service. The small jets play into this strategy, since they are able to fly longer distances nonstop than turboprop planes, although not as far as larger jetliners. **********The small jets are the latest tool at the airlines' disposal to serve routes that do not generate enough traffic to justify flights by larger aircraft. **********Despite the sophistication of modern turboprop planes, they are widely perceived by travelers as inferior to jets. So much so that cities like Amarillo, Tex., guarantee a profit for American Airlines to offer jet service as part of its effort to grow its local economy. Without such subsidies, American would offer American Eagle service instead, possibly with a regional jet. **********Assessing the long-term impact of the regional jets if they were placed into service in American Eagle or American is a matter of considerable debate between American and its pilots, who are represented by the Allied Pilots Association. **********And their differences on the issue will undoubtedly continue to be a sticking point over the next two months in discussions with a Presidential Emergency Board of three mediators trying to head off another strike by American's pilots, which they will be free to do after 60 days. **********Within 30 days, the mediators will try to come up with a proposal that they think both sides will accept. This week, the two sides are preparing presentations to the mediators, and the settlements that each side suggests do not have to be what was left on the table Friday. **********The positions may revert to those they held before talks began in Washington last week. The company agreed last fall to offer a 5 percent wage increase over four years and 5.75 million stock options to be distributed among the 9,000 pilots at American. But in early January, the rank and file voted against that deal by a margin of almost two-to-one. **********Almost two weeks ago, the pilots announced their new demand: an 11 percent raise over four years and 7.25 million stock options, as well as their insistence that all jet flying be done by American pilots. **********People familiar with details of the recent negotiations that ended in the brief strike said that union leaders had realized that the company would  not give in to the pilots' demands that they fly the small jets. **********That explains why airline executives held their ground and took a strike that they had said they could not afford. Even though pilots halted their strike after 24 minutes, just the threat of a strike drove away enough passengers to cost the airline about $100 million in lost profits, executives said. **********After the strike was halted, Donald J. Carty, president of American Airlines, said that the regional jet issue had been settled, but that the two sides could not agree on the size of a package of raises and stock options for the four-year contract. **********But people familiar with the pilots' stance said the union was demanding  higher raises for giving American what it wanted on the regional jet issue; in effect, the jet issue made the pilots dig in further on their demands about compensation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/05/business/japanese-official-faults-us-procurement.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-04-05", "snippet": "Japanese Trade Minister, Shinji Sato, says he intends to point out to United States what he calls closed nature of Government procurement process in wake of US dumping accusation against NEC Corp of Japan; notes that US has urged Japanese Governme...", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Official Faults U.S. Procurement", "print_headline": "Japanese Official Faults U.S. Procurement", "body_text": " **********The Japanese Trade Minister said yesterday that he intended to point out to the United States what he called the closed nature of its Government procurement process in the wake of the United States' dumping accusation against the NEC Corporation of Japan.

In the five years since Bishop Atanasije was driven out of the city of Mostar by the mostly Roman Catholic Bosnian Croats, who blew up his cathedral and residence, he has baptized some 10,000 Bosnian Serbs, he said, sometimes taking groups to the valley below this remote village to wade into the Trebisnica River. **********''After 50 years of Communist evil,'' he said, ''the Serbs have returned to the faith. The church is growing in strength and power.'' **********As the enclave that is Republika Srpska drifts toward economic chaos and political isolation, the Serbian Orthodox Church has emerged as its ideological and spiritual bulwark. **********After decades of repression, under the fascist Government during World War II and then Tito's Communist state, the church reasserted itself, fostering the volatile fusion of nation, self and religion that helped trigger the recent war. It became a standard-bearer of nationalism, championing the notion of a Serbia that would bring all Serbs in the region into its fold. **********But as Serbs fought to carve out their own territory from dismembered Yugoslavia, the church paid a heavy price. Scores of houses of worship and other buildings were destroyed and clerics displaced in the fighting with Muslims and Croats. **********Even so, the 1995 Dayton peace accord, which affirmed the borders of a Serbian Bosnia separate from Serbia within the remains of Yugoslavia, dismayed many nationalists. The church denounced the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, for ''betraying the Serbian people'' by signing the accord. Now many clerics promote in his place the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, an indicted war criminal at times referred to as ''Saint'' Karadzic. **********''The whole world turned against us,'' said Rajko Palikuca, 44, a Serb. ''Belgrade in the end abandoned us, but the church was always by our side. It understood our suffering. Its authority and its word are considered by Bosnian Serbs to be law. We look at Republika Srpska as a religious state.'' Mr. Palikuca is a church deacon. **********The church's support for Republika Srpska -- which, unlike Serbia, permits religious education in public schools -- led two years ago to the opening of Bosnia's only Serbian Orthodox seminary, in the town of Foca. It was there that Bosnian Serbs carried out some of the worst atrocities of the war against the Muslim former inhabitants. Today the town, flanked by steep mountains, is surrounded by the dynamited ruins of Muslim houses and mosques. **********In an abandoned girls' reform school, 350 young men prepare for the priesthood in the religious high school and the seminary. Nearly all of the 72 seminarians are former Bosnian Serb soldiers. And those seminarians who did not serve in the army are encouraged to do their military service before ordination. **********The 10 priests who run the seminary came from the 350-year-old St. Vasilije seminary in the Croatian city of Knin. They fled, along with the 200,000 Croatian Serbs who had established a rebel enclave at the start of the war, when the enclave was overrun by Croatian troops in 1995. The priests lost not only the seminary but its library, with 50,000 theological texts. Croatian authorities have repeatedly turned down their requests to retrieve the books. **********''Once the war ended I knew I had a vocation as a priest,'' said Vladislav Topalovic, 23, a student and former soldier. ''My generation found its identity in the church. We saw the war as an effort by Muslims and Croats to destroy this identity. The church is what gives us meaning.'' **********The Serbian Orthodox Church rose out of the Eastern church's schism with Rome in 1054. Its priests remain steeped in the austere, patriarchal teachings of third- and fourth-century holy fathers, and they recite an ancient Slavic liturgy that most Serbs cannot understand. The church's principal theological concept, ''sabornost,'' forbids individual interpretation of the scriptures and a relationship with God that circumvents the priest. **********At the seminary one afternoon, Metropolitan Nikolaj, the highest-ranking Serbian Orthodox official in Bosnia, dismissed the Roman Catholic Church as a ''political organization'' and Islam as ''probably not a religion at all, but a weird mixture of Judaism and Christianity.'' **********Then he recalled Serbian grievances that had fueled the recent conflict. Under the Croatian Ustashe, which ran one of Nazi Germany's most brutal satellite states, hundreds of thousands of Serbs, including 131 priests and bishops, were killed. Hundreds of Serbian Orthodox churches, monasteries and chapels were blown up, often with Serbs locked inside. **********Croatian fascists killed 43 of the Metropolitan's relatives during the Second World War, he said, and during the Balkan conflict, Bosnian Croats drove him from his home in Bosanski Petrovac, where his family had lived for 400 years. **********''Our people are used to suffering,'' he said. ''We spent 500 years as the slaves of the Turks. We do not ask for any theological explanations. In the house of the Serbian nation, tears are the host and joy is a guest.'' **********It was the Serbian leader Saint Sava who, when the Crusaders seized Constantinople, the seat of the Eastern church, in the 13th century, founded a separate Serbian church within the Eastern Orthodox tradition. He coined the slogan ''Only Unity Saves the Serbs,'' or ''Samo Sloga Srbina Spasava.'' The symbol for this slogan, a cross surrounded by four Cyrillic S's, is the calling card of the Serbs. It has been spray-painted on village walls and on tens of thousands of gutted Muslim homes. **********''No one can be blamed for this war,'' the Metropolitan said. ''All sides sinned. We cannot say who caused the war -- this will be left for the generations that follow. But the Serbs fought a defensive war, a war to protect their homes, their churches and their land. There are forces always ready to destroy the Serbs, and this is why three times this century Serbs have fought attempts to annihilate them. Serbs must be ready.'' **********The notion that enemies, from the start of the Turkish occupation in 1389 to the present, are looming to wipe out the Serbian nation is carefully nurtured by the church. **********Bishop Atanasije, 58, stood outside his monastery, which is nestled in the bare, white limestone hills near the Dalmatian Coast. He looked at the shattered pieces of a stone monument erected 40 years ago in memory of 101 men, women and children executed in the nearby village of Cavas by the Croatian fascists during World War II. Bosnian Croats destroyed the monument during the recent war, and international peacekeepers transported it to the monastery in pieces. **********''The youngest victim was 15 days old and the oldest was 90,'' the Bishop said, his black robe billowing out in a breeze. ''We will rebuild this monument in front of the monastery so no one forgets.'' **********But the recent carnage haunts many of the men awaiting ordination. Whatever comfort the church offers, it is clear that many young Serbs remain troubled by the years of violence and ''ethnic cleansing.'' **********''I used to pray before every attack that I would not have to kill again,'' said Stanko Micevic, 27, a seminarian who fought for the Bosnian Serbs throughout the war. **********When asked what had happened when he had been forced to kill, his eyes welled up with tears. **********''This,'' he said, extending a hand that would not stop trembling."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/10/business/worldbusiness/IHT-cyberscape-novells-ceo-dares-europe-to-take-some.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Floren", "pub_date": "1997-11-10", "snippet": "Eric Schmidt is chief executive officer of Novell Corp., the world's fifth- largest software maker, which specializes in developing software that manages computer networks.

On a recent trip to Europe, he spoke with Paul Floren of the International Herald Tribune. **********- **********Q. In the past year, a number of CEOs from leading North American information-technology companies have been complaining that Europe is lagging terribly behind much of the rest of the world in adopting technology. Would you agree? **********A. In my experience, the leading IT firms in Europe are as state-of-the-art as they are in the United States or any other place. The issue for Europe is that there is a lower percentage of them. You can see this in the lack of Internet usage, which is a huge competitive disadvantage for Europe. **********I think Europe, in order to address these problems, needs to change the policies behind telecommunications and other technologies. One of the interesting benefits is that as a result of Europe lagging behind, technology markets will grow faster for IT companies here. There will be more people trying to get state-of-the-art faster, because everybody knows that it is important in order to be globally competitive. **********Q. Is it likely that technology is going to be created in Europe? **********A. For this to happen, there are a number of structural changes that must occur. **********What is important in Europe is the development of a venture industry that creates local investment opportunity for local start-ups and technology innovation. Furthermore, in the United States we are benefiting from a high tolerance for failure, whereas in some European countries it is in fact criminal to have your business fail. As a result, executives are less likely to take risks. **********The whole question of competence is not at issue. People in Europe are certainly as smart, if not smarter, and certainly as well educated, if again not better. It is simply a structural issue, and there is simply no excuse for not fixing it. **********Q. It would seem that U.S. information-technology companies are increasingly interested in developing research facilities in Europe. Could this help European innovation? **********A. I don't think that the way to solve this problem is to mandate investment like we have seen over the last 10 years. This has been a big mistake. Rather, the right way to do it is to create positive incentives for local business people and entrepreneurs to create great global products. This is the only way in the long term. The deregulation of the telecommunications market is very positive because it should unleash enormous amounts of innovation. **********Q. How do you perceive the \"year 2000\" problem? **********A. Personally, I am surprised at how bad the problem is. I was not aware, and I think most people were not aware, at how extensive these 30- to 35-year-old solutions were in the industry as a whole. A number of customers that I have spoken to have enormous business problems updating programs for which the programmers are literally dead. **********I have reluctantly concluded that all the press about the \"year 2000\" problem is in fact correct. The danger, of course, is that the year 2000 problem coupled with the Euro, which occurs one year earlier \u2014 and by the way, you could not have scheduled it at a worse time from an IT perspective \u2014 will likely drain a lot of funds from a lot of other things. **********Q. You left Sun Microsystems Corp. last April. Why? **********A. I had been at Sun for 14 years, and I had done pretty much everything that I wanted to do, including much of the Java stuff. I was interested in what was the next great area of innovation, and my conclusion after looking at it for a while is that there was one area in which there was likely to be a great deal of opportunity, excitement, competition and change with no entrenched leader, and that is in the area of what people do on networks, or what we call network services."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/12/your-money/IHT-managers-shop-for-best-bond-returns-global-funds-enjoy-the.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Rehak", "pub_date": "1997-07-12", "snippet": "AMERICAN TREASURY bonds have enjoyed a powerful rally since April, when the yield on the bellwether 30-year issue peaked at 7.18 percent.

Now, many managers of global bond funds, who can shop around the world for the best returns, are shunning the 6.51 percent returns available on U.S. Treasuries Friday afternoon , opting for other markets that they hope will be more lucrative. **********In the United States, multisector bond funds typically send about a third of their assets overseas. Over the last two years, the booming American junk bond market has propelled their returns, but many are looking to their foreign stakes\u2014and beyond\u2014for fatter yields. **********\"What we're seeing more and more of late is fund managers taking their foreign sovereign debt and shifting it into emerging-market debt,\" said Eric Jacobson, a fixed-income analyst at Morningstar Inc., the Chicago-based fund tracker. **********The more conservative funds have bought Brady bonds, dollar-denominated, restructured bank debt, sticking with issues from countries like Poland, whose sovereign credit rating is improving, Mr. Jacobson said. **********At the other end of the spectrum is the $264 million Lazard Strategic Yield fund, which has committed a 34 percent stake to local currency debt in countries such as Croatia, Kenya and Peru. As dicey as that sounds, Alice Lowenstein, who follows the fund for Morningstar, considers it low-risk because it is spread in small amounts among 37 countries. **********\"The fund has gone quite a bit further in its strategy,\" she said, \"but, that said, these investments have been very good for it.\" **********Strategic Yield had a total return of 13.75 percent last year and is up about 5 percent this year, placing it in the top third of multisector funds. **********But not all portfolio managers are enthralled with emerging-market debt. **********\"It's done well in the past two years, but there could be some unhappy investors because that area is a lot more volatile,\" said Robert Alley, who runs the AIM Income fund, recalling losses inflicted by Mexico's peso devaluation in 1994. **********Instead, Mr. Alley, who is based in Houston, sticks with developed countries for the 30 percent overseas portion of his $340 million fund, up 4.9 percent this year. Lately, with the dollar hitting a three-and-a-half-year high against the Deutsche mark, he has been trimming his German and French holdings, and moving into dollar-influenced markets with higher yields, such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand. **********In New Zealand, for example, a 10-year government bond yields about 6.74 percent, compared with just 6.20 percent for a comparably dated U.S. Treasury. Is there need to worry about foreign-exchange fluctuations? **********\"Their currency has already weakened against the U.S. dollar,\" Mr. Alley added, \"so the downside currency risk is out.\" **********He has also been adding to one of his most profitable non-U.S. bets, a stake in British government bonds. The gilt market registered a strong month in June, rising 2.83 percent in dollar terms. **********Britain's gilt market also looks appealing to Marc Vernooij, who invests in developed Europe from Amsterdam, where he runs the ABN Amro Europe Bond Fund. Fueling his enthusiasm is the decision of the British government to make the Bank of England independent. **********\"We expect the bank to be more focused on low inflation and stable currency, and that's a bond-friendly environment,\" he said. Moreover, he said, \"It's the highest-yielding market in Europe.\" Currently, 10-year gilts are yielding about 7.02 percent, far above the paltry return of 5.54 percent in German bunds, the European benchmark. **********Like others who invest in the bonds of Europe's developed economies, one of Mr. Vernooij's most successful strategies in the last two years has been the \"convergence\" play, contributing to his fund's 10.8 percent rise for the year to the end of June. Under this scenario, countries preparing for European monetary union have been reforming their economies and thus pushing down yields on their government bonds toward the German equivalents. This has caused their prices to soar, producing handsome returns for fixed-income investors. **********But now, with the convergence play winding down for countries like France and the Netherlands, Mr. Vernooij has turned to the shorter-maturity bond markets of Italy and Spain. **********\"Shorter rates in Italy are still over 6 percent, much higher than Germany, where they are about 3.4 percent,\" he said. He is betting that monetary union will happen \"on time,\" in a year and a half, spelling a price run-up in three-to-four-year Italian bonds as their yields fall to meet their German benchmarks. Accordingly, he has boosted his stake in Italy to 26 percent from 18 percent. **********Mr. Vernooij has duplicated his Italy and Spain strategy in ABN Amro's Global Bond fund, which he also manages. But since this vehicle allows him to shop outside Europe, he also is sending some of his cash to dollar-bloc countries, although he emphasized it was not going to the United States. **********\"After the recent bond rally there, a lot of value is out of that market,\" he said. Australia and Canada top his list. **********In Asia, regional debt funds are still few in number because there was little to buy until recently. Only the Philippines issued Brady bonds, and most Asian corporations have historically borrowed from banks. **********To widen the choices in this narrow market, one of the oldest funds, the Guinness Flight Asian Currency & Debt Fund, started in late 1993, also includes Australia, Japan and New Zealand. Like Mr. Vernooij and Mr. Alley, Daniel Hemmant, the fund's manager, favors Australia and New Zealand. Currently, New Zealand represents the largest holding, 16 percent, in his portfolio. \"The fundamentals there are good right now, because inflation is controlled,\" Mr. Hemmant said. \"Short-term interest rates were higher, but there is still a lot of scope to cut them because the economy is slowing.\" **********Although he can invest in local currency debt in the region's less developed markets, Mr. Hemmant prefers dollar-denominated bonds for now. **********\"With things like Thailand blowing up, it makes more sense to be defensive,\" he said, referring to the recent devaluation of the Thai baht. His fund owns dollar-denominated corporate debt in Indonesia, mostly in the country's big pulp and paper producers, such as five-year bonds yielding 9 percent in Indah Kiat Pulp & Paper Corp. **********\"It's one of the world's lowest-cost producers, and it has made a profit, even at the bottom of the industry cycle,\" he said. **********Mr. Hemmant also owns dollar-denominated debt of the Korean Development Bank. Despite the country's political problems, he does not think they will have trouble paying it off. Meanwhile, he said, \"You're quite well paid for holding double A/single A-rated, 10-year debt yielding 0.90 of a percentage point over 10-year U.S. Treasuries.\" **********He has also ventured into China, buying dollar-issued debt in Guangdong Enterprises Ltd., the development finance company owned by China's southern province, yielding a hefty 2.20 percentage points over comparable U.S. Treasuries. **********While they offer attractive yields, the real value of such bonds is in their improving credit risk, he added, as their issuers continue to produce good earnings, and foreign investors become more comfortable with them. Moody's Investors Service upgraded Guangdong Enterprises to an investment-grade Baa3 in May, citing the provincial government's vow to give the company \"financial and other necessary support.\" **********For further information, call: **********ABN AMRO EUROPE BOND FUND and ABN AMRO GLOBAL BOND FUND, 352 42 49 49 349 or 352 42 49 49 349. **********AIM INCOME FUND, 1 713 626 1919, or, toll-free in the United States, 1 800 347 4246. **********GUINNESS FLIGHT ASIAN CURRENCY & BOND FUND, 44 1481 71 217."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/14/business/inside-074268.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INSIDE", "print_headline": "INSIDE", "body_text": " **********INVESTING IT/Page 4/ **********Avis may try harder, but its initial public offering compares poorly with Hertz's.

After mass protests, strikes and a political uproar, Krupp dropped its hostile takeover plans this week when it became clear that the two were prepared to merge on friendly terms. **********The outline of the merged Thyssen-Krupp steel company will be presented Thursday at a news conference at Thyssen's headquarters in Duesseldorf, a Thyssen representative said. **********Local politicians and unions declared a partial victory after the companies gave assurances that jobs would be cut through a costly program of voluntary departures, early retirements, retraining and transfers rather than layoffs. **********Even so, the cuts will add to the high unemployment in Germany's depressed coal and steel heartland in the Ruhr Valley. The Ruhr region has an 18 percent jobless rate, roughly the average in Eastern Germany. **********Dieter Vogel, chairman of the Thyssen management board, said on German television that the consequences of a hostile takeover \"would have been far worse than what will happen now that Thyssen will steer the fusion.\" **********\"This is not about cutting jobs, but rather restructuring that will be accompanied by new technologies and considerable investments so that we remain competitive,\" Mr. Vogel said. \"Naturally, this cannot be done completely without reductions, but we will try to do this without layoffs.\" **********Hardest hit by job reductions will be Krupp's technologically outdated plant in Dortmund, company sources said, but there were conflicting reports Wednesday about plans for Dortmund. **********The IG Metall steelworkers union said all blast-furnace operations there would be phased out. Hans-Wilhelm Grasshoff, the chief of Krupp's steel unit, told workers that two of the three Dortmund blast furnaces there would be closed down, while Wolfgang Clement, the Social Democratic economy minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, said 3,600 of the 5,700 steel jobs would be cut at Dortmund. **********\"We are still uncertain about what will happen at Dortmund in terms of jobs and output,\" the Thyssen representative said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/01/business/israel-corp-to-raise-chemical-concern-stake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-01-01", "snippet": "Israel Corp, one of Israel's largest holding companies, plans to double its stake in Israel Chemicals Ltd (S)", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Corp. to Raise Chemical Concern Stake", "print_headline": "Israel Corp. to Raise Chemical Concern Stake", "body_text": " **********The Israel Corporation, one of Israel's largest holding companies, with investments in more than 70 companies, plans to double its stake in Israel Chemicals Ltd., one of the country's largest chemical concerns.

Bullets and bombs are not yet flying, but rumors of the imminent arrival of the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, are -- and they leave no one here indifferent. **********By the time peace talks ended inconclusively late Sunday between Mr. Kabila and the cancer-stricken longtime President of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, in neighboring Congo, the rumor mill here was already spinning out of control. **********International flights out of Zaire would be suspended as of Wednesday, said one rich, panic-stricken Zairian, afraid of being trapped here by the rebels. Western troops encamped across the river in Congo would be here before Mr. Kabila's fighters could get here, another more hopeful story had it. **********Worst of all, for those who felt they were guilty by association with Africa's longest-standing President, was the apparently unfounded rumor that guerrilla units were already in place in Kinshasa. **********But if the wealthy were anticipating the future with alarm, poorer residents were looking back with disgust. ''Didn't you notice that you had to drive through a lot of mud to get here,'' asked Justin Mukema, a 24-year-old student in the Macina district, near Kinshasa's international airport. ''Is it normal that the streets should be like this in the capital of a country that is rich? Mobutu has tricked all of his adversaries until now, but the time has finally come for him to go.'' **********In a seven month campaign for power, Mr. Kabila's forces have swept clear across this huge country and are indeed preparing to grab the capital, with its five million residents. But as with every other battle in what may be remembered as Africa's most lopsided war, the rebel leader seems to have selected provocative rhetoric as his weapon of choice for capturing Kinshasa. **********As Mr. Kabila spoke from his southern stronghold of Lubumbashi this morning, his opening shots in the siege of the capital came as a direct personal threat to the embattled President: ''If Mobutu surrenders power now I will guarantee his safety and that of his biological family. If not, we will have to chase him away in humiliation.'' **********Mr. Kabila claimed that his fighters were only 40 miles away from Kinshasa's international airport, at the capital's eastern edge, and would begin carrying out their threat against the President ''within two or three days.'' **********The warning came as Bill Richardson, who is the United States' chief delegate to the United Nations and President Clinton's special envoy here, flew to Lubumbashi to urge Mr. Kabila to cooperate in efforts to arrange what the diplomat called ''a peaceful entry into Kinshasa.'' **********Word of a supposed rebel threat to the Kinshasa airport was already hanging thickly in the air Sunday evening, however, explaining, many here believe, Mr. Mobutu's abrupt decision not to take a 45-minute flight home from the meetings in Congo's port city of Pointe-Noire last night as expected, but to wait instead until after daybreak today. **********Mr. Kabila has used much the same tactic in capturing every other major city of Zaire: announcing days, sometimes weeks, beforehand that his men are coming and sweating the enemy out by raising the tension level to the point where Government troops flee rather than fight. With each new conquest, the threats grow more and more difficult to ignore, even as they become more fantastic. **********Kinshasa, of course, is different: There is no other city to which to flee anymore. So among Kinshasa's elite, where there is deep disappointment that Mr. Mobutu did not conclude a deal for his departure Sunday that would spare this city a rebel assault, people seem just a hairsbreadth from full-blown panic. **********''Mobutu said his health would not allow him to climb into a helicopter to take him to the meetings with Kabila,'' said one resident of Binza, a hilly neighborhood of huge, high-walled villas. ''Why has he come back here then? When we start hearing gunfire he will surely find a way to jump into a helicopter, and we will be left behind to pay.'' **********Down the hill, in Kinshasa's teeming low-lying districts people cite other reasons for regretting that Mr. Mobutu did not simply quit power, as many poor Kinshasans had hoped he would on Sunday. **********A crowd there heaped invective on Mr. Mobutu, making it clear Mr. Kabila and his rebels will be greeted as eagerly in Kinshasa as in any of the other places they have already conquered. **********''Let Mobutu understand that Zaire does not belong to him anymore,'' said Sylvie Ndjoli, a 30-year-old hospital worker. ''Why didn't he just leave yesterday?'' Then, answering her own question, she added almost wistfully: ''He is too used to the power, the honors, the red carpets. If he loves his people it is not too late to look around, and the balance sheet he will find is disastrous.'' **********But if Mr. Kabila has used morale-sapping propaganda to devastating effect throughout this war, many here fear that even a dying Mr. Mobutu, the man who has run this country for 32 years through ruse and cunning, may have yet more tricks up his sleeve. **********''You cannot count this man out until he is dead,'' said Sylvain Matumbo, a furniture maker. ''And since he considers Zaire his creation, when he dies, he may try to take us all with him.'' **********Indeed, in the Matonge district of Kinshasa today, residents told foreign journalists that they had gotten wind of a plot by Mr. Mobutu to explode a tiny research nuclear reactor to spread radiation over the area and stop Mr. Kabila's advance. **********Others spoke of marabouts, or sorcerer-soothsayers, from Zaire and other parts of Africa being flown into the country to work at the President's side in concocting a spell that will dissipate months of disastrous luck and turn the rebels back. **********A more sober appraisal came from a columnist in Le Potentiel, one of the city's most prominent newspapers. **********Noting that Mr. Mobutu has always had a strong superstitious belief in dates with the number 4 in them, including the two coups in which he took power, the columnist concluded that yesterday's failed meeting, on May 4, signified an end to the chief's magic. **********''The mythification is over,'' wrote Tshidibi Ngondavi.

From now on, four equals bad luck.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/14/business/nokia-reports-76-profit-surge-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-02-14", "snippet": "Nokia says pretax profit climbed 76 percent in fourth quarter of 1996; pretax profit rose to 1.67 billion markkaa, or $341 million; operating profit increased to 1.74 billion markkaa from 1.02 billion, and sales grew 16 percent, to 12.67 billion m...", "word_count": 363, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nokia Reports 76% Profit Surge in Quarter", "print_headline": "Nokia Reports 76% Profit Surge in Quarter", "body_text": " **********Nokia, one of the world's largest manufacturers of mobile telephones, said today that pretax profit jumped 76 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 and that it expected strong growth this year. **********The Finnish company recovered from cost and inventory problems, enabling its pretax profit to rise to 1.67 billion markkaa, or $341 million.

If approved, this would eventually be harmful to all Americans because it would undermine the very essence of a democratic and competitive economy. **********The proposal comes up about twice a decade. It last appeared in earnest during the Bush Administration, when it was part of a package to attempt a comprehensive reform of the financial system. Basically, the argument then was that banks were in difficulty and short of capital. Commercial enterprises would take over the banks, infuse new capital and thereby lift a potential burden from the backs of weary taxpayers, who were already reeling from the cost of the savings and loan bailout. **********This time around, the argument for commercial ownership of banks must take different lines because these days banks are profitable, have healthy balance sheets and may even have excess capital. Indeed, this Administration's case is based less on pragmatism than on fatalism. **********Essentially, Treasury officials assert that the marketplace is already mixing finance and commerce. Insurance companies own securities firms. Nonfinancial corporations own insurance companies. Commercial enterprises are allowed to buy savings institutions and convert them into banks. Therefore, they already have entree into the world of banking. What's the harm in letting them have direct entree? Problems would be minor, the argument goes, since few nonfinancial companies want to take over banks, anyway. **********I strongly disagree. First of all, there will be problems and they will not be minor. But it is particularly misguided to start an analysis of the long-term consequences of such a major policy shift with the assumption that it won't happen much and therefore there is nothing to worry about. Well, if it won't happen much, why authorize it in the first place? **********We should start instead with the assumption that if commercial ownership and control of banks is permitted, it will set the tone for all future consolidation in the industry. It would become commonplace, not exceptional. What, then, will the long-term consequences be? **********The joining of industry and banking would eventually alter the economic and financial system for the worse because it would hurt free enterprise and lead to a corporatist state. And over time, it would produce mammoth entities with a strong influence on the flow of credit and thus on business competition. **********A large corporation could use its bank to extend credit to those who can benefit the whole organization. The bank would attract low-cost funds through insured deposits and could use them to finance retailers, jobbers, manufacturers and individuals who further the distribution of the parent's products and services. The bank might withhold credit from those who are, or could be, competitors to the parent. Thus, the cornerstone of effective banking -- independent credit decisions based on objective evaluation of creditworthiness -- would be undermined. **********For monetary policy, the merging of banking and commerce would be detrimental for at least two reasons. The first is that no matter how many times the authorities may say the opposite, the safety net that now covers large banking institutions deemed to be ''too big to fail'' would have to be extended to shield their parent corporations as well when they are in difficulty during a period of monetary restraint or a business recession. Otherwise, the bank would inevitably be vulnerable to huge withdrawals of deposits. Fire walls between a bank and its parent simply would not work. **********Second, support for a steady anti-inflationary monetary policy would wane if corporations controlled banks. There is a basic difference between banking and industry: banks are the channel through which the central bank tries to achieve its objectives; corporations are the central bank's targets. It is corporate profits that are restrained or enlarged through monetary policy. Consequently, it is in the nature of corporations to have more of an inflationary bias, wanting to avoid any monetary restraint because it slows sales and cuts profits. **********AS for our long-term economic growth, the creation of giant banking-industrial combinations would have numerous detrimental consequences. It would create a powerful, self-perpetuating elite, and it is folly to believe that government would stay aloof from this elite group. Through the back door would come insidious forms of influence-peddling and unaccountable decision-making. **********This industrial-banking-governmental leadership group would become highly protective of existing organizations. For many corporations and wealthy families, the emergence of a corporatist state with an elitist control over the economy may be quite desirable. Economic inefficiencies could be covered up. Downside economic risk could be limited through the safety net. **********Moreover, allowing a commercial enterprise to take over a bank provides no significant compensating benefits. It is not necessary for attracting new capital, nor does it provide experienced, skilled management to help banks deal with periods of stress. A commercial or industrial enterprise is generally unable to provide such executives for a bank (nor would a financial institution be the natural place to look for the scientists, engineers and marketers central to the success of a commercial or industrial enterprise). **********Yes, banking faces formidable challenges. But banks must respond by using their own technical and intellectual resources. I can't see how having a commercial company as owner would help."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/26/business/south-korea-increases-fund-for-bank-bailouts.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-08-26", "snippet": "South Korean Government more than doubles its bank bailout fund to almost $4 billion, offering special loans to Korea First Bank and investments banks at prime interest rates in effort to prevent bankruptcies from crippling financial industry (S)", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Korea Increases Fund for Bank Bailouts", "print_headline": "South Korea Increases Fund for Bank Bailouts", "body_text": " **********The South Korean Government more than doubled its bank bailout fund yesterday to almost $4 billion, offering special loans to Korea First Bank and investment banks at prime interest rates in an effort to prevent bankruptcies from crippling the financial industry. **********In a speech, the Finance and Economy Minister, Kang Kyung Shik Kang, said the Government would increase a special fund to save troubled banks to 3.5 trillion won ($3.9 billion) from 1.5 trillion won.

[Page 6.] **********[On Wednesday, Tokuyo City Bank, a small regional bank burdened by bad loans and rising losses, became the fourth Japanese financial institution to fail this month.] **********For the 50 people lined up quietly outside the Yamaichi branch, panic seemed far from their minds. Like Mr. Shiraishi, most appeared reassured by the Government's statements. **********Rather, several waiting to enter the Yamaichi branch seemed embarrassed. Some wore sunglasses, a fashion accessory far less common in Japan than in the United States. One woman took the extra measure of draping a large scarf over her head. Many buried their faces in books and newspapers, and others turned toward the wall when they saw reporters and photographers. **********Their sheepishness may have partly reflected how the stock market is widely viewed in Japan: a sort of disreputable casino. Making money through shrewd investment, rather than hard work and industry, runs counter to Japanese ethics, a perception that shows up in statistics. **********Of the universe of Japanese personal financial assets, only 6.1 percent are invested in securities, according to J. P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd., compared with 22.4 percent in the United States. The vast majority, 56.9 percent, are held as currency or deposits. **********Indeed, the biggest beneficiary of Yamaichi's collapse will likely be the postal savings system, the $2 trillion pool of savings administered by the Post Office. **********Hosoya Shinobu, a 49-year-old housewife waiting on the Yamaichi line, said that when her husband had dispatched her this morning to claim their assets he said ''gambate,'' or persevere -- a Japanese way of saying ''good luck.'' **********''I'm very worried about the other assets,'' she said. ''I feel I should withdraw all our assets from other institutions as well and put them in postal savings because it's a national institution and that makes me feel safe.'' **********Mrs. Shinobu was not the only one worrying about the overall safety of the Japanese financial system after the collapse of Yamaichi. **********Stocks plunged in the wake of the announcement. The Nikkei index of 225 issues dropped 5.11 percent on Tuesday -- the first day of trading this week -- pulled down by heavy selling of bank shares. **********Japanese newspapers and television spent the weekend assessing the comparative strengths of various banks and brokerage firms. Most reports concluded that the biggest banks would not be allowed to fail, but that a range of weaker second-tier financial institutions would eventually go bust. **********On Friday, Moody's Investors Service rated the financial strength of one Japanese insurer, the Toho Mutual Life Insurance Company, as ''very poor'' and four others as ''poor.'' **********Two banks, the Yasuda Trust and Banking Company and the Chuo Trust and Banking Company, have the ratings agency's lowest rating, and a third, the Long-Term Credit Bank, has its second-lowest rating. **********The public's growing awareness of the depth of the problems that have festered in the financial system since the bubble economy burst here in the early 1990's also seems to have raised acceptance for the idea of using public funds to protect depositors. Many, though, seem wary of using the same money to prop up banks. **********The Government is trying to find a way to use public funds without raising the angry outcry that accompanied a similar bailout of some housing lenders last year. **********''I want them to protect my assets, that's all I want,'' said Masahiko Tada, a 26-year-old salaryman, or midlevel manager, who was waiting to retrieve stocks worth between 700,000 yen and 800,000 yen -- or between roughly $5,555 and $6,350 -- his entire savings. ''I'm not worried about the system itself.'' **********While Mr. Tada and others were not too concerned about the fate of their own assets, they worried that a financial meltdown would threaten Japan's stature internationally. **********Shigeru Morii's 84-year-old mother not only had an account at Yamaichi, but also one at Hokkaido Takushoku, Japan's 20th-largest bank, which failed last week.

But on the inside, the camera holds  what could be the seed of a revolution. **********The camera is the first by a major Japanese electronics company to use a new type of image-capturing device that might one day make possible the exquisitely tiny camera-on-a-chip. **********Such cheap micro-cameras could be plastered everywhere as security monitors or placed in the rear bumpers of cars to help drivers back up. They might even make possible the camera in the glasses frame used by Tom Cruise in ''Mission: Impossible.'' And instead of highlighting a passage in a book with a colored marker, a student of the future might take a snapshot of the passage with a camera built into a pen. **********Until now, camcorders and digital still cameras, which store images electronically rather than on film, have captured images using a chip called a charge-coupled device, or C.C.D. **********But these devices have some drawbacks. They use a lot of power, requiring bulky batteries, and are made with a process different from that used to make other microelectronic circuits. That makes it difficult to combine a C.C.D. with other circuits on the same piece of silicon. **********The LSI Logic Corporation, for instance, will introduce a chip that has almost all the circuitry needed for a digital still camera -- but not the C.C.D., which must still remain separate. **********The Toshiba Corporation's imaging chip, however, is made using a process known as CMOS (pronounced SEA-moss), the same process used for making many other integrated circuits. **********That process could result in economies of scale by allowing the imaging chips to be made on big production lines used for other chips. It should make it possible to combine on a single piece of silicon the image sensor, timing controls, image compression and memory needed for a camera -- producing the camera-on-a-chip. CMOS imaging chips also use far less power than C.C.D.'s. **********One big application could be video cameras small and cheap enough to be built into every personal computer, allowing PC users to hold video conferences. Creative Laboratories Inc., the Singapore company known for its Sound Blaster audio boards, is introducing a PC video conferencing system using a CMOS imaging chip from VLSI Vision Inc. in Edinburgh. **********Sensors using CMOS, which stands for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor, could also tilt the balance of power in the industry, allowing Americans and Europeans a chance to catch up with the Japanese, who now dominate the market both for C.C.D.'s and the camcorders and digital cameras that use them. **********''CMOS imaging allows other companies to get into the imaging business,'' said Bryan Ackland, a researcher for Lucent Technologies, the equipment manufacturer spun off from the AT&T Corporation. Lucent has been researching CMOS imaging chips but has not yet decided to make a product, he said. **********The Sony Corporation and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company are the leading suppliers of the charge-coupled devices, about 20 million of which were produced for use in cameras and camcorders last year. Including simpler devices used in fax machines and other office equipment, the total market was estimated at about $650 million. **********But the CMOS sensors have been pioneered by two start-ups, VLSI in Scotland and Photobit L.L.C. in La Crescenta, Calif., a spinoff from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Other start-ups include Omnivision Technologies in San Jose, Calif., and Suni Imaging Microsystems in Mountain View, Calif. **********Numerous big American companies, including Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Intel and National Semiconductor, are working on CMOS imaging chips, said Eric R. Fossum, chief scientist at Photobit, who introduced the technology to many of those companies when he was at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. By contrast, he said, when he approached Japanese companies a few years ago, ''the reaction was fairly uniformly uninterested.'' **********That might no longer be the case. Toshiba has become a leader in the new imaging technology. ''We've suddenly got a shot of credibility from Toshiba,'' Peter B. Denyer, chief executive of VLSI, said. **********Matsushita is also working on CMOS imagers that would be combined on a chip with image-compression circuitry, Akira Matsuzawa, a researcher on the project, said. **********Both types of imaging chips have an array of cells representing the individual picture elements, or pixels. When light falls on the surface of the silicon cells, it is converted into an electric charge in proportion to the brightness of the light. **********The problem delivering the signals to a device that reads them. Connecting a wire to each pixel would cover the chip, blocking out the light. And the charges are so weak that they would be obliterated if put on a common wire, called a bus. **********The C.C.D., invented in the late 1960's at Bell Laboratories, solved this problem by transferring the charges from pixel to pixel in an elaborate bucket brigade. But this requires three different voltages and a lot of time and power. **********But with semiconductor features constantly shrinking, it has become possible to put an amplifier inside each picture cell to increase the charge, allowing it to be transferred off the chip on a common wire and making the CMOS approach practical. **********Still, some attempts to develop such sensors have floundered because the images have been poorer in quality and resolution than those captured by C.C.D.'s. A particularly big problem has been noise, which produces unwanted lines or dots on the image. **********So far, CMOS imagers have been used in only a few applications where low cost has been more important than image quality. VLSI Vision's sensor is used in the Kidcam, a black-and-white camcorder for children that is sold by Tyco Toys. **********But now the quality is improving and the chips are starting to advance into mainstream products. **********The Toshiba camera uses a CMOS imaging chip with 330,000 pixels, standard for consumer-level cameras. The camera, which is expected to sell for about $500 in the United States, can be plugged directly into a card slot in a personal computer to transfer the images for display on a monitor. **********The Vivitar Corporation, a camera equipment maker based in Newbury Park, Calif., is introducing a digital still camera using a CMOS imaging chip from VLSI Vision. It will capture 800,000 pixels, the first such camera with that resolution to have a price of less than $500, said Alexis Gerard, publisher of Future Image Report, a Burlingame, Calif., newsletter on digital cameras. **********At a technical conference in February, Toshiba announced that it had developed a CMOS imaging chip containing 1.3 million pixels, the highest resolution now supported by monitors. **********Not everyone is so gung-ho on CMOS imagers. With C.C.D.'s, ''the picture quality is much better than with CMOS image sensors,'' said Nobukazu Teranishi, a senior manager in the sensor research laboratory of the NEC Corporation. **********Sony, which has produced 50 million C.C.D.'s to date and now churns out nearly a million a month, is increasing its manufacturing capacity to meet increased demand. **********A problem for producers of CMOS imagers is the head start that C.C.D. makers have. ''The C.C.D. is very mature technology and they have a very strong marketing capability,'' said Junichi Nakamura, a researcher at the Olympus Optical Company, which has a small research project on CMOS imagers. **********But Vern Klein, who is in charge of selling LSI Logic's new camera chip to digital camera makers, disagreed. ''All our customers believe that CMOS sensors will be the way forward,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/15/business/kodak-sales-and-earnings-continue-to-show-declines.html": {"writer_name": "Claudia Deutsch", "pub_date": "1997-10-15", "snippet": "Eastman Kodak Co says net earnings declined 43.4 percent in third quarter, to $232 million from $410 million a year earlier; sales fell 8 percent, to $3.79 billion from $4.12 billion (L)", "word_count": 663, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kodak Sales and Earnings Continue to Show Declines", "print_headline": "Kodak Sales and Earnings Continue to Show Declines", "body_text": " **********The Eastman Kodak Company, whose digital photography business continues to bleed profusely, said yesterday that its sales and earnings had declined for a second consecutive quarter. **********Kodak said net earnings declined 43.4 percent in the third quarter, to $232 million, or 71 cents a share, from $410 million, or $1.22 a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 8 percent, to $3.79 billion from $4.12 billion. Excluding a onetime charge in the latest quarter, the earnings were equal to 80 cents a share. **********Perhaps most sobering for investors, Kodak's digital division, the area to which Kodak has hitched its future, lost $150 million in the third quarter, as much as it lost in the whole first half of the year. **********The announcement immediately set analysts clamoring for an overhaul of the digital business. ''They have to decide what products they do and don't need,'' said Robert P. Curran of Merrill Lynch. **********Still, the overall results did not faze investors. A month ago, when Kodak warned that its earnings for all of 1997 could be 25 percent below those of 1996, its stock plunged. After that warning, analysts had expected even lower operating earnings for the third quarter -- 74 cents a share, according to a survey by I.B.E.S. International Inc. As a result, Kodak's shares rose $1.125 yesterday, to $64.6875. **********Some of the decline in earnings was attributable to unusual factors. The 9-cent-a-share charge was for an unfavorable appeals court ruling on a monopolistic practices suit. Currency translations accounted for a hit of 20 cents a share. And Kodak's business in writeable compact disks, which turned a tidy profit in the first quarter, racked up losses in the third quarter, when competition drove CD prices from $4 to below $2. **********Also, analysts expect Kodak's losses in the digital division to start dwindling next quarter and to taper off next year. ''They're not losing money because they have bad products, but because their investments in digital haven't paid off yet,'' said Peter J. Enderlin, an analyst with Smith Barney. **********Kodak's film sales, meanwhile, may be looking up. Its main competitor, Fuji Photo Film, imports the film it sells in the United States from the Netherlands, so the strong dollar has helped it keep prices down. Next month, Fuji will start making film in the United States, so this advantage may be lost. **********Kodak's Advantix cameras, hybrid products that use digital and conventional film technology, are starting to sell well after they were reintroduced following sluggish sales. **********All told, while operating profits in Kodak's consumer lines were down about 21 percent from a year earlier, sales stayed flat at $2.075 billion. **********Kodak has also been trying to reduce its costs. The company already has cut 200 management jobs and has promised to cut 10 percent of its lower-level work force before the year is out. And in a conference call with analysts, Harry Kavetas, Kodak's chief financial officer, promised that Kodak would slash costs and prune product lines even more. **********But many analysts worry that the company will not go far enough.

Alexander Henderson, a Prudential Securities analyst who is advising clients to shun the stock. **********Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman & Reid, also said he wanted more Draconian cuts than Kodak might have in mind.

''They've got the lowest sales per employee in the industry, so they've got to get costs down,'' he said. **********Whether Kodak will cut enough to soothe Wall Street fears will become clear on Nov. 11, when Kodak has said it will divulge a restructuring plan. ''The question is not, will they take corrective action, just to what degree,'' said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.

They watch the mighty Germans, the elitist French and the insular British and sometimes get a little sour about being ignored while others drive European affairs. **********So it is with some amusement that the Dutch suddenly find themselves upheld as a model for the rest of Europe. **********In the weeks preceding the meeting of European leaders that begins here on June 16, foreign economists, sociologists and union and political figures have visited seeking to understand what has kept the Netherlands so stable, prosperous and curiously without strikes. **********As Europeans wring their hands over what is usually presented as a choice between heartless American-style modernizing of their economies and preserving the old European social safety nets, many people say the Dutch have found a ''third way'' combining an open, vigorous market with generous social benefits and a measure of social justice. **********Critics point to the high percentage of temporary jobs and social benefits that they say are still too expensive. But for the last five years the Dutch economy has grown faster than those of Britain, France and Germany, and unemployment -- at 6.5 percent -- is well below that of the large European countries. **********The Dutch example has begun to gain wide attention with the approach of next year's deadline for the strict criteria countries must meet if they want to join the common European currency. Countries aspiring to use the currency, called the euro, are in the midst of austerity programs that have led to social unrest and antagonized voters. Leaders at the meeting here are expected to sign an accord aimed at insuring the euro's stability. **********The Dutch say they have invented nothing new by keeping down wages, inflation and interest rates, and by easing the rules for hiring and firing and for opening new businesses. **********But what is different here, often astonishing foreign analysts and investors, is the painstaking consensus building that has avoided social unrest and made wide changes possible. In contrast to the convulsions of bigger neighbors like Britain, France and Spain, the Dutch have worked on avoiding ideological confrontations and for more than a decade have sustained a pact between left and right. As long as unions accepted financial discipline, management has not demanded the dismantling of the welfare state as the price of investing and creating jobs. **********In May, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based research organization of the industrialized nations, noted the Dutch success. It said the country had found a way to tackle unemployment and introduce reforms ''through a consensual process, involving the social partners and clearly not threatening social cohesion.'' **********A recent scene in Amsterdam would have been hard to imagine in London or Paris: the leader of the biggest labor confederation, addressing a workers' congress, declared with passion that it was vital to maintain the strength of the Dutch currency and of the planned European currency. In the front row was the president of the Netherlands central bank, Wim Duisenberg, who applauded, beaming. **********''I might have phrased it a little differently,'' he said afterward, ''but I could sign my name to this.'' **********Such a fraternal scene is not unusual for this country, whose Prime Minister, Wim Kok, was himself a labor leader. **********Now in the spotlight as the host for the European meeting, Mr. Kok has a reputation as a skillful negotiator. He is widely credited as the chief architect of the ''social pact'' between Government, employers and unions that has insured stability. **********As the country's top labor leader, in 1982 he helped launch the pact under which labor federations kept to wage demands of 2 percent per year in exchange for shorter work weeks and more jobs. He stuck to austerity as the Finance Minister from 1989 to 1994, the year he became Prime Minister as leader of a left-right coalition. On a Continent where people are widely disgruntled with politicians, his approval ratings have remained high. **********The Dutch say their achievements have come from tough negotiations.  Cuts in unemployment benefits have pushed people back to work, and the large number of workers calling in sick dropped when new laws shifted the burden of sick pay to employers. As Cees Oudshoorn, an official at the Ministry of Economy put it, ''The Dutch miracle, if it exists at all, is that our labor unions could be convinced to rally around a free-market economy.'' **********Signs of a flourishing market abound. On the outskirts of Amsterdam and around Rotterdam, the world's busiest port, new office parks have drawn foreign companies. Consumers are driving up sales in stores, which only last year got permission to stay open after 6 and on Sundays. **********One telling indicator is the growth of job agencies, which have expanded by 50 percent in the past four years. They advertise a plethora of vacancies in technical jobs, services, sales and health care. **********To draw more people, especially women, into the work force, the Government has deregulated work hours, allowing previously unthinkable part-time and temporary contracts. This has made job agencies into a growth industry, now employing more than 12,000 people. Randstad, the largest temporary help chain, had a staff of 1,600 in 1993 and has 2,800 today. **********''We know where the shortages are, and we help companies plan their work force,'' said Maarten den Ottolander, a Randstad director. ''In the past, temporary jobs could last only six months, but now that they are unlimited, the agencies' role in the market is becoming very big.'' **********One result of the new flexibility is that the Dutch now have Europe's most developed temporary job market. Critics complain that it is a serious weakness that one-third of Dutch jobs are now temporary or part-time. But part-timers still get benefits like vacation and health insurance, and after six months they begin accumulating pension rights. **********Hersta de Goede, in her early 20's, is herself doing temporary work at Randstad and represents the view of many people just out of school. ''I'd prefer to work full-time,'' she said. ''But this is better than no work.'' **********Nicolette Koopman, 23, works three days a week at an Amsterdam bookshop. She said she preferred this to full-time work. ''It gives me time to do other things,'' she said. ''If I need more money, I can get extra odd jobs.'' **********The lively temporary job market seems indeed a boon for young people here, compared with France, where 27 percent of young people are unemployed. But things look worse for workers over 35. Specialists say that the easy-come, easy-go market makes it harder for older employees, because they are more expensive and seen as working less hard. **********Skeptics say the Dutch still have a way to go before all the unaffordable fat from the welfare state is trimmed. Some 800,000 people in a population of 15 million draw disability pay for mild or vague ailments, including ''stress.'' That is 100,000 fewer than three years ago, when the Government tightened the rules. **********Other problems loom. Religious leaders have warned that inequality has risen with the more competitive market. An aging population means that today's benefits may not go on, as workers paying for them become proportionately fewer. **********Yet other Europeans have said that they wish their statistics were as rosy as the Dutch, and that they were as skilled at avoiding political conflict. Whether the Dutch social contract is exportable is unclear. The country has long been governed by coalitions and may be more used to deal-making and compromise than other European countries. **********The endless meetings and debates that come with the Dutch consensus model can seem exasperating to foreign businessmen. But some foreigners note that the lengthy sessions in which the Dutch thrash out ways to live together -- ''a kind of never-ending group therapy,'' in the words of one diplomat -- have recognizable results. The approach has produced a level of trust in the system. **********''It's enough to make politicians in France envious,'' one French resident said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/03/business/futures-markets-oil-surges-on-fear-of-break-in-iraq-and-colombia-supplies.html": {"writer_name": "Bridge News", "pub_date": "1997-10-03", "snippet": "Futures Trading report; crude oil prices surge (M)", "word_count": 358, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oil Surges on Fear of Break In Iraq and Colombia Supplies", "print_headline": "FUTURES MARKETS; Oil Surges on Fear of Break In Iraq and Colombia Supplies", "body_text": " **********Crude oil prices rose to their highest level in four months yesterday because of tensions between Iraq and United Nations weapons inspectors and concern over an impending strike by oil workers in Colombia. **********On other markets, soybeans rose on news of the largest United States weekly export sales in a decade, and copper skidded to a nine-month low on a continued increase in supplies. **********The United Nations said its inspectors were denied access this week to three suspected arms sites in Iraq.

Cambre, chairman of the Newmont Mining Corporation, was prepared for the looming takeover battle. Newmont had survived an assault once before, at the height of the 1980's hostile takeover frenzy, fending off one of the most aggressive corporate raiders, none other than the Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens. **********And now Mr. Cambre had at his side Steven McArthur Heller of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment bank that has long portrayed itself as the defense adviser of choice for targets of hostile bids. **********But this was the 1990's, the era of globalization and finding the right business ''fit.'' Corporate America's view of hostile takeovers had evolved from outraged to indulgent, and so had Mr. Cambre's -- so much so that this time around, he was the predator instead of the prey. At first, his secret merger talks last year with the company he coveted, the Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation, were friendly. But when he realized shortly after Thanksgiving that his would-be partner was planning to break off the engagement and tie the knot with Newmont's rival, the Homestake Mining Company, he turned on Santa Fe with a fury. **********Three months later, he emerged victorious, acquiring Santa Fe for $2.43 billion and creating the biggest gold-mining company in North America. **********''The hostile deals of the 1980's were made by people viewed as bust-up artists and speculators looking for short-term profit,'' said Robert Kindler, a partner at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore who specializes in takeovers. ''The deals today are strategically driven. Companies believe that if they can only achieve their goals through a hostile bid, they're willing to do it.'' **********What a difference a decade makes. In the 1980's, takeover battles were like Wild West shootouts, and descriptions of the strife relied on the imagery of violence: greenmailers and raiders with their bear hugs and Saturday night specials were pitted against white knights and corporate managers who fended off their attackers with poison pills and shark repellent. There was even a famous ''Predators Ball'' to celebrate the mayhem. **********Today, a new respectability reigns in the takeover game. No longer do the likes of Mr. Pickens, Ronald O. Perelman and Carl C. Icahn begin raids with high-risk junk bonds only to carve up their acquisitions and sell off the pieces for a quick profit. Instead, corporations seek to forge ''strategic alliances'' that will enable them to grow and prosper in an increasingly competitive marketplace. And the lexicon of even the most hostile endeavors is filled with sober phrases like synergy, the global marketplace and accretion to earnings. **********And almost everybody, it seems, is doing it. Mainstays of the Fortune 500 like Johnson & Johnson and  I.B.M. began their first hostile takeovers in 1995. In January, the Hilton Hotels Corporation made a $10.5 billion hostile bid for the ITT Corporation, and a month later H. F. Ahmanson & Company, a large savings and loan company on the West Coast, made a $5.9 billion hostile offer for the Great Western Financial Corporation in an attempt to shift toward retail banking. This week, Ahmanson sweetened the bid to $6.6 billion.So far this year, there have been 12 hostile or unsolicited bids, totaling $25 billion. **********Once content to tend their regulated monopoly franchises, utilities and railroads are suddenly conducting their own raucous hostile battles in the wake of deregulation and consolidation. Western Resources Inc. not only won the first hostile takeover in the utility industry last month, but the company hired David C. Wittig, a takeover specialist from Salomon Brothers, to be its president. Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker at Lazard Freres & Company who once likened Mr. Perelman to ''the Huns and the Visigoths'' for his hostile raid on Revlon in 1986, now works with the financier. **********American corporations today have been so thoroughly downsized and restructured that there is little fat for a 1980's-style raider to squeeze out. And junk bonds have mostly dried up as a source of corporate financing. In the 90's, the driving force behind takeovers is the scramble to stay big and strong enough to withstand the twin currents of globalization and deregulation. **********As a result of the more businesslike environment, even the losers in the current crop of takeover battles display a gentility that would have been unthinkable in the 1980's. Jack E. Thompson, chairman of Homestake, for example, took his failure to gain control of Santa Fe with equanimity. **********''In order to compete, there is a critical mass you have to have today,'' Mr. Thompson said matter-of-factly. ''It was a reasonable reaction for Newmont to try and grab Santa Fe by any means. I was a little set back by some of the subsequent comments. All in all, I thought it was pretty professional, but not a pleasant thing to go through.'' In fact, he added, ''I can see circumstances where we might end up in a hostile bid.'' **********Wayne W. Murdy, executive vice president of Newmont, had no hard feelings, either. ''We felt that the synergies between our companies were so strong that we wanted the opportunity to take our story to the Santa Fe shareholders,'' he said. **********With a rising stock market, corporations are well financed for such deals. At the same time, investors are playing one of the raiders' old roles -- prodding chief executives to increase earnings. When revenues are flat, many corporate chiefs now look to combine with similar businesses in order to dominate markets and cut costs by eliminating overlapping operations. **********No industry is immune from the new merger fervor. Last year, the Dayton Hudson Corporation withdrew from an attempted $6.9 billion takeover of the J. C. Penney Company after Penney rejected the offer, but both companies, as well as the the Kmart Corporation, remain prime targets of other expansion-minded retailers, in the view of some investment bankers. With convergence in vogue in the rapidly deregulating utility industry, nearly any natural-gas company is a potential target for an electric utility hoping to grow and survive into the next century. **********In finance, banks and insurance companies that want to invade Wall Street have increasingly been looking at companies from Paine Webber Group Inc. to the American Express Company as potential takeover targets, friendly or otherwise. In a possible prelude to a takeover attempt, the Bank of New York Company announced earlier this year that it would try to increase its stake in the State Street Boston Corporation after merger talks between the two companies had failed. **********And Newmont Mining's conquest of Santa Fe has only fueled speculation that more takeover activity may be at hand in the gold-mining industry, with both the Battle Mountain Gold Company in Houston and Getchell Gold Corporation in Englewood, Colo., considered as prime candidates. **********Yet all this activity draws little of the outrage vented at the swashbuckling raiders of a decade ago. John E. Hayes Jr., chairman of Western Resources, drew little criticism for breaking a vow he made five years ago not to be ''involved in hostile takeover activity'' when he started not one but two takeover bids last year -- one for the Kansas City Power and Light Company and the other for ADT Inc., the giant home-security company. Has corporate America been worn down -- or co-opted? ''The new respectability is really a product of the shift from financial transactions to strategic transactions and a shift in the nature of the bidders,'' said Martin Lipton, a partner with the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which that specializes in corporate takeovers and invented the poison pill defense. ''When you have I.B.M. and Johnson & Johnson doing it, you're hard pressed to say it's not respectable.'' **********Certainly, executives at the International Business Machines Corporation thought they had no other choice in 1995 but to begin their first hostile raid on the Lotus Development Corporation, an event that also marked the first hostile takeover in the software industry. With consolidation afoot in the industry, it had become increasingly important for computer manufacturers to forge direct links with software companies or risk being held captive to a competitor. **********Lawrence Ricciardi, general counsel to I.B.M., acknowledged that the company had some trepidation about a takeover attempt, particularly when Lotus's greatest asset -- its employees -- might flee from an ugly dogfight. So, the company issued a $10.3 billion bid, high enough to be taken seriously on Wall Street and at Lotus, and honed a story of how well matched the two companies were to assuage the fears of Lotus employees. **********''We had had conversations with Lotus and weren't able to persuade them to make a deal with us,'' said Mr. Ricciardi, a veteran, like Louis V. Gerstner Jr., I.B.M.'s chief executive, of RJR Nabisco in its shell-shocked, post-takeover days. ''We were concerned that if we kept pushing them on a friendly basis, we might drive them into the arms of a third party. The only surprise in the end was that it was the shortest hostile deal to turn into a negotiated transaction, only seven days.'' **********The recent bidding war for Conrail Inc., the Philadelphia-based railroad that had a virtual monopoly over rail freight in the Northeast, by the CSX Corporation of Richmond and the Norfolk Southern Corporation of Norfolk, Va., was also driven by a fear of being left behind in an expanding market. Conrail agreed this month to a $10.3 billion deal that would split the railroad between the two suitors. **********To be sure, hostile takeover attempts still represent a minority of the record-breaking number of mergers today. According to the Securities Data Company, there were 73 hostile or unsolicited bids announced in 1996 and 97 in 1995, with a combined value of $155 billion. In 1988, however, there were 168 hostile bids valued at a total of $222 billion. **********''It's still very hard to accomplish a hostile deal, even though it's clear there is no longer a stigma attached to doing one,'' Mr. Kindler of Cravath Swaine said. ''The courts have become more favorable to target companies, and you have to be certain when you start a hostile bid that there is no other company in the world that is willing to pay more.'' **********John Gutfreund, the former chairman of Salomon Brothers, offers a rare voice of caution, suggesting that mergers that appear to make sense today because of rising stock prices could backfire if the economy turns sour. ''Shareholders, particularly institutional shareholders, want to get the fastest possible large return and that, in effect, endorses behavior that was previously considered unclub-like,'' Mr. Gutfreund said. ''The deal makers cut the cloth to fit the fashion.'' **********And Mr. Rohatyn notes that for all the difference in style between the current spate of mergers and those of the 1980's, both tend to result in mass layoffs. ''It is a social issue,'' he said, that is still festering.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/04/business/executive-changes-909858.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********CWT SPECIALTY STORES INC., South Attleboro, Mass., which operates 51 Cherry & Webb retail stores in New England, named the former chairman of R.

And, mixed in with that, the numbing guilt that we, with our voracious appetite for ownership of the \"People's Princess,\" are somehow implicated in her end. All these emotions will be translated into concrete action in the following weeks and months: the funeral and public mourning; a desire to protect the motherless princes; an urge to give continuing support to the princess's issues and causes, and a debate about unacceptable intrusion into the private lives of public figures. **********But the death of the Princess Superstar, apparently on the cusp of an emotional tranquillity that had thus far eluded her, has a deeper resonance. It offers neither a fairy tale with an unhappy ending nor a morality play with obvious heroes and villains, but rather a Greek tragedy rescripted for modern times. **********The princess had long since passed from being part of the royal pageant \u2014 its scintillating and its darker side \u2014 to reach iconic status. She was up there with the figures that the world knows on first-name terms: Elvis, Jackie or Marilyn, who, like Diana, was 36 years old when the reality of her life was enshrined in myth. **********In her transformation from the traditionally passive and pretty princess to active world figure, Diana had also become symbolic of the power of modern woman to steer her destiny. **********While men often (openly or privately) sympathized with Prince Charles when the princess went public about her rotten marriage, women cheered her on. She deliberately took the dangerous decision to move her life into the fast lane \u2014 not just with her penchant for jet-set life over the stuffiness of the royal court, but in her willingness to bare her soul about her emotions, her bulimia and the infidelities of her husband and herself. **********Her critics will see in this a streak of self-destructiveness that foreshadowed the tragic ending. **********If Diana's story reads like a soap opera, she contributed to the screenplay. By so obviously enjoying her cover-girl status, and inviting the world to share the roller-coaster ride of her personal life, she became the ultimate celebrity symbol of a media-saturated age. **********Diana was, in fact, the first media-savvy royal, a television princess who honed her image to the small screen rather than the big crowd. **********Queen Elizabeth had, it is true, invented the idea of the royal \"walkabout,\" but her dignity and restraint put a glass wall between herself and her subjects. **********Diana became master of the one-on-one encounter \u2014 not just with the sick and distressed, but also with a face drawn from the crowd. And while this made great television and newspaper pictures, it also had an enormous popular impact. **********From the reaching out, literal and figurative, grew Diana's role as a quasi-saintly figure, whose way of communicating with the old, the young, the victims of AIDS or land-mine injuries, crossed barriers of age and language. Instead of the post-Victorian royal image of a family steeped in bourgeois values overlaid with pomp and circumstance, Diana appeared to be reinventing earlier mystical concepts of kingship, when the \"laying on of hands\" was part of any royal progress. **********In an age when conventional religion is often abandoned or deemed inadequate, this \"Diana-worship\" fulfilled a need. **********And whereas it might have seemed mawkish or weird, people believed in Diana because she was so obviously searching for answers for herself. Her unhappy marriage and its aftermath were filled with visits to psychics, psychoanalysts, faith healers and clairvoyants (most recently with Dodi al Fayed, who was killed in the same accident). **********Diana therefore became not one of \"them\" \u2014 a distant royal with a gracious interest in ordinary folk \u2014 but one of \"us.\" **********In every facet of her life, she appeared to mirror the norm in the late 20th century \u2014 especially for her gender. **********She was a tireless mother who turned out to have come from a dysfunctional family. People saw her hugging her kids and remembered the story of how her own childhood was haunted by the memory of her mother's departing footsteps crunching down the drive. **********From \"Shy Di,\" whose sweet side-long glance made her look like a startled fawn, she morphed into a business person and working mom, whose causes were big issues in which she proved that one person could make a difference. **********Her time off was also like that of ordinary folk. Ignoring royal etiquette, the princess threw herself into races at the children's school sports days. Her vacations were not behind castle walls, but a glamorized sun-and-sand version of other people's holidays. **********She was venerated for her extraordinary, charismatic beauty, elegance and style \u2014 but then revealed that her exterior was as much a facade as her fairy-tale romance with the Prince of Wales. Then she rebuilt her body and her confidence at the gym, as though to prove that glamour is something that any woman can aspire to. **********Even her revelations about her love affair with James Hewitt and her recent flaunting of an intimate relationship can be seen as a mirror image of the \"girl power\" that dominates the 1990s. **********Diana's presentation of herself as a sexual being was an affirmation of the reality of modern women's lives \u2014 the diametric opposite of the image of the innocent and virginal princess sacrificed on the altar of royal conformity in her 1981 marriage. **********How much of all Diana's life was about manipulation through the media to feed the fantasies of an adoring public? In recent weeks, comparisons drawn between Diana's relationship with the playboy Mr. al Fayed and Jackie Kennedy's relationship with Aristotle Onassis suggest that people were not entirely happy with this picture-perfect romance. **********By turning so much of her life into a photo op, she reaped the bad harvest of complicity with the media. **********Yet the princess, even stripped of her official royal status, had still seemed the best hope of the monarchy for giving itself a purpose, a position and above all a coherent image in the modern world. The reaction of the royal family to her death \u2014 its ability to express the emotional grief of the public \u2014 may determine its status and even its survival. **********When the young Queen Elizabeth II came to the throne in 1953, symbolizing the hope of renewal in a postwar world, her prime minister, Winston Churchill, called her \"a flash of color on the hard road we have to travel.\" He said, \"We don't know how lucky we are to have her.\" **********In Britain and the wider world, most ordinary people would echo those sentiments about Diana and feel that a light is extinguished with her death."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/02/business/key-rates-399175.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/13/business/business-digest-610275.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 535, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********American Airlines Cancels Some Overseas Flights **********American Airlines canceled most of its Friday night overseas flights as a strike deadline set by the pilots' union loomed. **********President Clinton urged the carrier and the pilots to resolve through mediation a dispute that he said ''has huge implications for our country.'' $(Page A1.$) **********The dispute seems to be over issues, like wage increases, that might be resolved relatively easily.

''For an attractive price, we are going to greatly increase the geographic diversity of our newspaper division through the addition of five mid-sized markets in the vibrant Texas economy, plus one growth market in South Carolina.'' **********The price Scripps will pay for the properties depends on the outcome of Federal legislation, introduced last month, to restrict the tax-free sale of assets under a so-called Morris Trust structure.

The Korean currency, the won, dropped to 1,623 to the dollar, compared with its previous close of 1,481 won. **********The reaction stems partly from fears that Mr. Kim, a liberal populist with strong support from organized labor, might resist fulfilling the agreement South Korea made with the International Monetary Fund for the $57 billion rescue of the South Korean economy. **********The I.M.F. agreement will result in the opening of Korea's markets to foreign products and investors, something Mr. Kim has been wary of in the past. The agreement is also likely to cause widespread unemployment as money-losing banks and other failing businesses are closed. **********In a speech and news conference this morning, the President-elect tried to reassure foreign investors and lenders, whose decisions will largely determine if South Korea defaults on foreign debt held by its banks and corporations. **********''I will thoroughly implement a free market economy,'' Mr. Kim said. ''I will boldly open the market. I will make it so that foreign investors can invest with confidence.'' **********But while Mr. Kim said he would ''diligently carry out the I.M.F. terms,'' he added that he would ''continuously negotiate with the I.M.F. regarding minor and specific problems,'' in order to minimize job losses and bankruptcies. **********Mr. Kim, who heads the largest opposition party, had said during the campaign that he would renegotiate the I.M.F. agreement. When such comments scared foreign investors, leading to sharp drops in stock prices and the won, he reversed himself and embraced the accord. **********But some business executives fear that Mr. Kim is not consistent in his policies, aggravating uncertainty that already clouds the economic outlook. By contrast, Lee Hoi Chang, the candidate of the ruling Grand National Party, is considered much more predictable. **********Another concern is that Mr. Kim and his party, the National Congress for New Politics, do not control the National Assembly, which will convene next week to pass reform laws required by the I.M.F. Although the assembly's majority is held by the Grand National Party, political deadlocks could impede the reform. **********Moreover, Mr. Kim will not formally take power until Feb. 25.

Scott, a deal maker who built the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, the country's biggest for-profit hospital chain, appears close to resigning as chairman and chief executive. **********The Columbia/HCA board was meeting last night in Nashville, where the company is based, to decide strategy on dealing with an array of Government fraud investigations, which have depressed Columbia share prices, and a takeover discussion with the Tenet Healthcare Corporation, the second-largest investor-owned hospital chain. **********Mr. Scott's take-no-prisoners business style, and success in stitching together 340 hospitals and 570 home health care centers -- which is the country's largest home health network -- has provoked a backlash of opposition among doctors, hospital executives and state attorneys general across the country. **********People who are eager for the Tenet deal, which would create a juggernaut of about 475 hospitals and $30 billion in revenue, hope that banishing Mr. Scott could open the door to settling the various fraud investigations. Government officials have declined to discuss their plans or possible outcomes. **********A person involved in the negotiations between the two companies said he had learned that Mr. Scott would be out by the end of the week. Asked about this, the company declined to comment on the report but did not deny it. Mr. Scott could not be reached for comment. **********Agents from half a dozen Federal agencies are working on the Columbia/HCA investigation. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said last week that 35 search warrants had been served in seven states -- Florida, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Utah, Oklahoma and Georgia -- on hospitals now or formerly owned by Columbia and two companies doing business with the chain. **********The investigators have sifted records from at least 50 Columbia hospitals and raised questions about Medicare billings for services by doctors, recruitment of physicians, referrals to home health agencies and blood laboratory work. **********Mr. Scott, a health care lawyer originally from Kansas, was picked out of obscurity by Richard Rainwater, the Fort Worth financier, to head the company. Mr. Scott owns about 1.4 percent of Columbia shares, according to company filings in March; those would be valued at $340 million at yesterday's closing price of $36.25, down 6.25 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Merger negotiations with Tenet, which have been intermittent for more than a year and were disclosed in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, are snagged on the difficulty of valuing Columbia. It is virtually impossible to know whether or how much Columbia/HCA might have to pay to settle with the Government. **********''They've got to find a way to get the value up to the $40 range for Tenet shareholders,'' Dan Cain, a health care investment banker, said of the stock price, ''and invent a creative way so the Tenet shareholders are not buying into a bottomless pit.'' **********Mr. Cain, who advised nonprofit hospitals in a number of deals with Columbia, suggested that Tenet stockholders could be given ''a warrant or contingent note'' with a value that would vary depending on the size of the settlement, ''if it's a $500 million penalty, if it's a $750 million penalty, and so on.'' **********Tenet had its origins in National Medical Enterprises, a much smaller hospital chain that paid $379 million in 1994 to settle Federal and state charges involving fraud and abuses of psychiatric patients, and several hundred million dollars more to insurance companies and individuals. Jeffrey C. Barbakow, the chairman and chief executive of Tenet, had been a National Medical Enterprises board member who was brought in to clean up the mess and settle with the Government. **********While the combined hospitals of Columbia and Tenet would be less than 15 percent of the country's hospitals, their dominance in Texas and southern Florida might well raise antitrust issues. **********Columbia has 25 hospitals in southern and southwestern Florida, and Tenet has 11. In Houston, which has roughly 40 hospitals, Columbia operates eight acute-care hospitals and Tenet runs five. And of the nine hospitals in El Paso, Columbia has four and Tenet has two. **********Jeffrey C. Villwock, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey, said there would be ''serious antitrust problems in Florida,'' among other places. **********The Columbia chain, which started out small in Texas and South Florida, vaulted to the top when Mr. Scott and Mr. Rainwater negotiated mergers with groups of hospitals formerly operated by Humana Inc., HCA and Healthtrust. **********Thomas N. Frist, whose family started the Hospital Corporation of America, the parent of HCA and Healthtrust, owns 14.6 million shares, or 2.2 percent of Columbia, now valued at $529 million. Mr. Frist, a career hospital executive, is said to be displeased by Mr. Scott's aggressive operating style. **********Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said Mr. Frist, who is a Columbia board member, might be given the role of negotiating with the Government. Other analysts said that Mr. Frist could become interim chief executive following a removal of Mr. Scott. **********Mr. Barbakow, chairman of Tenet, would be expected to head the combined company, if the deal goes through. **********''There are three parties at the table,'' said Margo Vignola, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company, ''Columbia, Tenet and the Federal Government.'' **********Mr. Cain, the investment banker, said that Mr. Scott had brought new life to for-profit hospital stocks, which were ''languishing on Wall Street'' when he bought his first hospitals in El Paso. ''But he expanded in such an antagonistic style that the Government, the payers, the physicians and the not-for-profit hospitals are completely focused on him as the Darth Vader of the industry,'' Mr. Cain said. **********''What Wall Street wants,'' Mr. Cain added, ''is a softer, gentler investor ownership model, which can get on with the consolidation of the health care industries but without all this controversial byproduct.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/07/world/mexico-finds-body-but-then-wonders-is-it-top-drug-boss.html": {"writer_name": "Sam Dillon", "pub_date": "1997-07-07", "snippet": "Mexico tentatively identifies body of man who died in Mexico City hospital after facial surgery and liposuction as billionaire drug trafficker Amado Carrillo Fuentes; Mexican anti-drug agents, who once seemed sluggish in prosecuting Carrillo Fuent...", "word_count": 1050, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico Finds Body But Then Wonders: Is It Top Drug Boss?", "print_headline": "Mexico Finds Body But Then Wonders: Is It Top Drug Boss?", "body_text": " **********In what appears to be a macabre final chapter for one of the hemisphere's premier pulp fiction figures, the Government said today that ''there are indications'' that a man who died here after facial surgery and midriff liposuction was Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the billionaire drug trafficker. **********The announcement came during a transcontinental pursuit of the body, in which Mexican anti-drug agents, who once seemed sluggish in prosecuting the drug trafficker, aggressively chased his presumed cadaver. **********They trailed the body from a hospital here to a funeral parlor in the state of Sinaloa, where they seized it by judicial order and shipped it back to Mexico City for a battery of autopsies and D.N.A. tests. **********The Government said it could not confirm the death of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes ''with total certainty.'' But Thomas A. Constantine, the director of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, said in a telephone interview from Washington that the Mexican authorities had matched the body's fingerprints with those of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes and that American agents had been allowed to view the body. **********''I would say that this has believability,'' Mr. Constantine said. ''I'd rather have him alive to find out all he knew, but this is the second-best option.'' **********Mr. Carrillo Fuentes was an entrepreneur in the $10-billion-a-year business of smuggling South American cocaine and other drugs through Mexico into cities across the United States. **********In recent years he consolidated under his influence Mexico's entire drug underworld, except for one murderous rival gang, the Arellano Felix family of Tijuana, and had even begun to dominate in his relations with Colombian suppliers. **********Mexican and United States officials said his apparent death would destabilize narcotics relationships across the continent. Several officials suggested that his younger brother Vicente would try to take his place. But a fierce battle for succession could break out among his lieutenants and competitors trying to muscle into his organization. **********Mr. Carrillo Fuentes, whose age has been given as 41 or 42 -- authorities have found two birth certificates -- rose to vast wealth in the 1980's but remained an obscure figure until 1994, when he earned the nickname ''Lord of the Skies'' by having multi-ton cocaine loads flown to Mexico from Colombia in converted commercial jetliners. Except for a brief detention in 1989 and despite his indictment in Miami and Dallas on charges of smuggling heroin, marijuana and cocaine, Mr. Carrillo Fuentes avoided arrest here, moving freely between his mother's home in Sinaloa, the northern cities that were his major operational centers and his sprawling haciendas and penthouse apartments elsewhere. **********Mr. Carrillo Fuentes spent his billions freely, buying protection from senior Mexican law enforcement officials and politicians, including two state Governors, United States officials say. In February, Mexico's top anti-drug official, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was arrested on charges of putting his entire central Mexican command of 38,000 troops at the trafficker's service. **********Mr. Carrillo Fuentes operated a sophisticated intelligence operation, using computerized scanners to eavesdrop on hundreds of phone lines. He appeared to have enlisted General Gutierrez's cooperation largely by offering reconnaissance information on rivals. **********But there seems to have been a drastic change in his life in the weeks before General Gutierrez's arrest. **********Mr. Carrillo Fuentes barely escaped capture by a 300-troop force of soldiers that raided his mother's ranch at Guamuchilito, a village outside Culiacan in Sinaloa, and soon he became a full-time fugitive. **********The Drug Enforcement Administration has received unconfirmed reports in recent months that he has been in Russia, Cuba and South America, Mr. Constantine said. **********Although a consensus seemed to  form that Mr. Carrillo Fuentes is dead, some remained skeptical. ''I wouldn't believe it until there's absolutely foolproof positive identification,'' said one senior United States official. ''It sounds like a cheap novel. A man dies after having plastic surgery. He walks away with a new name, a new face, a new stomach. It just seems too cute.'' **********The reports of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's death began to circulate on Friday. Government agents began investigating them on Saturday, a statement issued today by Mexico's Attorney General's office said. **********The agents found that a man identifying himself as Antonio Flores Montes, 42, checked into the Santa Monica Hospital in the upper-class Polanco district here on Thursday, listing a false address, ''to submit himself to procedures of liposuction and extensive facial surgery.'' **********The surgery lasted eight hours, the statement said, after which the patient was moved to a recovery area and later to a private room. At 6 A.M. Friday, a duty physician found him dead in his bed, and the hospital filled out a death certificate listing heart failure as the cause. **********Early Saturday, the body, identified as that of Mr. Flores, was put aboard an Aeromexico flight by a Mexico City mortuary and shipped to Culiacan, where it was transferred to a funeral home, the statement said. **********By that time, word of the reported death had made its way into Sinaloa newspapers, and hundreds of weeping relatives and gunmen were converging at his mother's Guamuchilito ranch. Later on Saturday, Mexican drug agents seized and examined the body and checked its fingerprints, the statement said. **********The Government statement did not report the result of the fingerprint exam, but Mr. Constantine said it had provided a positive identification of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes. **********On Saturday evening, the trafficker's mother, Aurora Fuentes Lopez, visited the Culiacan mortuary. She emerged minutes later and told reporters, ''Yes, it's my son.'' **********Early today, the body was flown again to Mexico City for further tests. The Government promised to allow Michael Garland, the D.E.A.'s attache in Mexico, to view the body, Mr. Constantine said. **********Nonetheless, there was continuing skepticism, reflecting a recent stream of somewhat baroque official statements here, including the breathless announcement by Mexico's Attorney General that a skeleton unearthed at the bidding of a fortune teller was the body of a Congressman wanted for questioning in a murder trial. The story was a complete charade. **********But in Guamuchilito, scores of grieving relatives continued to trudge into the family ranch today. **********It is uncertain whether Mr. Carrillo Fuentes's brother will be able to take his place. ''Vicente doesn't have the juice,'' said a former American drug official with experience in Mexico. ''He doesn't have the respect that his brother commanded. He may try to step in, but others will say, 'You're not your brother. We're not going to follow.' So there'll probably be some little wars.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/16/business/newest-bre-x-suit-will-seek-101-million.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-10-16", "snippet": "Court in Calgary, Alberta, permits shareholder lawsuit to proceed against officials of Bre-X Minerals Ltd, to reclaim profits they made by selling shares before company collapsed in gold-discovery fraud earlier this year; suit names company's chie...", "word_count": 269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Newest Bre-X Suit Will Seek $101 Million", "print_headline": "Newest Bre-X Suit Will Seek $101 Million", "body_text": " **********A court here today permitted a shareholder lawsuit to proceed against officials of Bre-X Minerals Ltd. to reclaim profits they made by selling shares before the company collapsed in a gold-discovery fraud earlier this year. **********Lawyers for the shareholders said the planned suit, which will name the company's chief executive, David G.

Lie down on any bed outside of the major international hotels and discover how short a mattress can be. And if you are over 6 feet tall, don't even think about buying clothes off store racks here; they won't fit. **********The esthetic value placed on compactness has long been enshrined in the famous wooden sculpture of the prevailing ethnic group in this part of West Africa, the Akan, who sculpt muscular carved couples of men and women in a squatting posture, almost as if to emphasize their shortness. **********And while Ghanaians are almost unfailingly friendly, in a society where an average adult male stands  about 5 feet 8 inches, it is not a place where a 6-foot-4-inch foreign journalist can expect to work without drawing stares. **********''When we were in school we were always forced to sit in the back,'' said Godwin Kuadey, a broad-shouldered, booming-voiced 6-foot-7-inch man who is now chief superintendent of the Ghanaian police. ''If you ever sat anywhere else, people would complain you are blocking their view. On the playground, when we played volleyball, people would tease me, calling me the pole.'' **********In a country where some regions lack clean water or electricity, where hunger and illiteracy afflict many, Mr. Kuadey's complaint may seem trivial, but it is serious enough to the members who have sought comforting solidarity in the Tall Men's Club of Ghana. **********The association aims, say members like the police superintendent, to defend the rights of this country's least-known oppressed minority: the few who tower over the many. **********For the 65 or so members over 6 feet tall who banded together to form the club a year ago, the handicaps of being statuesque in the land of the squat range from the mundane difficulties of finding shoes that fit to discrimination against tall people in the workplace. **********Most of all, though, the group aims to give its members, who have gone from being awkward wallflowers at teen-age parties to uncomfortable standouts in crowded office elevators, the self-confidence to get over what many say has been a crippling shyness and get on with their lives. **********''To be a tall person can be quite embarrassing, especially for a lot of younger guys,'' said Sammy Dodoo,  33, a manager at a telecommunications company here who is 6 feet 4 inches tall. **********''This society does everything it can to remind you that you are too tall. The result is that lots of tall people feel shy about asserting themselves, or even coming out.'' **********Although Ghana's Tall Men's Club organizes regular fund-raisers for charity work, operates an agricultural cooperative that hopes to become a big exporter of tropical produce, and provides volunteers for good works like cleaning up the grounds of the state hospital, the primary focus of the monthly meetings it holds in Accra's Y.M.C.A. seems to be making its members feel more secure about themselves. **********''Our biggest preoccupation is to improve the social and financial well-being of our members,'' said Joseph Mensah, 50, a founder of the club, who at 6-feet-2 is one of its shortest members. **********''We can't do this until we have begun to make people feel proud of themselves. So we have adopted a motto that tells our members it is not enough to be tall, you must also be outstanding.'' **********The idea for the club came to him, Mr. Mensah said, when his teen-age daughter remarked that her father always seemed to surround himself with tall people, starting with his own family. **********Like most every member, Mr. Mensah, who is a civil engineer, said  he remembers the teasing of classmates over long legs that wouldn't fit under his school desk or between the tightly spaced seats of the city's ramshackle buses. **********''When kids are playing soccer no one wants you on their team because you are so tall,'' he said. ''When you are standing in a crowd, the short people start to jeer you, telling you that you are too tall, that you should get back. When boys start dating, everyone makes fun of you because of your height.'' **********As their first political effort, Ghana's tall men are seeking to change official standards in building codes and procurement of office furniture more suitable for tall people. **********The drive takes its inspiration from tall men's crusades in places like Belgium and the Netherlands, where, Mr. Mensah said, similar organizations have had some successes in winning concessions. **********Not everyone shares the sense of tall Ghanaians as put upon. In a quick poll of Ghanaian women met in the streets of this city on a recent afternoon, few could understand why tall men would feel shy or unwanted. **********''Where are all these tall men, and what is their problem?'' asked Abla Amoakwa, 26, a single woman who works as a secretary. ''Every woman I know would prefer to go out with a tall man. The problem is that there just aren't any here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/03/world/zaire-negotiations-collapse-as-rebel-balks-on-security.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1997-05-03", "snippet": "Diplomatic efforts to bring together Zaire Pres Mobutuo Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila for talks fall through after day of relentless confusion, after Kabila refuses to fly to offshore vessel for security reasons; Mobutu, who has advanc...", "word_count": 1005, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zaire Negotiations Collapse as Rebel Balks on Security", "print_headline": "Zaire Negotiations Collapse as Rebel Balks on Security", "body_text": " **********After a day of relentless confusion, diplomatic efforts to bring President Mobutu Sese Seko and the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, together for shipboard talks fell through this evening when Mr. Kabila stood up his rival, refusing to fly to the vessel for security reasons. **********Mr. Kabila's decision came after the meeting, which was expected to transfer power between the two men, had been delayed for several hours by Mr. Mobutu and an elaborate improvisation over how to get the ailing Zairian President on board. **********Mr. Mobutu, who is suffering from advanced cancer and is unable to stand up unassisted, arrived this morning at Pointe-Noire, a Congolese port, but refused to walk up a steep 31-step gangplank to the ship, sending diplomats and his hosts scurrying to devise other solutions. He also refused to board the ship by helicopter, invoking advice from his doctors that the vibrations could harm him. **********After considering even using a crane to hoist Mr. Mobutu aboard, the ship was maneuvered so he could be driven up a cargo plank in an armored black Cadillac as he waved through dark windows to journalists. **********It was not clear if Mr. Kabila planned to travel to the ship on Saturday, when diplomats hoped to reconvene. Reports from Luanda, the Angolan capital, where the rebel leader spent much of the day, said that Mr. Kabila was complaining he had not been officially invited to the meetings and that he was concerned about his safety. **********But diplomats here said Mr. Kabila appeared to get cold feet out of fear that the discussions would require him to form a government not entirely of his choosing. **********The United States has expressed its desire to see a ''broadly inclusive transitional government'' that could contain members of both Mr. Mobutu's political movement and Zaire's traditional opposition, which the rebel leader has resisted. **********Tensions were high today in Kinshasa, the Zairian capital, a crowded city of five million, where many feared that word the talks had failed could lead to a panic by Government soldiers, who would then expect an imminent rebel assault. **********Already the capital's leading hotels have been filling up with wealthy Zairians worried about a possible repeat of violent bouts of pillaging by Government soldiers in 1991 and 1993, which took numerous lives and left much of the city in ruins. **********''This is what these talks are all about, avoiding the burning of Kinshasa,'' said one Western diplomat. ''Kabila is coming one way or another. But hopefully it won't have to be with guns blazing.'' **********The breakdown of talks even before they had begun left Mr. Mobutu, President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and President Clinton's special envoy, Bill Richardson, steaming off the Congolese port aboard the Outeniqua, the South African icebreaker chosen as a neutral meeting place. **********In Washington, Administration officials expressed disappointment and annoyance with Mr. Kabila.  ''The U.S. Government is very disappointed, and Kabila's refusal to show is directly contradictory to all the assurances he gave Richardson,'' one official said. ''It just doesn't go over very well.'' **********Many had wondered whether Mr. Mobutu's health would allow him to negotiate at all with Mr. Kabila, the rebel leader whose armies control over two-thirds of Zaire and are now advancing on the capital. **********From their conception, the talks between Mr. Mobutu and Mr. Kabila, an idea worked upon for weeks by Mr. Mandela, and pushed strongly during Mr. Richardson's shuttle diplomacy of the last few days, have been plagued by strong disagreements over an agenda. **********Even as Mr. Kabila was waiting for Mr. Mobutu to board the ship, before setting out to join him, his troops, heavily assisted by Angola, have been massing around Kinshasa poised to strike quickly if Mr. Mobutu refuses to resign. **********Advanced elements of Mr. Kabila's army are now believed to be little more than 100 miles east of Kinshasa, and Western intelligence reports indicated that rebel units were massing to the southwest of the capital, near the Angolan border with Bas-Zaire province. **********In addition, rebel units were said to be fast moving into position to attack the capital from Tshikapa to the southeast, also near the border with Angola. **********As if to drive home the point that Mr. Mobutu's political end is at hand, the rebels announced today that they had taken the President's birthplace, the northern city of Lisala, without a fight from Government troops, who looted the town before fleeing. **********Though widely believed to be nearing death, Mr. Mobutu has been fighting for a departure that would allow him to hand over power with dignity to an interim authority, rather than to Mr. Kabila directly. **********Deepening the air of uncertainty, close associates of the Mobutu family have said that whether or not the President agrees on anything with Mr. Kabila, his health will not allow him to come back after the talks. The fortunes and leverage of the two sides were reflected today by their supporting casts. Mr. Kabila spent hours meeting in Luanda, Angola, with his two biggest backers, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and Vice President Paul Kagame of Rwanda. **********Rwanda committed officers, equipment and troops at the earliest stages of Mr. Kabila's uprising, and Western diplomats say Angola has contributed large amounts of cash in recent weeks, as well as tanks and other heavy weapons, and airlift capacity for moving troops around the vast Zairian countryside. **********Asked what the involvement of the outside countries was about, a member of Mr. Richardson's delegation said, ''Payback, payback, and in Angola's case, diamonds.'' **********Mr. Mobutu has had a large hand in the civil wars of both Rwanda and Angola, and Zaire's support for Angola's rebel movement enabled its leader, Jonas Savimbi, to control most of the border between the two countries, and Angola's lucrative diamond trade. **********Mr. Mobutu had hoped to bring at least two fellow African heads of state, Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and President Omar Bongo of Gabon, aboard the Outeniqua for moral and political support. But when Mr. Kabila got wind of this, he reportedly threatened to pull out of the discussions, and the plan to bring in other leaders was canceled."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/09/business/dow-surges-103.82-points-to-7962.31.html": {"writer_name": "David Barboza", "pub_date": "1997-07-09", "snippet": "Dow Jones industrial average surges 103.82 points, or 1.32 percent, to close at record 7,962.31; Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rises 6.55 points, to record 918.75, and Nasdaq composite index increases 14.36 points, to record 1,485.10; Russell ...", "word_count": 643, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Surges 103.82 Points, to 7,962.31", "print_headline": "Dow Surges 103.82 Points, to 7,962.31", "body_text": " **********The stock market soared to record levels again yesterday on growing optimism about corporate profits and a stable economy. **********Despite persistent concerns about lofty valuations, investors continue to bid up share prices to the surprise of many on Wall Street. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 23 percent in just over six months, surged 103.82 points, or 1.32 percent, to 7,962.31.

Mr. Clinton emphasized that strengthening Japan economically was crucial to restoring stability across Asia. **********''We just want to be in a position to be supportive when we can,'' Mr. Clinton said.

Berger, his national security adviser. ''In the new information world, provisions need to be made for people who move to the beat of a different drummer.'' **********Asked how Mr. Suharto responded, Mr. Berger said he ''did not respond to that directly.'' **********The sessions dominated the first of two days of meetings among the leaders of the 18 members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. While Mr. Clinton and his counterparts from other nations continued to stress the region's resiliency and underlying strengths, their conversations here were tinged by deep concern that the financial turmoil had not yet been brought under control and could still permanently tarnish its standing as a driving force in the global economy. **********Administration officials dismissed concerns that Japan could follow South Korea as the next country to need an international financial bailout. But they said the situation warranted acute international attention to prevent a further spread of instability. They said finance ministers from many of the affected nations would meet in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, next week and again in Japan in January. **********''My view is that we should approach this with determination, but with confidence,'' Mr. Clinton said. **********Administration officials said the Asian leaders Mr. Clinton met with all endorsed the American-backed strategy for dealing with the crisis. **********The strategy calls for the International Monetary Fund to take the lead role in dealing with any countries that need international financial assistance. It also allows countries in a region to put together backup pools of financial help if I.M.F. assistance proves insufficient. And it calls on nations to enact more prudent economic policies in return for receiving international assistance. **********Hanging heavy over today's proceedings was the failure of Japan's fourth-largest securities firm, Yamaichi Securities Company. It was the second failure of a major financial institution in Japan in recent weeks, and it heightened concerns that Asia's spreading woes could lead to further failures among Japan's beleaguered banks and set back Japan's already faltering efforts to spur its economy. **********American officials said Mr. Hashimoto did not provide Mr. Clinton with any details of his plans to deal with the banking crisis beyond emphasizing protection of depositors rather than financial institutions. But Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said the United States was satisfied with the Japanese Government's statement that it would take the ''necessary steps to contain the effects'' of the Yamaichi collapse. **********American officials also reported progress on another of the economic issues facing them in the region, negotiating the terms under which China would join the World Trade Organization, the body that sets the rules for international commerce. **********Administration officials said China had made a ''significant'' new offer to the United States Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, in the last several days, and that Presidents Clinton and Jiang had directed their trade ministries to follow up with further talks.

I had just won early retirement. New York State had offered the opportunity as part of its downsizing and privatizing plans for government services, and I had applied. But because of an odd set of circumstances, I learned only three hours before the end of the eligibility period that my application had been accepted. This meant that the notification of my retirement coincided with my last official day of work. **********As my thoughts raced between the regretful ''I love it here'' to the determined ''No, it's time to move on -- there's nothing to be gained by being present at the end,'' my secretary walked in. She had a sad look on her face and boxes in her hands -- ''for whatever you want to take home,'' she said, adding as she left, ''I'll start going through the files.'' **********Files. My life's work. I shuddered, then dug into the drawers in my office. I was startled to find so much paper. ''Look how much I don't need,'' I said. ''Into the trash with you.'' Why had I kept all of this? **********I have always loved my work, but over the years as a government employee, I had grown tired of defending government's right to provide high-quality services. Excellence is hardly relevant when the state is holding the ax of privatization over everyone's head. **********I was leaving, but I would not be out of work. I had a fine job offer in hand. Thoughts of the journey ahead energized me through the sad handshakes and hugs that interrupted my packing. **********After one break, though, I returned to my office to discover that one of my boxes -- with 20 pounds of papers, tapes and souvenirs, was missing. My secretary shrugged: ''I warned you not to put anything you wanted to save on the floor,'' she said. To the housekeeper, it seemed, that spelled junk. **********Frantically, I called housekeeping  and learned that the cleaning person in question had already left for the day. Then came the really bad news: the contents of the box had probably landed outside, in one of the center's three huge trash bins. **********I rushed out to see if I could find my papers before they were hauled away. It was a hot and sticky day, and I was perspiring from anxiety and exertion in my race against an unknown garbage truck. **********The metal bins had walls about 5 feet high, 10 feet long and 6 feet wide. The first bin was stinky with overripe fruit and other food remains. No papers there, thank goodness. The second contained only long metal bars and scraps of sheet metal. **********With great trepidation, I peered into the last, which was half full. Yes! There, on top of other office discards, were my papers. Behind the bin was the box. **********But how could I rescue my belongings? I could seek help from the maintenance department -- after all, I was still the deputy director, if only for another hour. But what if the garbage truck arrived during the few minutes I was away? **********I soon decided that it wasn't right to ask anyone for help. Had I been so ruined by bureaucracy and position that I could no longer perform basic life chores for myself? **********Resolutely, I threw in the box and grabbed the side of the warm green bin with both hands. After looking both ways to be sure no one was coming, I tossed one leg over the side of the bin and then pulled myself in. And there I was, standing on top of a mound of waste that made me 9 feet tall. **********After a few moments of playing out several fantasies, including jumping up and down and waving to people at a distance, I got to work. I refilled the box, carried it to the edge of the bin and let it plop to the ground. With a quick au revoir, I climbed out. My heart raced; sweat ran down my face. Another wave of embarrassment swept over me. Then, surprise! Out of me pushed a deep, extended laugh, laden with tension: Here I was, not quite retired and already treated like a human version of a superannuated wreck --  discarded, most ingloriously, on the trash heap. No longer of value to the administrative machine, I joined the rest of its useless material. **********BUT I soon replaced that metaphor with a more satisfactory, and accurate, explanation. After all, such longtime employment shouldn't end on a sour note.  And my need for a meaningful, positive existence kept me from translating this accident into something  without redemptive qualities. **********As I walked away from the bin to share this tale with friends, I understood that what had happened to me was part of the prolonged blessing that had been my whole work experience. That day, I intentionally dove into the garbage to rescue work I cherished. How many individuals from life's various pathways feel their work deserves such preservation? And that is the essence of my profit from years of hard work.

Powell, also comes as Congressional Republicans have been denouncing the I.R.S. for its administration of the tax laws.

Last year one in four workers, or more than 28 million Americans, had been in their current jobs for less than a year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated. **********The Internal Revenue Service attorney who represented the Government, J. Paul Knap, said yesterday that he agreed with Judge Powell that the law was unfair, but that the I.R.S. had no choice but to enforce it. **********The case was brought by Colleen Henry, 37, a reporter for WISN Channel 12 in Milwaukee, who put $2,000 into an I.R.A. in 1993 and took a deduction that reduced her Federal income tax by $560.

But sometimes the law is wrong, and I hope you are an enlightened judge, and even if you decide I have to pay the tax I hope you will make a statement that this law is dumb and send a message to Congress.'' **********In an opinion issued Tuesday, Judge Powell said he had no power to rule that her participation in the Chattanooga 401(k) plan was de minimis, or insignificant, or to consider the fact that she was not eligible to participate in her new employer's 401(k) plan during 1993. **********''While the result may seem harsh,'' Judge Powell wrote, ''we cannot ignore the plain language of the statute and, in effect, rewrite the statute to achieve what may be a more equitable result.'' **********Mr. Knap, the I.R.S. attorney, said he had no choice but to argue that Ms. Henry's tax deduction should be denied. **********''She has a great argument with Congress that this isn't terribly fair,'' Mr. Knap said. **********A worker who changes jobs once a year between ages 18 and 25 would lose a tax deduction worth $560 annually at the 28 percent income tax rate on income above $35,000.

It was often denounced by the authorities as being a tool of Serbia's enemies. **********To register his disapproval of the siege of Sarajevo by the Bosnian Serbs, Mr. Zivotic visited the city in 1993, slipping through Bosnian Serb lines. **********He was also an outspoken critic of Serbia's treatment of non-Serbs within its borders, especially the some two million Albanians in the Kosovo region. And when nationalists began to threaten Muslims in the Sanjak region of Serbia early in the Bosnia war he went to live with Muslim families. **********''This is not just the death of an individual, but the death of an intellectual tradition,'' said Obrad Savic, the editor of the Belgrade Circle journal. ''He was rejected all his life. He lived on the margins. But he never gave up his engagement in the world. He believed passionately in the common humanity of all people and endured great hardship and loneliness in his battle for human decency.'' **********Despite his stature he was ignored by the Serbian press, even the opposition press, and was never invited to speak at the anti-Government protests that gripped Belgrade for the last three months. **********The decision by student and opposition leaders to keep him away came because of his firm belief that Serbian society could only renew itself by accepting the blame for the Balkan wars and ridding itself of Serbian nationalist invective that he denounced as racist. **********''The first act any new president of this country must do is travel to Sarajevo and beg for forgiveness, just as Willy Brandt did when he traveled to Warsaw,'' he said in an interview shortly before his death, referring to the West German Chancellor who pursued a policy of reconciliation with the enemies of German Nazism. ''This is the only way we can begin to heal ourselves.'' **********Such language still angers many Serbs who insist that they are the victims in the war and attack the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, not for starting the war but for withdrawing Belgrade's support for the Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia. **********Mr. Zivotic first came to prominence in 1968, when Yugoslav university students staged anti-Communist protests at the time of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. For their support of the students he and seven other philosophy professors were dismissed. He started the Free Belgrade University, which met secretly in houses and whose classes were often broken up by the police. **********Mr. Zivotic did not return to his University of Belgrade post until 1987, seven years after the death of Tito. **********Soon after he regained his old position, he found himself ostracized again because of his condemnation of growing Serbian nationalism. As the wave of nationalism swept through the educational system he was denounced by students and professors as a traitor to the Serbian cause, and he retired in 1994. **********Although a searing critic of his own society, Mr. Zivotic was reluctant to criticize Serbia's opponents. After a lengthy critique of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which he condemned as ''the cradle of Serb nationalism and an enemy of modernity,'' he was asked to assess the role of the Roman Catholic Church, the dominant religion in Croatia, in the conflict between Serbia and Croatia. **********''My role is to examine and criticize myself and my society,'' he said.  ''It is up to the Croatians to examine themselves. I am not competent to be their critic. Ask them.'' **********He is survived by a son, Aleksandar, and a daughter, Dragana Jovicevic, as well as his former wife, Milica, and two grandchildren."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/29/business/four-stations-to-cox-radio.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-05-29", "snippet": "Cox Radio Inc will buy four radio stations serving Birmingham, Ala, market: WENN-FM and WAGG-AM from Booker T Washington Broadcasting Service Inc and WBHJ-AM and WBHK-FM from H & P Radio LLC; terms undisclosed (S)", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Four Stations to Cox Radio", "print_headline": "Four Stations to Cox Radio", "body_text": " **********Cox Radio Inc. said today that it would buy four radio stations serving the Birmingham, Ala., market: WENN-FM and WAGG-AM from Booker T.

Their overwhelmingly Roman Catholic party took seats away from both the mainstream Catholic-dominated Social Democratic Labor party and the hard-line Protestant Democratic Unionist Party. **********Before the election, Sinn Fein held no seats in the Westminster Parliament and had never won two seats in the House of Commons. **********Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness, who has been Sinn Fein's chief negotiator with British officials in the peace effort, will not occupy the seats, however, because Sinn Fein policy precludes them from taking the required loyalty oath to the British Crown, which the party considers an illegal occupier. But they said the party would open offices in London near the House of Commons and argue their positions from outside. **********The effects the results might have on efforts to end the sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland were unclear. But experts said Sinn Fein was now in a stronger political position and better able to insist that it has a moral and political mandate. **********The largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party, was also strengthened, while the hard-line Protestant party of the Rev. Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist Party, was weakened. **********Of the 18 seats from Northern Ireland, the mainstream Ulster Unionist Party, the largest political organization in the province, gained 1 seat and now holds 10; Mr. Paisley's party lost a seat and has 2; a smaller unionist party has 1, and the Social Democratic Labor Party, after losing a seat to Mr. Adams, has 3. **********The Social Democrats received 60 percent of the Catholic vote and Sinn Fein received 40 percent. Sinn Fein's total vote in this Protestant-dominated British province was 16.1 percent, the highest province-wide total ever. **********The question now is whether the new configuration will move the stengthened mainstream unionists toward accepting Sinn Fein at the negotiating table, and whether Sinn Fein's show of strength will produce an I.R.A. cease-fire. **********Mr. Adams made it immediately clear that he would use his party's showing to argue that Sinn Fein should be invited to join the formal peace talks when they resume in Belfast on June 3 under the chairmanship of George J. Mitchell, a former United States Senate majority leader. **********The Irish and British Goverments have said that Sinn Fein should be excluded from the talks until the I.R.A. restores the 17-month cease-fire it broke in February 1996. Sinn Fein advocates a peaceful settlement of the conflict, but steadfastly refuses to condemn the I.R.A.'s campaign of violence. **********Today, Mr. Adams said, ''I want to see an end to all armed actions,'' but he said nothing about trying to persuade the I.R.A. to restore the cease-fire. His message for the Dublin and London Governments, he said, was that his party's victory meant it deserved ''equality'' and ''inclusive negotiations.'' **********The new British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said little during his campaing about what his Northern Ireland policy would be. But in an article in The Irish Times in Dublin on Monday, he wrote: ''Perhaps Sinn Fein's ambivalence about violence reflects its small electoral base. But democracy requires that even the smallest party pursue its aims through methods that are exclusively peaceful. It is a lesson that Sinn Fein must learn before it will earn the right to sit and talk with other democratic parties in Northern Ireland.'' **********John Hume, the leader of the Social Democrats, who was re-elected from the western part of the province, said he hoped that the Labor Government would invite Sinn Fein when the peace talks resume. This implied, as Mr. Hume has repeatedly stated, that there would first be an I.R.A. cease-fire. ''Let's keep spilling our sweat and not our blood,'' he added. **********While Mr. Hume and Mr. Adams are enemies in elections, they were together in initiating the current peace effort in 1993 and have said that, with the elections over, they will again cooperate to move the stalled peace effort forward. **********Most experts say that, in effect, Mr. Hume's cooperation with Mr. Adams in the peace effort helped elect Mr. Adams over Mr. Hume's Social Democratic colleague, Dr. Joe Hendron. Mr. Adams had won the seat twice, in 1983 and 1987, before Dr. Hendron defeated him in 1992 by 589 votes.

In the morning, his neat rows of cornstalks were interrupted by huge empty areas. **********Mr. Mandizwidza is far too scared of elephants, which kill at least one person a year in this district 100 miles north of Harare, to stay up all night banging a pot to drive them away. On the other hand, he wasn't all that upset either. Lately, the district has been making money from the elephants here in the flat Zambezi Valley where baobab trees with thick trunks offer the little shade to be found. **********Most of the money, which flows from tourism and a handful of very expensive hunting licenses, has been used to build Muzarabani a clinic, a cattle feedlot and a treasured beer hall. **********Mr. Mandizwidza wants a fence, but to keep the elephants in, not out. **********''I would want this fence there tomorrow, even today,'' he said, pointing to a line beyond his fields where another district begins. ''The elephants give some benefits to us.'' **********Now there is the possibility of even more elephant money to tempt villagers to regard the animals as something more than really big, cranky pests. **********Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia have huge stockpiles of tusks from elephants that died naturally, were culled to limit populations or were killed for threatening people. The three nations are joining forces this year to fight the international ban on the sale of ivory. If they prevail when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites, meets in Zimbabwe in June, it will be the first time since 1989 that a legal sale of African ivory will be allowed. **********A bruising battle is expected. Southern African countries proposed renewing ivory sales at the 1992 and 1994 meetings, but backed down after animal rights groups and other African countries said that would lead to a new round of poaching. **********This time, though, a new proposal may have a chance. The three countries want to sell one large batch of ivory a year to Japan, which has promised not to export any of it. Despite an international campaign by animal groups to discourage an affinity for tusks -- one that was very effective in Europe and the United States -- Japan has never lost its appetite for ivory purse ties and other carved knicknacks. **********In the basement of the National Parks headquarters in Harare, lined up on rough wooden shelves under 24-hour guard, Zimbabwe has 40 tons of tusks, each stamped with an identification number. Botswana has 30 tons. Namibia has about 8 tons. **********With offers as high as $250 a pound coming in, such stockpiles could mean millions to countries where subsistence farming is the norm and running water and electricity are rare. **********Botswana officials say their commitment to conserving wildlife has been proved: 37 percent of the nation's land is in parks or conservancies. But they argue that such an investment must be rewarded. **********''We need to have something to give back to the communities who bear the brunt of this,'' said Joseph Matlhare, deputy director of the Department of Wildlife and National Parks. ''If there are benefits that can accrue other than tourism, we want to look at that. There are plenty of communities where people are getting killed when they go to fetch water.'' **********Elephants may be threatened elsewhere on this continent, but not in most of southern Africa. Poaching is negligible in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia, which all have growing populations of elephants -- more than 150,000 among them, experts estimate. That's too many, some think. Some forests have been stripped down to stumps. **********What the countries do not have is cash -- cash that could be used to build fences, monitor elephants and compensate farmers like Mr. Mandizwidza. Government officials and local conservationists argue that the income would help make local people like the Muzarabani residents more tolerant of the huge herbivores, which can eat for up to 18 hours a day and will happily knock down a farmer's granary hut to get at the food inside. **********The three are tired of paying the price for other countries, like Angola, where war decimated the herds, and Kenya, where incompetence and corruption let poachers flourish. Moving adult elephants is dangerous and expensive, so herds cannot simply be shipped north. **********''There is every indication that there is a much greater understanding of the problems in southern Africa this year,'' said Jonathan Barzdo, who monitors the issue for Cites. ''And they have a much better proposal with strict controls in place.'' **********But some conservation groups, especially American and European ones, say the proposal will open the floodgates, encouraging the kind of poaching that saw the continent's elephant population fall from 1.3 million in 1979 to an estimated 500,000 today. **********''It's the first deadly step toward full-fledged resumption of the ivory trade,'' said Wayne Pacelle, vice president of the Humane Society of the United States, which intends to lobby against the proposal. **********The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which has 136 member countries, has no sanctions to impose on members that ignore its rules. But experts say poor countries are often bound in indirect ways. Tourism and foreign aid could dry up if they do not toe the line. **********Experts with the Convention on International Trade and Endangered Species like some aspects of the proposal. One-time sales would be easy to inspect and control, they said. But they find flaws too. Zimbabwe has not stemmed ivory smuggling at its borders and Botswana has not promised to use the ivory revenues for conservation or for villages in elephant areas. **********Certainly the income has gone a long way to changing attitudes in Muzarabani, where the elephant was previously best appreciated as barbecue meat. Nowadays farmers like Mr. Mandizwidza are even pressured to keep quiet about crop damage so Government sharpshooters won't kill the elephants as nuisances before fee-paying foreign hunters can be flown in. **********''People are beginning to understand that there is a need to preserve the elephant, not just for the income but because it is our inheritance,'' said the district's chief executive, Luckson Chisanduro. ''But the income doesn't hurt.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/28/world/former-enemies-speak-of-peace.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 881, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Former Enemies Speak of Peace", "print_headline": "Former Enemies Speak of Peace", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from remarks by President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia as they signed an agreement between Russia and NATO. Mr. Yeltsin's remarks were translated by a Russian Government translator. **********President Clinton **********Ladies and gentlemen, on this beautiful spring day in Paris, in the twilight of the 20th century, we look toward a new century with a new Russia and a new NATO, working together in a new Europe of unlimited possibility. The NATO-Russia Founding Act we have just signed joins a great nation and history's most successful alliance in common cause for a long-sought but never before realized goal -- a peaceful, democratic, undivided Europe. **********The United States feels a great deal of gratitude today. The world my predecessors dreamed of and worked for for 50 years is finally within reach. . . . **********From now on, NATO and Russia will consult and coordinate and work together. Where we all agree, we will act jointly, as we are in Bosnia where a Russian brigade serves side by side with NATO troops, giving the Bosnian people a chance to build a lasting peace. Deepening our partnership today will make all of stronger and more secure. **********The historic change in the relationship between NATO and Russia grows out of a fundamental change in how we think about each other and our future. NATO's member states recognize that the Russian people are building a new Russia, defining their greatness in terms of the future as much as the past. Russia's transition to democracy and open markets is as difficult as it is dramatic. And its steadfast commitment to freedom and reform has earned the world's admiration. **********In turn, we are building a new NATO. It will remain the strongest alliance in history, with smaller, more flexible forces, prepared to provide for our defense, but also trained for peacekeeping. It will work closely with other nations that share our hopes and values and interests through the Partnership For Peace. **********It will be an alliance directed no longer against a hostile bloc of nations, but instead designed to advance the security of every democracy in Europe -- NATO's old members, new members, and non-members alike. **********I know that some still see NATO through the prism of the cold war, and that especially in NATO's decision to open its doors to Central Europe's new democracy, they see a Europe still divided, only differently divided. But I ask them to look again. For this new NATO will work with Russia, not against it. And by reducing rivalry and fear, by strengthening peace and cooperation, by facing common threats to the security of all democracies, NATO will promote greater stability in all of Europe, including Russia. And in turn, that will increase the security of Europe's North American partners, the United States and Canada, as well. **********We establish this partnership because we are determined to create a future in which European security is not a zero-sum game -- where NATO's gain is Russia's loss, and Russia's strength is our alliance's weakness. That is old thinking; these are new times. Together, we must build a new Europe in which every nation is free and every free nation joins in strengthening the peace and stability for all. **********President Yeltsin **********I'll be absolutely frank and candid with you and tell you that for the Russian leadership the decision to prepare a document with NATO was far from easy. **********We had to make sure we protected the security of our country; but at the same time we also had to, of course, create the basis, the foundation for a constructive cooperation between Russia and NATO. **********Russia still views negatively the expansion plans of NATO. At the same time, however, we recognize, we pay tribute to the readiness exhibited by NATO countries, despite those difficulties, to reach an agreement with Russia and take into account our interests. **********And that is precisely the rationale of the situation we're experiencing now, the difficulty of negotiations between Russia and NATO and also the essence, the thrust, of the Founding Act itself. **********Through joint efforts in that document we try to answer very difficult questions. **********And those very difficult issues deal, first of all, with nondeployment of nuclear weapons. **********There is an obligation to nondeploy on a permanent basis NATO's combat forces near Russia. All of this means that we have agreed not to harm the security interests of each other. And I think it is the most important accomplishment for us all. **********What is also very important is that we are creating the mechanisms for consultation and cooperation between Russia and the alliance. And this will enable us to -- on a fair, egalitarian basis -- to discuss, and when need be, pass joint decisions on major issues relating to security and stability, those issues and those areas which touch upon our interests. **********The fate of this continent, Europe, has not been  easy. It is very easy to list the wars and skirmishes it has undergone. Each century has brought with it new tests and new challenges, new wars to the soil of this continent. **********Several times attempts to stem this tragic chain of events have been made, but now our efforts can and should bear fruit. It has been almost 10 years, and for the first time in history, the people of Europe are joined together by common democratic values."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/25/your-money/IHT-for-investment-clubs-discipline-pays.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Wall", "pub_date": "1997-01-25", "snippet": "WHETHER you are a stock-market novice or a seasoned investor, forming an investment club a sort ofdo-it-yourself mutual fund \u2014can be a useful way to learn more about stock selection while having fun andseeing your investments grow.Or so goes", "word_count": 5245, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Your Money", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Investment Clubs, Discipline Pays", "print_headline": "For Investment Clubs, Discipline Pays", "body_text": " **********WHETHER you are a stock-market novice or a seasoned investor, forming an investment club a sort ofdo-it-yourself mutual fund \u2014can be a useful way to learn more about stock selection while having fun andseeing your investments grow.Or so goes the theory. **********Club members contribute agreed-upon sums, often monthly, and meet to decide what investments to buy and sell. Most of the organizations have elements of social clubs, which can make them fun to belong to although at the risk of limiting profitability. **********TheMoney Report has profiled several of these clubs, and this week we check in with three of them. What we found was that when a club identifies and maintains a sensible strategy, it prospers \u2014 but those that are more relaxed stand to lose money. **********The Victoria Investment Club of Cornwall,in England,iscelebrating a rare coup. Its 17 members recently took part in an investment challenge sponsored by ProShare (UK), an independent body that represents British investment clubs. The Victoria club beat investors at NatWest Stockbrokers, winning a prize of \u00a35,000 ($8,100) **********What makes this achievement all the more remarkable is thatuntil recently the club's investments have not been very successful. When the club was mentioned in a Money Report article in October 1995, it was running at a loss. Derek Richards, the chairman, acknowledgedthat there was too much chitchatand not enough serious work being done. **********Mr. Richards saidinvestment performance started to pick up when the members decided to treat the venture like a business instead of just a social club. \"The members agreed on a definitive investment strategy and stuck with it irrespective of market movements. Rather than invest piecemeal in a mixture of blue-chip, medium-sized and small companies, we decided to concentrate solely on small companies and limit our investment in each stock to \u00a31,500,\" he said. **********\"The club also decided to get rid of stocks that were showing a loss. In the past we held onto loss-making companies in the hope that their performance would eventually improve.\" **********The club currently holds eight stocks. In 1996, the club made an overall gain of around 30 percent. Members arelooking at several new investment possibilities for 1997, including Flying Flowers Ltd., a British mail-order company listed on the London exchange, andT.V. Corp., a television production services company. **********The Sirens, an all-women investment club from Oxford, in England, was featured in The Money Report early last year because it had been awarded the ProShare prize for the most promising new investment club of 1995. **********The club maintains an ethical investing philosophy. It will not, for example, invest in any company linked to tobacco production, defense and the exploitation of animals or Third World resources. **********In recent months, the club has not been doing very well.Profits are down and club morale has suffered as a result.Beverly Chisnall, the chairman, said the club was a victim of its own success. \"We got carried away with our initial good fortuneand started cutting corners. Reseach was not as thorough as it could have been and several poor investment decisions were made,\" she said. **********The club decided to get rid of most of its recent holdings and more or less start from scratch. Rather than invest hundreds of pounds in individual stocks, members agreed to save up and invest larger amounts, up to \u00a33,000 in some cases. **********The Sirens' top holding is in National Express Group PLC, a British bus company. It is also looking to invest a significant sum in Oxford Instruments PLC, a medical-equipment manufacturer. \"We try to invest in local companies as much as possible. Some of our members know this Oxford Instruments very well and are confident in the management team. The balance sheets are also encouraging,\" Ms. Chisnall said. **********Few investment clubs that have been going for more than five years can claim to have had a trouble-free run. The Taffy Investment Club of Kansas is a rare exception. The club, which comprises four generations of the Taylor and Andrews families, boasts an average annual return of 25 percent.Even more remarkable, the club has never had an unprofitable year in its decade-long history. **********Robert Taylor, who, at 76, is one of the oldest club members, describes the club's investment strategy as \"conservative\" and \"long-term.\" He said: \"We buy established companies with good growth prospects and hang onto them through thick and thin.\" The club's first purchase, Home Depot Inc., is still in theportfolio. **********Mr. Taylor admitted to being \"pretty nervous\" about the current state of the U.S. stock market.The club has decided to look at defensive stocks in the next few months to guard against a likely downturn.

Now an agency association is asking them to consider doing that literally. **********The Institute of Canadian Advertising, a trade organization based in Toronto, is undertaking an unusual initiative to convince American marketers to consider shops north of the 49th parallel when they award accounts. The effort being sponsored by the institute, which is the Canadian equivalent of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, carries the theme -- what else? -- ''Push the boundaries.'' **********''Canadians are not well known for standing up and saying, 'Look at me,' '' said John A. Harding, executive vice president of the institute. ''But we have a story to tell.'' **********''An advertiser in New York doesn't think twice about using an agency from Minneapolis or Portland,'' he added. ''It's just as conceivable to look at an agency north of the border.'' (Or in the case of Detroit area advertisers, south of the border.) **********The ambitious initiative includes print advertisements, direct and interactive marketing and a public relations campaign, all meant to generate requests for a videotape and booklet about the abilities of Canadian agencies. The effort is indicative of the growing globalization of advertising as multinational marketers increasingly look at results rather than passports. **********''Where ideas come from is not as important as whether or not they work,'' said Andy Krupski, chairman of the institute's business development committee, who is president and chief executive at the Grey Canada unit of Grey Advertising in Toronto. ''This is the first step in a continuing program to make sure the world is aware of the talent that's in Canada.'' **********The initiative offers a lengthy list of what the institute describes as the advantages of hiring Canadian agencies, from favorable exchange rates to efficient production facilities to experience in ethnic marketing. **********''Our industry has to work in two official languages by law,'' Mr. Krupski said, referring to English and French, ''and in three or four by a market perspective. Because we have a lot of constituencies, we have to make ideas strong enough to work across cultural lines.'' **********''And typically we do that with fewer dollars than may be afforded in the U.S.,'' he added, ''which may make us more agile and frugal.'' **********But persuading Americans that other countries can be capable of effective work is a challenge not unlike withstanding a Canadian winter without a warm coat. **********''U.S. chauvinism'' is daunting, said Stan Sutter, editor of Marketing Magazine, a weekly trade publication in Toronto, who described the initiative as ''calling the bluff of all the companies that say they believe in globalization.'' **********''If globalization is real,'' he asked, ''why not use an agency in Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal?'' **********Another reason the institute is prospecting for American clients, he said, is that ''since the recession of the early 1990's, it's been tough on the agency industry here.'' ''Accounts keep going south,'' he added. **********O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the association of American agencies, echoed that. **********''A lot of companies are handling Canada out of the United States,'' he said, ''which eventually leads to a consolidation of Canadian assignments -- handled by Canadian agencies or Canadian offices of U.S. agencies -- at U.S. agencies.'' **********''I know the people up there quite well,'' he added, referring to the managers of Canadian agencies, ''and they're good, smart ad people. But there are some pretty good agencies here. The ultimate test is whether the work will be as good as they can get here.'' **********At least one advertiser has decided that a Canadian agency ought to handle an American assignment. TDL Group Ltd., a unit of Wendy's International that operates the Tim Hortons chain of Canadian doughnut and coffee shops, is using its Canadian agency, Enterprise Creative Selling, to create campaigns to introduce Hortons in American markets like Detroit and Columbus, Ohio. **********''We believe our agency up here understands our business and the message we need to get across in a new market,'' said Patti Jameson, corporate communications director at TDL Group in Oakville, Ontario. ''There is some merit in saying that opening a store in Buffalo is very similar to opening a store in Mississauga,'' a Toronto suburb. **********But last month, Northern Telecom in Brampton, Ontario, shifted its corporate advertising account from one American agency (J. Walter Thompson San Francisco, part of WPP Group) to another (the Bozell Worldwide unit of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt in New York). **********Indeed, Mr. Krupski said, one goal of the initiative is to remind Canadian advertisers ''not to forget there's some good talent up here, too.'' **********Several agencies in Toronto are contributing to the effort: the Harrod & Mirlin unit of True North Communications and the Saatchi & Saatchi Canada unit of Cordiant P.L.C., which worked on the print ads; Grey Interactive, which designed a World Wide Web site (http://www.ica-ad.com), and Spectrum Public Relations, part of the BBDO Canada unit of Omnicom Group."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/08/world/controversy-diminishes-italy-s-clout-in-albania.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1997-06-08", "snippet": "Recent criticisms of Albania by Italian diplomats heightens tensions in already sensitive relationship betwen both countries; statements have fueled controversy three weeks before Albanian elections, in which outcome could be test of Italy's credi...", "word_count": 735, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Controversy Diminishes Italy's Clout In Albania", "print_headline": "Controversy Diminishes Italy's Clout In Albania", "body_text": " **********Two embarrassing episodes have given Italian diplomacy in Albania a black eye, self-inflicted at a critical moment in the sensitive relationship between the countries that face each other across a narrow stretch of the Adriatic Sea. **********First, Italy had to recall its longtime Ambassador to Albania because of damaging things he reportedly said in a taped conversation, a transcript of which was printed in an Albanian newspaper. Then last weekend, his successor's appointment was withdrawn within 48 hours of its announcement because of comments he reportedly made to an Italian newspaper. **********Only three weeks remain before Albanian elections, considered crucial for restoring stability to a country that was teetering on the edge of anarchy in March, after people revolted over the collapse of several get-rich-quick investment schemes. And with each day come reports of fresh violence, casting a long shadow over an already shaky democratic process. **********The latest report, on Albania's state-controlled television on Wednesday, was of a hand grenade thrown at a rally for President Sali Berisha outside the capital, Tirana. That report came two days after 20 people were wounded by a bomb blast at a Tirana cafe owned and frequented by ranking members of the opposition Socialist Party. **********The violence is a major concern for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which under the leadership of a former Austrian Chancellor, Franz Vranitsky, has undertaken to monitor the June 29 elections and try to keep them free of the fraud that clouded Mr. Berisha's victory in voting in May 1996. **********But Italy also has a lot at stake in the Albanian voting, including its credibility as an international crisis manager. **********In the early days of the crisis, Italy -- faced with an influx of 16,000 Albanian refugees -- took a lead role in trying to drum up a common European policy. It failed to get full support from its northern partners but was given the command of a 6,500-troop multinational force deployed in Albania two months ago under a limited United Nations mandate. **********For that reason, and because of the legacy of the occupation of Albania by Italy's Fascist Government before World War II, the Albanian mission has been viewed here and abroad as a test of Italy's military and diplomatic leadership. And while the Italian military performance in Albania generally gets good marks, the embarrassments over the ambassadors is seen as evidence of Italy's difficulties in coping with its new responsibilities. **********''The real problem is that this is the first time we are taking the lead in an international crisis and because of our long tradition of following in the wake of others, we have discovered that we lack a proper decision-making structure,'' said Franco Venturini, a noted commentator on foreign affairs for the newspaper Corriere della Sera. ''The result is that we have not had a solid agreement on policy right from the beginning.'' **********What made the fiasco of the ambassadors so embarrassing was that their reported comments -- denied in both cases -- reflected the real splits that have beset Italy's Albanian policy, principally relations with Mr. Berisha. **********The outgoing Ambassador, Paolo Foresti, was quoted by the Albanian opposition newspaper Independent as urging a top Berisha ally to undercut a pre-election accord negotiated by Mr. Vranitsky. **********His successor, Manfredo Incisa di Camerana, was quoted by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica as saying Mr. Foresti himself had a history of political involvement. **********Ever since Albania emerged in 1990 from the isolation imposed by its longtime Communist rulers, Italy has taken a close interest in its neighbor. Italian businesses moved into Albania, and Italian political leaders soon took up positions on Albanian politics, with right-wing leaders favoring Mr. Berisha's Democratic Party and leftists showing more sympathy for the Socialist opposition. **********The recent appointment of Gen. Franco Angioni, a respected former commander of Italian troops in Lebanon, to head an intergovernment task force on Albania based in Rome is widely seen as a way of straightening out the mixed signals coming from Rome in recent weeks. **********But according to foreign and Italian analysts, it is also a recognition that Italian involvement with Albania is not likely to end soon after the June election. **********''The problem of Albania is potentially everyone's, but most immediately, it is Italy's problem,'' a foreign diplomat said. ''And the appointment of General Angioni is a sign that the Italians are coming to grips with the fact that the burden is going to be theirs for a long time.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/01/business/key-rates-861006.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-03-01", "snippet": "Table shows key interest rates", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/18/world/the-great-gold-rush-in-zaire.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1997-04-18", "snippet": "Howard W French analysis contends that even before Laurent Kabila, leader of Zaire's rebellion, can finish off dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko, series of major business deals may enable him to resist Western pressures for economic change and demo...", "word_count": 1195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Great Gold Rush in Zaire", "print_headline": "The Great Gold Rush in Zaire", "body_text": " **********Even before the leader of Zaire's rebellion can finish off the dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko and seize this country's capital, a series of major business deals may enable him to resist Western pressures for economic change and democracy. **********The most spectacular of these deals, an $885 million contract between the rebellion and an American mining company, American Mineral Fields, announced Wednesday in the rebel-held city of Lubumbashi, would rehabilitate zinc, copper and cobalt mines in the country's southern Shaba Province. **********Now, Zairian economic experts, former Government officials and diplomats here say that business like this has dramatically increased the leeway for the leader of the rebellion, Laurent Kabila, to decide whose aid and advice to accept, even when he has not won power outright. **********In recent weeks, as Mr. Kabila has drawn closer to his goal of unseating Mr. Mobutu, many Western Governments have taken the view that the impending change here is bound to bring improvement to Africa's worst-governed country. **********Far from a statement of faith in Mr. Kabila, a lifelong revolutionary with a checkered past, this optimism is based in large part on the notion of leverage. Although Zaire is richly endowed with natural resources, its economy is near collapse, and many assume that rebuilding the country will require huge amounts of foreign assistance. **********Mr. Mobutu has been cut off from foreign aid and lending during this decade, and there has been an assumption throughout this war that Mr. Kabila, or whoever succeeds the longtime President, would be eager to ingratiate himself with Western governments in order to have access to development loans and other assistance. **********''You are not going to see any kind of American aid program here before we have elections,'' said a senior Western diplomat. ''We will not support dictator Kabila.'' **********But starting late last year, almost imperceptibly at first, and quickly gathering steam, there has been a rush of mining companies and other economic operators out of Kinshasa, where corruption has always made business difficult, into rebel-held areas rich in minerlas, where Mr. Kabila's associates have been quick to offer advantageous terms to adventurous investors. **********The first of Mr. Kabila's major deals involved the huge Kilo-Moto gold field in northeastern Zaire, which is commonly referred to here as Mr. Mobutu's personal gold mine.  At Kilo-Moto, a senior Zairian mining official here said, a Belgian-South African company that was turned down last year for a $162 million in World Bank financing to rehabilitate the mine is now raising money for the project by buying gold from free-lance miners, which is exported at a handsome profit. **********Officials here said that another company, the Canadian-controlled firm Sominki, which formerly mined tin in Zaire, is now investing in gold production in the region of the rebel-held east-central city of Kindu. **********Where Zaire's official gold mining registry used to show receipts for several major foreign mining firms, today, in a reflection of the loss of most of the country's mineral rich zones to the rebellion, there is only one Western company that still declares its gold production -- about 200 pounds each month -- to Mr. Mobutu's Government. **********Most of the other operators are believed to be already active in rebel-held zones. **********Mining experts say that in recent years Zaire has had fraudulent exports of about 900 pounds of gold each month, and by sanctioning the official corruption that has been a way of life here, the rebels stand to gain an even bigger windfall from this. **********''The east of our country is so rich that is does not need to have huge investments to restart the economy,'' said Willy Katupa, editor of the Zairian economic review Perspectives. ''Just by controlling the borders and diminishing fraud, the rebellion can expect to start receiving large sums of money. The foreign investment will certainly follow.'' **********The story here is much the same for diamonds. Until recently, Kinshasa was averaging about $20 million a month in revenues from small-scale diamond producers, and an additional $8 million a month from the state-owned industrial mining company, Miba. But with the fall of East Kasai Province two weeks ago, all of that wealth, and the cash flow it generates, is controlled by the rebels. **********Many here fear that Mr. Kabila's treatment of Miba's wealth may be indicative of his broader approach to power. Although the charges are unproved, it is widely believed in diplomatic and business circles that when Mr. Kabila swept triumphantly into the diamond-mining capital of Mbuji-Mayi recently, he forced Miba's managers to hand over all the production on hand. **********The director of the company, Jonas Mukamba, a longtime partner of Mr. Mobutu, was reportedly flown off to Goma where he is said to be under house arrest. **********''The March diamond production was already packed up and awaiting transport to Kinshasa,'' said one senior mining official here, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''Kabila just carted it off.'' **********In the 1970's, long after Zaire's other early insurrections had collapsed, Mr. Kabila reportedly thrived with a small band of rebels in the Fizi-Baraka mountains of eastern Zaire by mining gold and paying off soldiers sent to wipe them out. **********''This is a guy who knows a little bit about gold and corruption,'' said one regional military analyst. **********Little, meanwhile, is known about Mr. Kabila's philosophy of government. Based on his movement's statements so far, it can be said that there is no inclination toward Western-style elections presided over by international observers. **********Today, in fact, the strongest outside influences on Mr. Kabila come from Uganda's President, Yoweri Museveni, whom he calls a ''good friend,'' and the Rwandan Vice President and strongman, Paul Kagame. Both leaders took power by force. **********Neither Uganda nor Rwanda bear much resemblance to Western democracies, and Mr. Kabila seems to have followed Mr. Museveni's early political blueprint by saying that he will not tolerate opposition political parties during a transitional phase in power. **********During Mr. Kabila's early years in revolt against Mr. Mobutu, he was known as a committed Marxist. The beliefs that he seems to have carried through the years come from Patrice Lumumba, a hero of African nationalism who was Zaire's first prime minister.

''Our economies cannot develop, or be responsive to the needs of our peoples, solely on a monetary or anti-inflationary basis,'' Mr. Jospin said today. **********The French Finance Minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said: ''We want to fight public deficits, and we also want to fight unemployment.

The revision was planned to smooth preparations for the common currency and to prepare the way for admission of new members from Central Europe to the European Union after the currency goes into effect. **********Neither French nor German leaders made public any details of exactly what the new French Government was asking for, but they said that discussions would continue over the weekend and in Amsterdam. **********But according to aides to Mr. Chirac, whose ousted conservative Government cut spending in the last two years, Mr. Kohl made clear that the strapped Germans could not agree to any measures that would cost more money or add to the European bureaucracy in Brussels. **********German officials said they could agree to work together to improve coordination of the economies of the 15 European Union countries, whose welfare states are now supporting 18 million unemployed people. **********Both Mr. Kohl and Mr. Chirac say part of the reason for the high unemployment is that the high payroll charges and income taxes required to support the welfare state discourage companies from hiring people and make welfare more attractive than earning a living. **********Large Government deficits also perpetuate heavy taxation. Mr. Jospin and his people here appeared to be heading toward an acceptance of the need to hew to the monetary agreement's strict limits on budget deficits, but want a promise of political flexibility in their application. **********Neither France nor Germany is likely to meet the treaty requirement of a deficit of 3 percent of gross domestic product or less by the end of this year, according to a forecast this week by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.

The dollar was also higher against the Japanese yen, rising to 116.58 yen from 116.22 yen **********Late today, there was the first sign of hope that one battle might soon end. Germany's Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, signaled that the Government might be willing to back down on its hotly contested plan to reduce its budget deficit this year with a bookkeeping maneuver to revalue the central bank's gold reserves. The plan would inject some of the gain into the Government treasury and bring Germany's deficit closer to the strict criteria called for in the plan for a single currency. **********Last week, when the central bank objected to the timing of the plan, the German Government said it would go ahead anyway. The Bundesbank wants to revalue its gold hoard but not before May 1998 when the European Union will have decided which countries will initially participate in the single currency. Doing it sooner, the bank declared, threatens its independence and weakens the new currency. **********But late today Mr. Waigel said, ''We will discuss this with the Bundesbank,'' adding, ''We will try to do this in mutual agreement.'' He did not make clear what he had in mind but if he delayed the plan by a year, as the central bank prefers, Germany's budget deficit would exceed the criteria set out for the creation of the euro and would probably undermine its strength. **********Regardless, most analysts say the credibility of the euro has taken a serious blow. **********''What we have to conclude is that European Monetary Union will get off the ground, but as a much weaker currency,'' said J. Paul Horne, an economist for Smith Barney in Paris. ''The two principal actors seem to be saying, 'Let's get to the altar in the easiest way.' '' **********In theory, a weaker euro would hurt the United States by making American-made goods more expensive. Conversely, a strong dollar and a weak euro would make European-made goods less costly. **********European stock markets reacted calmly to the Socialist victory over the conservative coalition of President Jacques Chirac of France. On the Paris Bourse, blue-chip stocks in the CAC-40 index initially plunged by nearly 3 percent but then regained their value and ended the day slightly above Friday's close. The German market closed up 1.63 percent; the London stock exchange ended down 1.27 percent. **********The results puzzled some market analysts, particularly because the Socialist victory in France should in theory spell bad news for French business. But analysts said the stock market's sanguine reaction was partly because investors had furiously sold off French stocks through much of last week, after the first round of elections on May 25 signaled that Mr. Chirac's Government was in deep trouble. **********Beyond that, they said, the movements in both markets reflected a general notion of less strict economies. More relaxed economic policies could easily add some zip to the depressing level of economic activity in both countries, but they could also lead to a much weaker and less credible euro, which is scheduled to make its debut in 1999. **********The French Socialist leader who was named Prime Minister today, Lionel Jospin, has adamantly insisted that countries should not be forced to meet the strict numerical targets for deficits, debt levels and inflation that now determine who will and will not be a part of the new euro.  In a deep break with German views, moreover, he has called for opening the euro to countries like Italy that fall well short of the monetary union's strict criteria. **********The French shift and Germany's new attempts to fudge its own deficit problems through bookkeeping maneuvers have both increased the chances that the new monetary union will have a wider but weaker membership. **********''We have been predicting for some time that the European Monetary Union would be relatively wide, and both these events push things in the same direction,'' said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, global economist for Salomon Brothers in London. ''It should not be surprising if the euro begins somewhat weaker'' than politicians have hoped, he added. **********Sylvain Hefes, managing director for Goldman, Sachs & Company in Paris, said France's leftist Government would bring less change than expected because the Government had very little money to work with. **********''The Socialists asked for a complete audit of public finances today, and what they are going to find is that they have almost no maneuvering room,'' Mr. Hefes said. ''They will not be in a position to do a lot of things.'' **********That now leaves Europe's political leaders, particularly in Germany, with a painful decision. Should they plunge ahead with the euro, even if it would be significantly weaker than the vaunted German mark or even the French franc? Or should they delay the start of the euro until countries have their economies in better order? **********Most financial and political experts believe that European leaders have staked so much of their political careers on the euro that they have long since passed the point of no return. The rise in the dollar, they said, signals a belief that the euro will be started but will be weaker.

Chief Defends Accounting Board", "body_text": " **********On the eve of a Congressional hearing on a proposed accounting rule that has drawn fierce criticism, Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, sharply attacked Congress and the banking industry for intervening in the independent process by which such rules are written. **********He defended the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a panel of accountants established by the commission to come up with a standard way for companies to report to their investors how much they earn, own and owe. **********''Without such rules, the investor would stand unprotected, uninformed and unaware of misleading or deceptive disclosures by those who may seek to distort financial reality,'' Mr. Levitt said in remarks prepared for a speech last night to the Conference Board, a business group. **********''The S.E.C. has traditionally resisted its power to second-guess a F.A.S.B. rule,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''Now Congress, under pressure from some in the business and banking community, is thinking of intervening in this nonpartisan process and second-guessing us both.'' **********The flash point for the fight is a proposed rule that would force companies to tell their shareholders more about the value of transactions they enter into involving derivatives, investments whose value is derived from some underlying asset or index. Currently, companies can often enter into derivatives deals with no impact on their financial statements. **********Banks, which both use and sell derivatives, have criticized the accounting board's proposal for being even more misleading than the current rules. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has echoed these criticisms, as have many lawmakers in Washington. **********Last week, a House subcommittee held a hearing into the issue, and yesterday 23 members of the panel wrote a letter to the F.A.S.B. asking it to delay and reconsider its derivatives rules. **********''Members of the subcommittee expressed real concerns about the particular difficulties raised for the banking industry, bank regulators, and other effects on investors, consumers and users of financial statements,'' the letter said. **********Today, a Senate subcommittee is also scheduled to hold a hearing on the same issue. **********In his prepared remarks, Mr. Levitt specifically took issue with the proposal by John S. Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, to eliminate the F.A.S.B. altogether and have the S.E.C. write accounting rules. **********In a letter to The Wall Street Journal this week, Mr. Reed wrote that ''the basic idea of having a well-funded and competent organization dedicated full time and solely to changing something produces more change than makes any sense.'' **********Mr. Levitt called Mr. Reed's argument ''rich with irony.'' **********''Here, after all, is a bank C.E.O.  urging the Government to immerse itself in the details of technical accounting rules that are important to the bank's business,'' Mr. Levitt said.  ''I wonder if the theory is Government officials would develop better rules because they are much more reasonable, practical, thoughtful and flexible than their rigid, insulated and unresponsive brethren in the private sector.'' **********A spokesman for Mr. Reed said last night that his criticism of the accounting board was that it was ''disdainful of the users.'' **********''It should be independent, but not in an ivory tower manner that doesn't take into account the practical effects of its decisions,'' the spokesman said. **********Mr. Levitt defended the board, noting it has forced companies to disclose otherwise hidden liabilities. For example, in 1992 the F.A.S.B. forced General Motors to admit it was obligated to pay the health care costs of its retired workers, knocking the value of its shareholders' equity from $27 billion to $6 billion, Mr. Levitt said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/05/business/in-a-job-hunt-it-often-is-whom-you-know.html": {"writer_name": "Laura Koss-Feder", "pub_date": "1997-01-05", "snippet": "Stanford and Columbia universities have just released results of two-year study that looked at hiring practices of 80 Western branches of a large bank--the name of which was not disclosed--and found that job applicants who were referred by employe...", "word_count": 733, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In a Job Hunt, It Often Is Whom You Know", "print_headline": "In a Job Hunt, It Often Is Whom You Know", "body_text": " **********CHICKEN soup may or may not cure the common cold. But just in case there are any doubts about another common assumption, ''It's not what you know, but whom you know,'' a new study could dispel them. **********Stanford and Columbia universities have just released the results of a two-year study that looked at the hiring practices of 80 Western branches of a large bank -- the name of which was not disclosed -- and found that job applicants who were referred by employees had a big edge in getting interviews and in being offered jobs. **********During the period of the survey -- January 1993 to March 1995 -- the bank received 5,568 applications to fill 326 entry-level jobs like personal banker, mortgage consultant and teller. Even though only 441, or less than 8 percent, of the applicants were referrals, 351 of them, or 80 percent, were interviewed and they received 115, or 35 percent, of the jobs. **********The study found that the key difference between applicants with referrals and those without was simple: the former had important information about the bank and the skills it wanted; the latter did not. **********Roberto Fernandez, an organizational behavior professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Business who conducted the study with Kathryn Neckerman, a sociology professor at Columbia, said employees who referred applicants had also advised them about what to emphasize in resumes and when to submit those resumes. **********''This shows that having inside information from personal contacts can help guide you through the hiring process,'' Dr. Fernandez said. ''It's like getting married; it's always better to know more information about the person ahead of time.'' **********Eva Wisnik, president of Wisnik Career Strategies, a career consulting firm in New York, said such information could be vital. ''The person with the best information will have the best job opportunities,'' she said. ''Having this information makes someone sound like an insider even if they're not.'' **********Preliminary results from the study also showed that employees who had received referrals ultimately proved to be better suited for their positions. For companies, that can mean less turnover and reduced recruiting costs. For employees, referring friends can sometimes lead to cash bonuses. **********The bank in the study, for example, encourages its employees to make referrals by paying them up to $1,000 if a person they recommend is hired and stays with the bank for at least three months. The Hyatt Hotels Corporation of Chicago pays employees from $100 to $1,000 for successful referrals. **********Noreen Heron, the director of public relations at the Hyatt Regency Chicago, recommended her friend, Mary Rownd, for a marketing job with Hyatt Hotels last year. When Ms. Rownd was hired as manager of hotel marketing in September, Hyatt paid Ms. Heron $250. **********''It's wonderful that Hyatt thinks we're all marketers for the company,'' Ms. Heron said. ''Having the program is a good-will gesture and it shows you feel positive about the company.'' **********Anie Chinarian, assistant vice president for human resources at Hyatt, said that when its employees made referrals, ''they're saying that they want their friends and relatives to share in this.'' **********Whittman-Hart Inc., a consulting firm in Chicago with 1,000 employees, has paid a total of $400,000 to its workers since 1993 for making referrals. Jim Slattery, the principal in charge of recruiting, said the company had cut its recruiting costs by 38 percent, to $6,200 for each hire, since it began the referral program. Outside recruiters previously provided 20 percent of all new hires, he said, but provide only 3 percent now. **********''We save money, bring in people more suited to our firm, and employees have the chance to select whom their colleagues will be,'' Mr. Slattery said. **********Barry Lawrence, a spokesman with the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va., estimates that half of all companies with more than 500 employees have a referral program, although some  reward employees only with merchandise, like television sets, or by buying them lunch. **********ALTHOUGH Dr. Fernandez said it was difficult to generalize about the results of the study, he said ''they are suggestive to what other companies with programs are doing.'' He said the bank's referral program likely led to the strong showing of the applicants recommended by employees. **********Dr. Fernandez has begun a second study, to measure the job performance and turnover rates of referrals and nonreferrals. He said this study, involving 350 customer-service representatives in the bank's credit card division, should be completed by June."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/29/business/sec-accuses-a-fund-of-illegal-fee-use.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1997-05-29", "snippet": "Securities and Exchange Commission acuses Jerome L Dodson, portfolio manager of Parnassus Fund, one of largest mutual funds that practice 'socially responsible' investing, of illegal ue of brokerage commissions generated by the fund and of overval...", "word_count": 580, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

Dodson. In recent months, the S.E.C. chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., has focused attention not only on the soft-dollar issue but also on the duties of independent directors in protecting mutual fund investors. **********In an interview, Mr. Dodson, who is also president of the San Francisco-based money management firm that oversees the fund, said the fund, which has $274 million in assets, and its three trustees would mount a vigorous defense against the charges, which he said had no merit. **********''It seems like the S.E.C. is trying to seize on something highly technical to prove something that is not there,'' Mr. Dodson said. Given the S.E.C.'s increased scrutiny of the fund industry recently, he added, ''I think we got caught in a buzz saw.'' **********The S.E.C. said it would ask an administrative law judge to assess civil monetary damages as well as a cease-and-desist order against the fund management company, Parnassus Investments; Mr. Dodson; David L. Gibson, a San Francisco lawyer in private practice who has been a trustee since 1986, and Marilyn M. Chou, an executive vice president with the Xintec Corporation, a biomedical company in Oakland, Calif., who served as a fund trustee from 1985 to March 1996. **********The S.E.C. also contended that the fund had gone outside its fundamental investment policy in making a $100,000 loan to Margaux Inc., a company whose stock the fund owned. Mr. Dodson said the transaction was not a loan but rather an equity investment, in the form of a convertible debenture, which was made after Margaux filed for bankruptcy protection in March 1989. (It was liquidated in mid-1995.) **********The fund already owned 565,000 shares of Margaux stock, and from December 1990 through March 1993 the fund valued the stock and the debenture at $562,500, or roughly 37.5 cents a share. **********But the S.E.C. contends that during that period, the shares, which were not traded on any major American stock exchanges, were worth as little as 1 cent each. **********Investors who bought or sold shares in the mutual fund during that period did so at an incorrect share price, the S.E.C. said, a violation that was ''aided and abetted'' by the two independent trustees. **********The S.E.C. also contended that Parnassus Investments had improperly used $67,025 of soft-dollar credits generated by fund brokerage transactions between 1989 and 1995. The commission said the company used the money to buy computer hardware and software for use in providing accounting and transfer agent services to the fund. **********Mr. Dodson said that those purchases were made with the best interest of shareholders in mind and that the use of soft dollars had allowed the fund to lower the fees it charged investors for those services. In addition, he said, the management company paid back the $67,025 to the fund after the S.E.C. raised questions about the transactions in 1995."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/03/business/at-camp-potatochip-economics.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-08-03", "snippet": "Article by M Susan Hamilton on her entrepreneurial son who, after having spent six summers at camp, has mastered skills in selling or bartering food he brought from home (M)", "word_count": 816, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Camp, Potato-Chip Economics", "print_headline": "At Camp, Potato-Chip Economics", "body_text": " **********TWO cases bottled water. Check. Two cases instant soup packs.  Check. Two cases granola bars. Check. Two cases Pringles potato crisps. Check. Clothes, sneakers and sports gear. Check. **********So read the priority list as my 14-year-old son packed for camp earlier this summer. For four weeks, he played team tennis and casual lacrosse; he painted and sculpted and tie-dyed and designed macrame jewelry. But, as a budding entrepreneur, he also bartered bottled water for lacrosse balls, made a few dollars selling Pringles to the deprived, and then spent those dollars keeping the local Subway shop in business. **********My son knows the camp manual by heart; this was his sixth time at this summer playground in the Berkshires. So he is well aware that there is ''absolutely no food allowed in the bunks.'' Except, that is, in the unit head's cabin, the counselors' stashes and the campers' locked trunks. The authorities, it seems, generally look the other way. So the most important  skill is knowing how to keep track of trunk keys while wearing loopless, pocketless soccer shorts. Keeping track of the black-market food index, he said, is easy. **********The first week of camp, Pringles sell at close to market value, or $1.39 a cylinder. The second week, the price is $5, and the third week, just before Visitors Day, it's close to $10. **********''Where,'' I asked my son, ''do the kids get that kind of money?'' **********''Oh, easily,'' he replied, a little too blithely. **********Explaining the camp's business opportunities, he said: ''Everything is timing. You sell as little as possible in the first and second week, and wait until the kids are hungry enough. The peak selling time is the end of the third week, before the kids have spent money on camp trips and before their parents' trunkload of junk food arrives.'' **********Seasoned campers track food trends. My son's first letter home explained the importance: ''Mom, I missed the big wave. I brought plain Pringles. This year, the barbecue flavor is da-bomb,'' meaning the best. He had a solution, though: ''I traded a few cylinders for the upmarket barbecue, but I know I can sell off the plain ones, too.'' **********I was sure he could. At a local craft fair earlier this year, my son set up a booth among the adults, intending to sell custom-made macrame necklaces and bracelets. But he quickly switched to offering ''hair wraps'' to young girls -- braiding their hair with ribbons, macrame rope or embroidery thread -- when he sensed there might be a demand. He charged the girls $7 apiece, and the demand was so great that he had to enlist two friends to help when the line grew too long. He netted $150. **********When the campers, meanwhile, pocket some money from selling food, what do they do with it? Simple.  They buy more food -- namely, underground Subway sandwiches.  Footlong subs -- meatball, vegetarian or chicken -- can command $12  because there is only one direct delivery route: through a counselor whose favor a camper has curried. **********The second-most-prized item is pizza. But delivery is a bit dicier because the campers order it on their own. One boy, who had smuggled in a cell phone so he could call home whenever he wanted, once subcontracted the phone to another camper to order six pizzas. The order specified: ''Meet you at the electronic gate. If you see a 'big guy,' (a.k.a.a counselor), run to the other gate by the lake and I'll meet you there.'' **********My son said those pizzas arrived successfully. But on the next order, the delivery man had to avoid the main gate, then tripped on the run to the lake. He made the campers pay for the dropped pizzas. **********WHILE buying has its risks, selling bottled water is good business. The first and second weeks, all campers have enough bottled water under their bunks. The true marketeers stretch their stock into the third week, when supplies are thinning. The trick is to identify the big spenders. The tennis players, it seems, will pay almost any price to take their own water to the courts.  The soccer players are less fussy and the lacrosse players settle for the fungus-y water from the hose. **********So, did my son make any money this summer? **********''Mom, this year camp was my all-time best -- my food and water supply ran out just at the end,'' he said  when I picked him up last weekend. ''You'd be proud of me. I broke even.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/business/company-news-mellon-said-to-seek-founders-asset-management.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-09-18", "snippet": "Mellon Bank Corp is rumored to be leading contender to buy Founders Asset Management Co for as much as $300 million (S)", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MELLON SAID TO SEEK FOUNDERS ASSET MANAGEMENT", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; MELLON SAID TO SEEK FOUNDERS ASSET MANAGEMENT", "body_text": " **********The Mellon Bank Corporation is rumored to be the leading contender to buy the Founders Asset Management Company, a Denver-based mutual fund company, for as much as $300 million.

It acquired a sense of self-importance and destiny that President Karimov now seeks to embody. **********Mr. Karimov -- whose term of office expired in 1995 but was extended for five years after a referendum in which a reported 99.6 percent of the people voted to keep him in power -- also embodies the tradition of authoritarian rule that has dominated life here for centuries. **********With 23 million people, Uzbekistan is the most populous of the five Central Asian countries that emerged in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed, and senior officials make no secret of their ambition for regional leadership. The celebrations they are holding in Khiva and Bukhara, like their failed attempt to bring the Olympic Games to Tashkent, the capital, reflect their desire to lift Uzbekistan out of anonymity and make it a player in world affairs. **********The Central Asian republics are being courted by outside powers in part because of their strategic location between Russia, China, Iran and the Indian subcontinent. Their markets and resources, which include large oil and gas deposits, have only begun to be exploited. A country that can emerge as dominant in this region, Uzbek leaders reason, will have a voice in international politics. **********But those ambitions are stumbling over political and economic obstacles. Although Mr. Karimov insists that he is committed to reform, the habits he and other Uzbek leaders learned while rising through the Communist system have proved hard to break. Their plans for opening the country to democracy and foreign investment are clashing with their instinctive fear of losing control. **********Human rights conditions here have improved since the early 1990's and especially since President Karimov's visit to Washington last year. Still, there is no independent press, protest meetings are forbidden and opposition political parties are banned. **********But despite the slow pace of change, there is no ground swell of protest against the Government.  Two neighboring countries, Afghanistan and Tajikistan, have been consumed by ethnic and religious wars, and many Uzbeks seem willing to accept Mr. Karimov's heavy-handed rule as long as he keeps the country stable and at peace. **********''Ninety-nine percent of the people in this country don't even think about democracy and human rights,'' said Tohir Bokayev, a metalworker in Bukhara. ''Their main concern is everyday life. People here have no experience with Western-style democracy.'' **********Mr. Bokayev is trying to chip away at the monolith. He applied several months ago for permission to start an independent newspaper, and as he expected, it was denied. Now he plans to publish a newsletter that will carry only advertising and information like bus and train schedules. **********''You don't need permission to start a newsletter as long as it doesn't carry news,'' he said. ''I want to start this way, and then as time passes maybe we can expand it into a newspaper.'' **********As in most parts of the former Soviet Union, life is hard for most of Uzbekistan's people. Even in Tashkent it is unusual to find an ordinary person who earns more than $1,000 a  year. Prices are high, and many people find that rising costs have put health care and other social services out of their reach. **********Efforts to diversify the cotton-based economy depend largely on foreign investment, but corruption and broken promises have driven some investors away and deeply frustrated those who remain. **********Currency controls are so strict that foreign businesses often cannot withdraw their own money from banks. Local employees may not be paid in dollars, and companies that want to send Uzbeks abroad for training often find it impossible to obtain exit visas for them. **********To put it another way, conditions for foreign business here are so difficult that not even McDonald's has arrived yet. **********''They sign contracts without even reading them,'' a German hotel manager said. ''When you have a disagreement with a local partner, you tell him to look at what's written in the contract and he says: 'Contract? What's that?' '' **********The impulse that makes the Government reluctant to open the economy also leads it to equate political opposition with subversion. **********''Because of Karimov's authoritarian style, Uzbek society is stagnating,'' said Mikhail Ardzinov, leader of a human rights group the Government does not recognize. ''In Russia you see dynamic economic thinking and open debate about problems and possible solutions, but Karimov will not tolerate that here.'' **********Although the Government denies holding political prisoners, Mr. Ardzinov estimates that there are 32, nearly half accused of fomenting Islamic radicalism. The powerful security police keep close watch on mullahs and other religious figures, determined to prevent the growing interest in Islam from spilling over into politics. **********''I am very happy that our President is banning Islamic fundamentalism,'' said Dildora Alimbekova, a Tashkent seamstress who has formed an association of female entrepreneurs. ''I'm a bit surprised to see what is happening in my own family. I have 48 nieces and nephews. These young people are very interested in Islam, and half of my nieces are covering themselves in the old Islamic way. I discuss it with them, but they don't accept my point of view and argue strongly against me.'' **********Uzbekistan remains a decidedly secular country where there is no taboo against drinking alcohol or wearing short skirts and where one of the capital's most popular restaurants is called Pork Chop. But especially in the northeast Fergana region, the country's most densely populated, there are signs of an Islamic revival. **********At the bazaar in Kokand, one of the largest towns in Fergana, it is no longer unusual to see veiled women. Vendors sell cassettes on which prominent mullahs extol the virtues of religious education and belief. **********In Andijan, another Fergana town, a 60-year-old trader, Abdulrahim Abdulaim Oghli, said he had dreamed all his life of making the hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca but never believed it would be possible because such pilgrimages were banned by the Soviet authorities. **********''Now, praise Allah, I have made the hajj twice,'' he said. ''Since independence, people have followed their desire to become more religious. My grandson is reading the Koran and is about to finish it.'' **********President Karimov, though determined to prevent fundamentalism from taking hold, has sought to conciliate and co-opt the Muslim leadership rather than repress it. Always seeking to balance competing forces, he speaks warmly about Islam despite the fact that for years he served an officially atheistic system. **********Confronted with a choice about whether to make the hajj himself, which might set too strong a religious example, or to stay at home, which might offend practicing Muslims, Mr. Karimov came up with a typically adroit compromise. He traveled to Mecca, but although he visited holy sites he did it out of the hajj season so he would not seem to be encouraging excessive devotion. **********''You may not like Karimov, but most people think he's what we need at this moment in our history,'' said Odil Ruzaliev, a reporter for one of Tashkent's Government-controlled television stations. ''Let's give him a chance. In such a young country, why criticize?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/02/business/market-watch-these-good-times-will-end-with-a-whimper.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1997-11-02", "snippet": "Market Watch column on recent huge declines in Dow Jones industrial average; says investors will move from less attractice stocks to more attractive ones, but they will not get out of them market; graph (L)", "word_count": 616, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MARKET WATCH ; These Good Times Will End With a Whimper", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH ; These Good Times Will End With a Whimper", "body_text": " **********The bull market lives on, thanks to millions of Americans who did exactly what they had told pollsters they would do: They stayed calm when Wall Street panicked. Some even bought stocks. **********''All the new investors since 1987 learned that you should buy the dips,'' said Donald B. Marron, the chairman of Paine Webber. ''And that may be close to a majority of all investors.'' **********The panic on Monday set off the New York Stock Exchange's circuit breakers and forced all American markets to close early. It terrified people around the world, but not in Peoria, Ill. or Boise, Idaho. And that illustrated just how much Americans now believe in stocks as the one and only superior long-term investment. **********This panic was largely a matter of professional investors getting worried about the risks of collapsing prices, profits and banks in Asia. It will be interesting to see if it has a long-term effect on attitudes toward investing in emerging markets. But it is not likely to damage confidence in American stocks. **********Bears on the American stock market need to remember that stocks do not go up or down because of earnings, or interest rates, or because they are trading at ridiculous multiples of profits or sales. They go down when there are not enough buyers at a certain price. If something does not influence investors, it won't affect prices. **********That is why the stock market's high valuation is not very important right now. Investors will move from less attractive stocks to more attractive ones, but they will not get out of the market. **********Alan Greenspan, in his Congressional testimony last week, tried to gently criticize that attitude, saying that stock price gains since 1995 appear to be based on the assumption that profits would keep rising indefinitely from already high levels. He knows that is unlikely to happen and seems to regret his own public flirtation with the so-called new paradigm, which holds that this time is different. But his ability to influence the market is limited, assuming he is unwilling to raise interest rates enough to bring on a recession. **********Someday, of course, there will be a bear market. But it is unlikely to begin with a crash. As last week showed, even a very bad day will not shake a public that deeply believes in the long-term case for stocks. **********The more likely picture is a choppy market, followed by a slow decline, like the one in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Faith in stocks as sure things was strong then, as it is now. The Dow Jones industrial average peaked at 1,051.69 on Jan. 11, 1973, not far above where it had been a few years before. **********The 1973-74 bear market began slowly. Not until November, after the Dow was down 11.3 percent from the peak, did the market have a day in which prices fell by 2 percent. By then, there was obvious economic news to explain a weak stock market: an Arab oil embargo that was leading to the first oil price shock and a deep recession. The worst day of that bear market saw a 3.5 percent fall, less than half the decline that was seen last Monday. But by the time prices bottomed in late 1974, the Dow was off 45 percent from the peak. The worst days came near the end, not at the beginning, of the decline. **********It took months, and even years, of performance that fell below expectations before most investors got out. **********It will probably take a real recession to kill this bull, and then it will die slowly. But once it is dead, it may be a long time before a new bull is born. The 1973 high stood as a record until 1982."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/29/world/ira-admits-it-planted-2-bombs-in-england.html": {"writer_name": "James Clarity", "pub_date": "1997-03-29", "snippet": "IRA acknowledges detonating two bombs in Cheshire town of Wilmslow; link seen to British parliamentary campaign; bombs disrupted rail traffic, but injured no one (S)", "word_count": 496, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.R.A.

The caller, using a recognized code word to identify the call as coming from the I.R.A., did not refer to another bomb attack on Wednesday night, on a Royal Ulster Constabulary base in the British province of Northern Ireland. The police shot a suspected attacker and arrested him in a local hospital in Coalisland, County Tyrone. **********The attacks came as unconfirmed reports circulated here and in Northern Ireland that the I.R.A. was preparing to call a new cease-fire to replace the one it broke, after 17 months, on Feb. 9 last year. Since then I.R.A. attacks in England and Northern Ireland have killed five people, including three British soldiers, and injured several hundred. **********The Irish Times said in a front-page report on Thursday that ''senior security figures'' in Ireland ''are still hopeful that the I.R.A. is moving towards a second cease-fire.'' **********But the I.R.A., in a message Thursday, made no such suggestion, saying, ''We remain committed to bringing the British Government's undemocratic rule of the occupied part of our country to an end,'' using phrases that normally refer to violence. The message added that the organization was ''ready to face our responsibilities in facilitating a process aimed at securing a lasting resolution to the conflict,'' a reference to the efforts of its political wing, Sinn Fein. **********The message also praised I.R.A. prisoners who had attempted to escape from the Maze Prison, near Belfast, by digging a tunnel; the tunnel was discovered last Sunday. **********There is always speculation at Easter weekend that the I.R.A. may do something spectacular to mark the most important event in its history, the Easter Rising of 1916. On that Easter Monday, republicans began a weeklong insurrection against British colonial authorities. Southern Ireland gained independence in 1922, but the treaty with Britain, which left the six northern counties in British hands, was rejected by some republicans, who provoked a civil war with the new Irish Free State. **********The I.R.A. campaign, which accelerated in 1969, is to push the British authorities out of the North. Sinn Fein presses that goal politically; the party, which holds about one-third of the Catholic vote in the North, has candidates running in the British election, including Gerry Adams, its president. **********But because the I.R.A. broke its cease-fire last year, Sinn Fein has been excluded by the Irish and British Governments from the broad-based peace talks that began last June. The talks accomplished little, and they have been suspended until June 3, after the British election."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/26/business/on-the-information-highway-e-mail-litter-problem-grows.html": {"writer_name": "George Johnson", "pub_date": "1997-05-26", "snippet": "Junk E-mail, called spam, is jamming electronic mailboxes of companies that provide gateways to cyberspace; some Internet providers are trying to sue junk E-mailers for electronic trespassing; legal system is scrambling to catch up to problem; two...", "word_count": 1565, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "On the Information Highway, E-Mail Litter Problem Grows", "print_headline": "On the Information Highway, E-Mail Litter Problem Grows", "body_text": " **********Early one morning two weeks ago, Jason Lavoie, a network engineer for a company that provides Internet access in Maine, was rudely awakened by his beeper. There was trouble on the system that demanded immediate human intervention. **********Logging onto his computer to see what was wrong, Mr. Lavoie found hundreds of messages jamming his electronic mailbox -- complaints about a flood of commercial E-mail that appeared, to the untrained eye, to be coming from his employer, Maine Internetworks Inc. **********Before Mr. Lavoie could figuratively pull the plug, thousands of unsolicited advertisements for a company called Master Graphics in Fallbrook, Calif., had come coursing through Maine Internetworks' computer system and were relayed to Internet users across the country -- who were now letting him know how they felt about it. **********It did not matter that Master Graphics was not a client of Maine Internetworks -- Mint.net, for short -- which has strict rules against sending unsolicited commercial E-mail. The sender managed to hide his E-mail address from potentially angry Internet users by routing the mailing through Mint.net without permission or payment. Mr. Lavoie had to spend the rest of the day cleaning up the mess and plugging the security hole that allowed the computer to be infiltrated. **********''It costs us bandwidth and system resources, and it costs my time to respond to the complaints,'' Mr. Lavoie said. ''What the sender really is doing is shifting the cost of junk E-mail to the end user rather than to the person sending it.'' **********What happened to Mint.net occurs every day on the Internet. Junk E-mail, called spam, has been a problem ever since the public began to join scientists and academics on the Internet several years ago. But what was a trickle has become a torrent. **********Several times a week, and often several times a day, Internet users log on to America Online, Compuserve, Netcom or one of the many smaller companies that provide gateways to cyberspace and find an increasing number of shrill promotions clogging their electronic mailboxes: ''Make Big $$$ On Line -- Secret Revealed,'' ''Stuff for FREE!'' or ''You Can Now Dramatically Increase Your Sexual Attractiveness!'' **********While some Internet providers are trying to sue junk E-mailers for electronic trespassing, the legal system is scrambling to catch up to a problem rapidly becoming as obnoxious to many people as dinner-time telemarketing. Last week, two anti-spam bills were introduced in Congress, and the Federal Trade Commission will conduct a hearing on the problem next month. **********Wildcat entrepreneurs selling everything from software to sex have learned that it is so cheap to automatically crank out millions of messages that just a few sales can easily cover the cost. The irritation the mass mailings cause to everybody else is considered well worth the price -- especially with loads of new software making it easy for junk E-mailers to cover their tracks. **********Commercial mailers even spam the spammers. Last month, a mass E-mailing for a program called Stealth Mailer was sent by Fred@nowhere.com. ''Send Your E-Mail Out, At Up to 250,000 + Messages/Hour,'' the ad promised. To help the mailers escape detection, the program allows them to fake the return address and route the junk E-mail through different servers. Internet service providers ''will spin their wheels'' trying to track down the culprit, Fred@nowhere.com boasted. **********''Last year at this time, I'd get maybe a few junk E-mails a week,'' said Scott Hazen Mueller, vice president of engineering for Whole Earth Networks, an Internet service provider in San Francisco. ''Now I get 5 to 10 a day.'' Before Mr. Mueller tightened security, hit-and-run junk E-mailers were infiltrating the mail server at Whole Earth Networks several times a week. **********The problem is figuring out where the spam comes from and to whom one can complain. Federal law makes it illegal for companies to send unsolicited business faxes, but  there is no law preventing a junk E-mailer from writing the same unwanted message to millions of hard disks. **********Federal law also requires telephone marketers to stop calling people who complain about the intrusions, but complaints to junk E-mailers -- if they can be found -- are almost always ignored. **********In addition to disguising the source of their mailings by routing them through unsuspecting third parties, junk E-mailers commonly forge their electronic return addresses. The Master Graphics spam that jammed Mint.net's computer supposedly originated from an address in an Internet domain called Dcez.com, run by the DC Easy-Link Corporation in Alexandria, Va. But E-mail to the address was automatically returned marked ''User unknown.'' **********Anyone who wanted to complain directly to Master Graphics was confronted with another obstacle: The company has no listed phone number; only a street address was given for those who wanted to order the company's product, a digitized personal signature to use on computer-generated documents. An attempt to arrange an interview with Master Graphics' representatives by mail was unsuccessful. **********''You'd think that any business model that depends on alienating 99 percent of your target market would be guaranteed bankruptcy,'' said Stanton McCandlish of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a public policy group in San Francisco. ''If you get this type of advertisement, the sender is either a scam artist or totally clueless. It's time for the free ride to end. Why should the whole network have to pay for you to send eight million E-mails for free?'' **********Some service providers try to fight back by using filters to block mail from notorious spammers. But junk E-mailers just keep changing their Internet addresses, like mutating viruses eluding an immune system. And even blocking junk E-mail is costly, eating up a large amount of a service provider's computer time. **********Sensing that stopping junk E-mail has become a popular cause, Representative Chris Smith, Republican of New Jersey, introduced legislation last week that would broaden the law against junk faxes to include E-mail. Another bill introduced by Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, would require junk E-mail to be clearly labeled as an advertisement and include a real street address, E-mail address, telephone number and valid routing information. **********Some Internet denizens fear Senator Murkowski's approach would legitimize junk E-mail, and the idea of any kind of legislation runs contrary  to some people's libertarian view of the Internet. ''There is no way to legislate this problem away unless every single jurisdiction in the world adopts the same law,'' said Mr. McCandlish of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. **********But Mr. Mueller, who recently helped start a group called the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail, said a country that became a haven for junk E-mailers could be threatened with the ''Internet death penalty,'' having its connections to the United States cut off. **********Marc Rotenberg, head of the Electronic Privacy and Information Center, a nonprofit group in Washington, said a ban on junk E-mail might be unconstitutional. He thinks the flow could be stemmed by prohibiting the resale of E-mail addresses. **********''You don't have many people sending junk E-mail who are collecting the addresses themselves,'' he said. ''They are buying them from a broker. That's an area that we think could be regulated.'' **********Some large Internet service providers, fearing Government regulation and realizing that fighting spam can be a selling point in a competitive market, are going after junk E-mailers in the courts. Earlier this month, Earthlink in Palo Alto, Calif., won an injunction against Cyber Promotions of Philadelphia, one of the biggest junk E-mailers. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge found that Cyber Promotions had trespassed upon Earthlink's electronic territory and prohibited the mass E-mailer from sending advertisements through Earthlink's computers without permission. **********Sanford Wallace, the president of Cyber Promotions, which has also been the target of legal action by the on-line services Compuserve and America Online, insists that he has done nothing illegal and that his company is providing small businesses with a valuable service. ''E-mail is a fraction of the cost of any other medium, and it goes at the speed of light,'' he said in an interview. **********Cyber Promotions and its Internet service provider, Apex Global Information Services, called Agis.net, in Dearborn, Mich. -- one of the few service providers that allow junk E-mailing -- have tried to fend off possible regulation and counter bad publicity by promising to develop a universal list of consumers who have asked not to receive junk E-mail. **********And Cyber Promotions is collecting names -- 38,000 so far -- of people who have told the company they want to receive E-mail advertisements. ''That's Plan B,'' Mr. Wallace said. ''When and if a law says we can't do Plan A -- sending unsolicited E-mail -- then we will be prepared.'' **********But many Internet users, who feel violated when they find any kind of advertisement injected into their computers, are leery of such promises. Not all of them are willing to wait for a legal remedy or industry self-regulation. Earlier this month, a group of Internet users tried to crash Cyber Promotions' computers by sending a barrage of electronic messages. That assault was fended off, but the next day a more sophisticated hacker attack knocked the company off the Internet. **********Cyber Promotions was barely fazed. The next day it was back on line churning out millions of messages a day for its customers and selling software to help freelancers send junk E-mail. One of the products, Webcollector, crawls through the World Wide Web and harvests E-mail addresses. In the interest of diversification, the company also sells E-filter, which consumers can use to block Cyber Promotions' junk E-mail from their computers. **********The offering for the software was sent by junk E-mail."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/18/business/toolbox-to-handle-new-york-account.html": {"writer_name": "Dana Canedy", "pub_date": "1997-04-18", "snippet": "New York State Department of Economic Development says it has named Toolbox Communications in New York as lead creative agency to handle its spring and summer travel and tourism assignment, known as 'I Love New York' campaign; account had been han...", "word_count": 210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Toolbox to Handle New York Account", "print_headline": "Toolbox to Handle New York Account", "body_text": " **********The New York State Department of Economic Development said yesterday that it had named Toolbox Communications in New York as the lead creative agency to handle its spring and summer travel and tourism assignment, known as the ''I   New York'' campaign. **********The account had been handled by Ogilvy & Mather New York since January 1995.

Albright is making plans to meet in Europe next week with leaders from both sides, American and Israeli officials said today. **********Ms. Albright wants to show accomplishments and ''real momentum'' in Middle East peace efforts before she arrives at a Middle East economic conference in Doha, Qatar, on Nov. 16, the officials said. **********Arab countries, including America's allies like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have threatened to boycott the economic conference, or to send low-level delegations, because of the long Palestinian-Israeli deadlock that Ms. Albright is trying to crack. **********But James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said, ''We don't feel a greater sense of urgency about the Middle East peace process because of the Doha conference.'' **********Officials of all three sides said there was good will and seriousness at the talks this week, but no breakthroughs, especially on the larger issues. Those include Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation, a freeze on Israeli settlement activity and other provocative unilateral actions, the further withdrawal of Israeli  troops from the West Bank and how to move quickly to talks on a final settlement between the two sides, including the status of Jerusalem. **********On the pressing issues that matter most to the Palestinians: the troop withdrawal and final-status talks, there was no progress at all, officials said. The Israeli Foreign Minister, David Levy, could not negotiate serious alterations in the Israeli package, officials said, and the Palestinians rejected the idea of dealing with the issues as a package. **********That is why Ms. Albright wants to see the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, next week, in separate meetings, probably in London and Geneva. **********The two sides also discussed smaller questions, known as ''interim issues,'' which were supposed to have been settled 10 months ago. Those include a new airport for Palestinians in Gaza, a seaport, an industrial park and safe passage for Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Officials said no agreements were concluded because the details remain complicated and all the required experts were not here. For instance, officials said, while the airport is largely resolved, there are still details to be settled over how to schedule takeoffs and landings and air rights. On the seaport, the difficult issue of how to inspect shipments to insure Israeli security has not been worked out, they said. **********But Israeli and Palestinian officials were eager today not to criticize the other, and Mr. Levy and the Palestinian negotiator, Mahmoud Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, were complimentary. ''It's true that we did not reach any agreement in the different areas, but I can say that we did reach a great deal of understanding and common ground on each other's needs,'' Mr. Abbas said. **********Mr. Levy said, ''I believe that our work in this week has restored trust and has provided a good basis for our continued work, and I am returning home very satisfied.'' **********The Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Dore Gold, however, said today that the Palestinians were not heeding Ms. Albright's admonitions for a ''time out'' on provocative actions. ''It's outrageous that just as Israel is taking risks to conclude negotiations on a Palestinian airport in Gaza, the Palestinians are launching a four-pronged attack on Israel at the United Nations,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/29/business/if-deal-occurs-the-garden-faces-still-another-round.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Sandomir", "pub_date": "1997-01-29", "snippet": "Hilton Hotels Corp bid for ITT Corp, half owner of Madison Square Garden, could give Garden yet another new parent; Hilton might seek to sell stake; possible buyers include Fox Sports unit of News Corp (M)", "word_count": 762, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "If Deal Occurs, the Garden Faces Still Another Round", "print_headline": "If Deal Occurs, the Garden Faces Still Another Round", "body_text": " **********Once again, Madison Square Garden may have a new owner. **********In 1994, the Garden bounced from the ownership of Paramount Communcations to Viacom Inc. to a partnership of the ITT Corporation and the Cablevision Systems Corporation  for more than $1 billion. **********The sports and entertainment complex will gain a new parent if the Hilton Hotels Corporation succeeds in its $6.5 billion unsolicited bid for ITT. If Hilton wins, it may seek to sell its half-interest in the Garden to focus on the hotel and casino businesses. Analysts say the Garden may be worth between $650 million and $1 billion. **********Although there are several possible suitors, Fox Sports, a unit of the News Corporation, is being mentioned as one company that would have much to gain by acquiring the arena because of its battle to get the Fox News Channel carried on cable television in New York. **********''Fox could be in the hunt for it because it would give them tremendous leverage to get the Fox News Channel on in New York City,'' said Bob Gutkowski, the former president of the Garden and now the president of the Marquee Group, a sports and entertainment marketing company. Time Warner has refused to place the Fox News Channel on its New York City cable television system, arguing that there are already enough such channels. **********Mr. Gutkowski added that Fox Sports would also get ''the best regional sports network in the business -- the MSG Network -- the Knicks, the Rangers and the building.'' **********Fox Sports is a partner with Liberty Media, a unit of Tele-Communications Inc., in a regional cable sports service, Fox Sportsnet, which owns or is affiliated with sports channels around the country. The venture would covet the addition of the MSG Network, a highly profitable division of the Garden, which has 5.4 million subscribers. Liberty showed its interest in the Garden in 1994, when it made an unsuccessful bid of $1 billion to acquire it. **********Fox Sports, though, was noncommittal yesterday. ''It's premature,'' Vince Wladika, a spokesman for Fox Sports, said. ''But we find ourself again on the list of usual suspects.'' **********Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation's chairman, also has been said to be a potential buyer of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team and any new National Football League team in Los Angeles. **********But the Garden is expected to be alluring to other companies. Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp Ltd., a sports consulting firm, said that the Garden would appeal to a large investment firm like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company because of its cash flow. A spokesman for Kohlberg Kravis declined to comment. **********Michael Ozanian, deputy editor and sports valuation expert at Financial World, said that a possible route for Hilton, if it acquires ITT, would be to sell its stake in the Garden to the public. Recently, H. Wayne Huizenga spun off 49 percent of his Florida Panthers hockey team at $10 a share. The stock price has since tripled. **********If Hilton buys ITT and wants to auction its 50 percent stake in the Garden, it would have to go through Cablevision, which has the option to buy ITT's share. In a statement yesterday, the cable system operator, which is based in Woodbury, L.I., said the Garden properties were ''important assets for Cablevision and we will maintain our ownership.'' **********But Cablevision could be unwilling or unable to buy out ITT's stake, whatever its worth. Cablevision is loaded with debt, and it lost $232.9 million in the nine months ended Sept. 30. It also has yet to repay the loan it received from ITT to acquire its stake in the Garden. **********Harold Vogel, an analyst with Cowen & Company, said that the Garden was worth more than the $1 billion Cablevision and ITT paid in 1994 because of increased cash flow since the acquisition, greater efficiencies in its operations and greater use of the arena. **********''It's in pretty good shape for a higher price,'' Mr. Vogel said. **********Other experts said that despite quadrupling cash flow since 1993 to between $80 million and $90 million last year, Garden management has squeezed as much as it can from operations and has reached the limit on ticket-price increases. ''I'd say it's worth $650 million to $725 million,'' said David Wolfe, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. He said the high cost of player salaries would be a problem for any buyer. **********Another ITT asset Hilton might shed is WBIS-TV, a new business and sports station ITT acquired jointly with Dow Jones & Company for $207 million. ''People in the TV business could be interested in a station with access to the New York-New Jersey market,'' Mr. Vogel said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/07/business/inside-468665.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INSIDE", "print_headline": "INSIDE", "body_text": " **********INVESTING IT /Page 4/ **********Two high-energy stock plays to consider: food irradiation and laser eye surgery.

A resident of Dix Hills, L.I., he was 80 and had been chairman of Osrow Products, the company he founded to produce an array of novel household items he had helped tinker into being. **********His family said the cause was lung cancer. **********In an age in which the development of increasingly complex computers and other electronic products  transformed American society, Mr. Osrow was an inventor who concentrated on the simple things of life: the broom, for example. **********There had been brooms before Mr. Osrow came along, and they swept well enough, but until he and his younger brother Leonard introduced the Osrow Twin-Sweep in 1947, households needed a variety of brooms. The sleek aluminum Osrow, which became something of a sensation at Macy's, not only adjusted from a push broom to an upright, it also came with separate broomhead attachments, for indoor or patio use, that made it four brooms in one. **********To Mr. Osrow, a native of Jamaica, Queens, who briefly attended City College before serving with the Army in World War II, such inventiveness was something of a family tradition. His father, who owned a garment business, had been a tinkerer who obtained half a dozen patents over the years. **********Indeed, it was one of his father's leftover inventions, a hand-held dishwasher, that gave Mr. Osrow his start. The Osrow dishwasher was simply a brush attached to a hose that slipped over the kitchen faucet, but while it sold well enough to lead Mr. Osrow to brooms and beyond, it was its increasingly complex car-washing derivative with soap dispensers and swirling brushes that made Osrow a mainstay in the automotive products field. **********Like other inventors who often have accidental brainstorms, Mr. Osrow, who eventually held more than 30 patents, made a small fortune on a false start. In an effort to develop a portable windshield defroster that would attach to a car's cigarette lighter, he tested a prototype plug-in model in the freezer unit of his home refrigerator one night. When all the excess ice melted away in a manner of minutes he repackaged his idea as a defroster that proved popular until the advent of self-defrosting refrigerators. **********As for all that ice buildup on car windshields, Mr. Osrow abandoned his idea for a battery-powered defroster in favor of one that ran on elbow grease -- a plastic windshield scraper cum snow brush that proved so popular that Mr. Osrow sold them by the millions every year. **********As other products were added, the company, started in accordance with ancient entrepreneurial tradition in a garage in Ridgewood, Queens, expanded rapidly until it occupied a 120,000-square-foot factory with 350 employees in Old Bethpage, L.I. At its peak in the early 1980's it had sales of about $10 million a year. **********For all of Mr. Osrow's fascination with gadgetry, one of the company's more popular products, a cordless iron, reflected his marketing savvy. **********In addition to paying more for convenience, he once explained, consumers will spring for a cordless item ''because of the mystery of it.'' **********Still, the mainstays for Mr. Osrow's company, which introduced the talking ice cream machine (it played ''Happy Days are Here Again,'' when the ice cream was done) were products designed to make life easier. **********Unfortunately, one of its most popular products, a home pasta-making machine, proved the company's undoing when it was established that another company had invented it first. The resulting patent-infringement suit led Osrow Products into bankruptcy in the mid 1980's, although several of the company's products are still sold under the Osrow name by other companies. **********Mr. Osrow may have lost his company, but he still had his old eye for invention. Forming a new company, P.T.H.Y. (for ''products that help you''), he helped develop a commercial fudge-making machine, and when that enterprise failed he shouldered on. **********Just two weeks before his death he was working on his latest brainstorm, a coffee table that rises and converts to a full-size dining table. **********Mr. Osrow, whose first marriage ended in divorce, is survived by his wife, Laura; three children from his first marriage, Richard of West Bayshore, L.I.; Laurel of Manhattan, and Terry of Huntington, L.I.; his wife's two children by a previous marriage, Perry Sann of Summit, N.J. and Steven Sann of Port Washington, L.I., and four grandchildren."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/15/business/china-will-lend-thais-1-billion.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-08-15", "snippet": "China will extend $1 billion in special credit to Thailand (S)", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Will Lend Thais $1 Billion", "print_headline": "China Will Lend Thais $1 Billion", "body_text": " **********China said today that it would extend $1 billion in special credit to Thailand, demonstrating a new link to other Asian nations. **********Beijing in recent years has rarely given financial aid beyond a few Communist countries.

Earlier, Upjohn had disappointing results with Rogaine, a treatment for hair loss, and a drug for stroke and brain trauma that is still not ready for marketing, Mr. Mehta noted. **********Ms. Haggar said Pharmacia & Upjohn, like other big drug makers, would have to make licensing deals for promising drugs developed by smaller and foreign companies, while it waited for its own pipeline to produce.

Several retailers greatly increased their advertising budgets this fall, flooding women's magazines with image campaigns to let shoppers know that they, too, are a brand, just like Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren. **********At Talbots Inc., for example, an extra $13 million was earmarked this fall for a campaign, created by Arnold Communications, to tell shoppers that the store was returning to its roots in classic styles. In 1995, the company, spent only ''a few million dollars'' on advertising, said Margery Myers, a Talbots spokeswoman. Part of that money was also spent to spiff up the company's other marketing devices, like its shopping bags. **********The campaign depicts women wearing very uncomplicated looks -- a simple red suit, a white blouse or a heavy fisherman's sweater -- while going about daily tasks such as walking the children to school, preparing dinner or getting a parking ticket. **********''This campaign underscores that we are the headquarters for classics and will be doing them for years on,'' Ms. Myers said. ''We wanted to show what classics meant in today's life styles. Our market is 35 to 55, and most women in that segment are juggling multiple roles. They want to convey they care a lot about looking good and stylish, but they don't want to spend any time on it.'' **********Talbots is badly in need of a shot in the arm; sales have been weak all year, and the retailer has alienated its regular customers, with overly trendy offerings. **********Meanwhile, executives from the Ann Taylor Stores Corporation said that their fall campaign was the biggest one ever for the specialty retailer, whose sales have lagged in the last couple of years. Although the company would not disclose its budget, it said that it spent an extra $2 million this fall to put advertisements in nine women's magazines. In 1995, Ann Taylor had no fall campaign at all. **********''This campaign was designed to build top-of-mind awareness,'' said Catherine Sadler, the executive vice president of marketing at Ann Taylor. ''And to position us as accessible and relevant to our customers' lives.'' **********Translation: an advertisement that features a shirt, jacket, hat and pants shows that the store sells many interchangeable separates, and the fact that a woman is studying while wearing one Ann Taylor outfit and skipping about in a carefree manner in another shows that one can wear these clothes in all types of situations. **********''This is the first time I have seen all these retailers at once trying to get across the message of the attributes of their brand,'' said Maura Hunter Byrne, a retail analyst at J. P. Morgan. **********''Last year, the women's businesses in the department stores got a lot of attention because they were introducing the Lauren line, and Tommy and Nautica things,'' Ms. Byrne said. ''The Gap was losing market share, Talbots had problems and Ann Taylor brought in consultants. Now, it is all about their name being a brand name and needing to think just like branded products.'' **********Nine West Group, the shoe store chain, has also climbed on board in a big way. In a nine-page advertisement shot by the fashion photographer Herb Ritts and produced in-house, the company goes to great lengths to portray itself as a sexy  fashion brand and not just a store doling out everyday navy pumps. **********The advertisements were shot with a hazy orange glow. Each page shows a different product, like a wine-colored leather purse, or a trendy pair of ankle boots, or a pair of fishnet tights -- again stressing the depth of the retailer's product line. **********Although the company would not disclose its budget for this campaign, it spent ''50 percent more than last year,'' said Stacy Lastrina, vice president of corporate marketing for Nine West. ''Today brands are built emotionally,'' Ms. Lastrina said.

Even after it shifted course and gave a tentative go-ahead in January 1996, the final details took nearly a year to be resolved. **********Iraqi oil did begin to flow again last Dec. 9, an event accompanied by lavish ceremonies and celebratory gunshots in the streets, but it took nearly three months before the first shipment of food -- chick peas, white beans and cooking oil from Turkey -- arrived. **********A special United Nations committee in New York has blocked or put on hold nearly half of the contracts for food and other goods that have been submitted under a cumbersome approval process for which the Iraqis blame American interference. **********As late as April, so few supplies of food and other goods had arrived in Iraq that the monthly ration provided by the Government to its 22 million citizens remained essentially unchanged. Rations were increased by a few pounds of flour per person only after the Government agreed to draw 40,000 tons of wheat from its own strategic reserves. **********But in the last two months a burgeoning flow by land and sea has brought a total of 550,000 tons of food and other goods into Iraq, where they are being distributed by Iraqi officials under United Nations supervision. In the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, which lie outside the control of the Baghdad Government, the distribution is handled by United Nations agencies. **********Sugar and tea remain in short supply and the quantities distributed to Iraqis this month remained unchanged. But the supplies of all other goods have been considerably bolstered, increasing the average daily calorie allotment by about 90 percent, to about 2,300 per day. **********The package still does not include meat or eggs, and it provides milk only for youngsters less than one year old. As many as one in four Iraqi children still suffer from some form of malnutrition, United Nations officials say, and most Iraqis still find it necessary to buy some goods on the open market, where a dozen eggs can consume about half a government worker's monthly salary. **********''It's a drop in the bucket,'' Iraq's Information Minister, Hamid Yousef Hammadi, said of the help provided by the oil-for-food agreement, although he quickly added, ''It's better than nothing.'' **********The United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq, Steffan de Mistura, declined in an interview to say  whether he thought the oil-for-food deal should be extended, but his comments left his sentiments clear. **********''The needs of the population are clearly identified, and they are large,'' he said. **********Under the accord, Iraqi is permitted to sell only about one-fifth of the oil that it did before the Persian Gulf war. Of the $2 billion that it was permitted to earn from the sale of oil in the six months that will end on June 9, nearly 30 percent has been set aside to settle the claims of those displaced by the war and to pay for the costs of United Nations operations here. **********But still, from those limited oil sales alone, the plan sets aside $805 million for food, $65 million for soap and detergent, $210 million for medicine, and tens of millions more for projects to improve electricity, water, agriculture and education. **********Some Western diplomats say they worry that the scheme may simply allow the Government of President Saddam Hussein to divert resources that it once had to spend on food toward darker purposes. They say these could include efforts to rebuild weapons systems that Iraq has been compelled to destroy under the United Nations resolutions that were imposed after the Persian Gulf war. **********But people in Baghdad who have  begun to taste life's simplest pleasures again would rather talk about how their lot is improving. **********''It smells nice, it cleans better, and at least it has a pretty color,'' said one of several woman who volunteered their praise, unprompted, for the pinkish bars of Jordanian soap passed out at a monthly ration of one and a half per person. ''We all still have big problems, but I'm beginning to feel a little better about the little ones.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/27/world/tools-to-fix-space-station-to-arrive-in-2-weeks.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1997-06-27", "snippet": "Russian space officials say that it will take two weeks to transport vital repair equipment to stricken Mir space station, which was seriously damaged when unmanned Progress cargo vessel slammed into it on June 25 (M)", "word_count": 571, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tools to Fix Space Station to Arrive in 2 Weeks", "print_headline": "Tools to Fix Space Station to Arrive in 2 Weeks", "body_text": " **********Russian space officials said today that it would take two weeks to transport vital repair equipment to the stricken Mir space station . **********The station was seriously damaged on Wednesday when an unmanned Progress cargo vessel slammed into it, curtailing Mir's power supply and forcing the two Russians and an American on board to seal off one of its seven compartments, the Spektr module. **********Yuri Koptev, chief of the Russian Space Agency, said that another unmanned Progress cargo craft would be launched in 11 days with special equipment for repairs. It takes about two days for the Progress to reach the space station. **********''The astronauts will have to make a space walk to complete the repairs to the Spektr module,'' Mr. Koptev said. ''For that, special equipment should be delivered.'' **********In a conversation with NASA officials in Houston today, Michael Foale, the American astronaut aboard Mir, said he and his two  crewmates were feeling fine and adapting to the cramped, dark conditions on the station. **********Mr. Foale's personal belongings and most of his scientific equipment and experiments are in the sealed-off Spektr module. Asked what gear he would like to have included in the supply ship scheduled to visit Mir, Mr. Foale requested a medical kit to replace one left in the damaged module, a shaver, a toothbrush, three tubes of toothpaste and a pair of shoes. **********Frank Culbertson, NASA's director of the Mir space shuttle cooperative program, said at a news conference in Houston that United States experts were helping assess the damage to Mir and would help with repairs if the Russians requested it.  It is unlikely that NASA would move up the next scheduled visit of an American space shuttle to the Russian station, now planned for late September, he said. **********Mr. Culbertson said that before sending an astronaut, Wendy Lawrence, up to Mir on that flight to replace Mr. Foale, NASA had to determine that the stay would be safe and that there would be worthwhile research for her to do in light of the loss of perhaps half of the United States equipment aboard Mir. **********As Russian and NASA officials met here to discuss possible repairs,  Russian officials repeated that they had no plans to evacuate the Mir, a procedure that might result in the loss of the space station. The Mir  generally needs to be manned to stay in the proper orbital pattern over an extended period, said an American official. He said the Russians had a multibillion dollar investment in the Mir and would try to preserve it as long as there was no danger to the crew. **********But the Russians were not minimizing the seriousness of the accident and said they were prepared to order an evacuation if air pressure fell precipitously. So far, the air pressure in the undamaged part of the craft is satisfactory, Russian officials said. **********A major problem is the loss of much of the vessel's power. The power problem developed after the Progress cargo vehicle destroyed a solar array and damaged cables to other solar arrays while the crew of the Mir was practicing a docking maneuver. **********NASA officials said on Wednesday that half of the power had been lost but Russian officials said today that electrical power had been cut 25 percent to 30 percent.

Fears about a mushrooming budget deficit and the suspension in July of balance-of-payments loans from the International Monetary Fund caused the Zimbabwe dollar to tumble last week, prompting the government to impose stiff foreign-exchange controls Tuesday. **********The situation has raised concerns that Southern Africa could be caught up in the recent financial maelstrom emanating from Southeast Asia just as the region was beginning to see its best economic growth in decades. The countries of the Southern African Development Community had growth averaging 4 percent in 1996, and political leaders are hoping to translate the region's new peace and political stability into sustainable development. **********Mr. Mugabe said the veterans' payments were an essential act of social justice that would help alleviate poverty among some 60,000 former soldiers who fought to topple Zimbabwe's white-minority government in the 1970s. He said the country would finance the one-time payment of about 4.5 billion Zimbabwe dollars ($352.9 million) out of its own resources and told foreign investors they should not be concerned. **********The funds \"won't come from investment capital,\" he said at a conference on Southern African trade and investment here, organized by the International Herald Tribune. **********In Harare on Tuesday, Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa of Zimbabwe unveiled an emergency austerity package of spending cuts, tax increases and foreign-exchange controls.

Many economists say the government can ill afford the payments with the budget deficit already soaring.

I'm told one can make a lot of money as a cook at the South Pole. How do I go about getting a job there? **********ELLIOTT PRAG **********Detroit **********A. East Hampton it's not. Even the masochistically inclined will tell you there are better places below the Equator to get a kitchen job this fall than in Antarctica, the world's coldest, driest, windiest and most remote continent, where summer temperatures range from a balmy 40 degrees Fahrenheit to 40 below. **********Picture a land one-fifth larger than the United States and Mexico, 98.4 percent of it covered by ice and the rest by wind-scoured rocks. Since the establishment of the Little America encampment by Adm. Richard E. Byrd in 1929, the United States has had a major presence there, exploring the polar region, its ecosystems and climate, using the vast ice shield as a scientific platform for studying not only the earth's upper atmosphere but also near-outer space. It was in Antarctica, site of the cleanest air in today's world, that we first learned the character and causes of the ozone hole, of global warming and, from a meteorite pried out of  the ice, of the possibility of extraterrestrial life on Mars. **********More revelations may be forthcoming. By 2005, the 25-year-old dome-shaped South Pole station will undergo a multimillion-dollar renovation that will require much manpower and should greatly increase the ability to do modern scientific research. **********Still, considering that for now, fewer than 200 people a year make the three-hour ski-plane flight from the main American base at McMurdo Sound to work at the geographic South Pole, I don't think there will be much demand for a sous-chef. But whoever works in the kitchen at the Amundsen-Scott polar station will still need an aptitude for creative cooking. Much of the fare is canned, frozen or freeze-dried, though bread is baked fresh daily and soups are made from scratch. One specialite de la maison is ''buzz bars'' -- brownies with chocolate-covered espresso beans baked into them. **********Food supplies, flown in periodically from New Zealand, often arrive in odd proportions; for instance, a huge bundle of green onions, but no lettuce or any other salad makings. This might lead one to ponder the fortunes awaiting the person who sets up Antarctica's first sled-through fast-food joint. **********Seriously, your source was probably referring to joining the support staff at one of the three American scientific research facilities and two ships operated under the aegis of the National Science Foundation. Each year, the United States (one of 26 nations studying Antarctica) deploys about 650 people to perform scientific research and an additional 2,500 to fill an array of support jobs in areas like global communications, data entry, hospital services, safety training, housing construction, vehicle maintenance, firefighting, housekeeping, waste management, recreation, airfield crash rescue, janitorial services and, yes, food handling. Those numbers will grow with the renovation project. **********(The National Science Foundation will also provide field support for a few artists, writers, historians and scholars who wish to  experience the bottom of the world, though it will not pay them.) **********Most jobs require an uninterrupted four- to six-month stint during the austral summer months, October through February. The ranks thin during the winter months, when the weather can be diabolical: temperatures as low as 117 degrees below zero, hurricane-strength winds and blinding snowstorms that can last three or more days. Despite all this, many workers go back for more. **********While there are no hardship bonuses, the pay for nonscientific work isn't bad. Salaries are based on Denver-area wages and range from $300 a week for unskilled labor to $1,200 for managers and those with technical skills. A cook makes $400 to $600 for a 54-hour workweek plus a 16 percent bonus for completing the stint. A repeat visit would earn a 5 percent base pay increase and an 18 percent completion bonus. **********However, you would probably save more money than if you worked stateside because your expenses are paid and, well, there aren't many places to spend your money (though there is an A.T.M. at McMurdo Station). Rob Holmes, a meteorologist who has worked several stints at an Antarctica  weather station, says he has his paychecks deposited directly into his bank account, collecting interest until his return to Oregon, Wis. **********The research stations are small communities, with a variety of jobs and activities.  Off-hour pursuits include hiking, cross-country skiing, crafts, sports, movies, and -- surprise -- science lectures. **********''There's a small PX-like store for souvenirs, alcohol and toiletries, a few bars and you can always order from Lands' End or L. L. Bean,'' Mr. Holmes said. ''Just don't ask for overnight delivery.'' **********That's some Antarctish humor, because the sun never sets during part of the summer, so there is no night. E-mail, satellite TV and Internet access have also lessened the isolation, so you don't have to worry about arriving at McMurdo, the only United States installation south of Guantanamo Bay with a bowling alley, and being greeted by a bunch of hirsute green-stamp collectors grabbing at your lapels and demanding, ''Who shot J.R.?'' **********If you are interested in nonscientific work in Antarctica, you can get in touch with the  Antarctic Support Associates in Englewood, Colo., (800 688-8606, extension 3198), the main contractor supplying the National Science Foundation with support staff. The contractor usually starts accepting summer job applications in April. **********The process is essentially the same as seeking employment stateside unless you specifically ask for a ''winter-over'' job.  Those who do will have to pass a psychological test and an extensive physical exam because medical care is limited and emergency evacuation impossible during the winter. **********Some winter workers are advised to travel extremely light -- in particular, by getting rid of their impacted wisdom teeth before embarking. Pregnant women need not apply. **********Incidentally, more women than ever are signing up for Antarctic duty, noted Rebecca L. Johnson, author of ''Braving the Frozen Frontier: Women Working in Antarctica'' (Lerner, 1997, $17.96). **********''You'll see women working in all the traditionally male-dominated fields, including construction and engineering,'' she said, finding remarkably little sexism on the job. ''Ironically, there's a larger percentage of men working in food service.'' **********After their selection, the workers go to Christchurch, on New Zealand's South Island, where they receive their cold-weather gear, take a safety training course and then take a five-hour flight to McMurdo Station. **********To pursue study in Antarctica as a scientist or research assistant, one may call the National Science Foundation (703 306-1234) or visit its Web site at http://www.nsf.gov/. **********''Antarctica is the place for scientists in many disciplines to really make their mark,'' said Dr. Bernard Stonehouse, an authority on Antarctica at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, England, and author of the forthcoming ''Antarctica, the Traveller's Guide'' (Harold Martin & Redman, 1997, $21.95). **********Coincidentally, say a number of travel-trend spotters, Antarctica beckons as a destination for plucky tourists. This year, more than 12,000 visitors are expected to touch down on ''the ice.'' By the millennium, as many as 20,000 will head for the Penguin Trail annually. In anticipation, Lonely Planet Publications last year published ''Antarctica,'' a 362-page guidebook aimed specifically at such intrepid travelers, and sold a bundle of them at $17.95 each. **********But what is the appeal, if not the free ice? ''It's an expensive adventure holiday for people that have been everywhere and want to view magnificent, unspoiled alpine scenery, sculpted ice, penguins, wildlife, and enjoy some history,'' Dr. Stonehouse said. And, of course, some travelers collect continents and need that elusive seventh. **********Dr. Stonehouse says more than a few seasoned American tourists trace their decision to encounters with Admiral Byrd in the 1930's. He is said to have ended many a lecture by patting the heads of schoolchildren and insisting, ''You must go there someday.'' Apparently, now in their 60's and 70's and with 401(k) money to spare, those kids are taking him at his word. **********Dr. Stonehouse also says Antarctica has been climatically maligned. **********''Individuals have experienced much worse weather during winters in the northern Midwest and Canada than they'll find in Antarctica during the summer,'' he said.  ''I've met some elderly ladies from the Bronx who hadn't walked more than 50 yards in the last 10 years and were having a fine time.'' **********That may be all well and good, but frankly, having spent 17 years growing up outside frigid Buffalo, I'll pass on any more cold-weather duty, thank you. **********Questions about investing, careers and personal finance can be sent to Minding Your Business, Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036.

A quarter-point rise in the cost of overnight money, to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent, after the meeting Tuesday of Federal Reserve Board policymakers is now widely considered a foregone conclusion. **********Beyond that, the consensus breaks down. Will it be a one-off increase? \"Unlikely,\" said John Lipsky at Chase Manhattan Bank. \"It would seem trivial to try to fine-tune monetary policy to such a degree,\" he said, adding that he expected the federal funds rate to be at least 5.75 percent by the end of the year. **********Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley & Co. said that \"this is not a central bank that is about to squander years of hard-won credibility over a measly 25 basis points \u2014 the increase should be viewed as the first of many\" en route to 6.50 percent by the end of the year. **********His is an admittedly extreme view, but if correct, it exposes a rocky road for European bonds, which are not only influenced by developments in New York but also have their own problems, notably whether the planned monetary union proceeds and, if so, with which countries. **********In Europe, uncertainties about monetary union are driving investors out of the higher-yielding peripheral bond markets \u2014 Italy, Spain, Sweden \u2014 which continued to sell off last week. Fears of a delay and signs of strong German growth buoyed the Deutsche mark, but yields on 10-year government bonds ended the week almost a quarter point higher at 5.92 percent. **********The problem for investors is that they have no way of knowing what is likely to happen. U.S. economic data indicate a faster-than-expected rate of growth but with inflation still contained. Only subsequent data over the coming months will offer a clue as to how much further, if at all, the Fed needs to tighten. **********One irony of the current situation is that investor confidence in the Fed's ability to contain inflation is so high that long-term interest rates have barely moved. The benchmark 30-year government bond currently yields 6.96 percent, compared with 6.72 percent at the start of the year. **********Had the rise been sharper, the increase in the cost of money would have been causing a natural restraint on the upswing. But without that added drag, the Fed may be forced to push up more sharply the short-term rates it controls. **********As rates in the bond futures market already incorporate an increase in the cost of borrowing dollars, no big reaction is expected after Tuesday's announcement. The market reaction will be \"muted,\" said Avinash Persaud at J.P.

A bit more expensive than hot cakes, the hands were still going fast, she said. ''We've got two left.'' **********And because Hong Kong is Hong Kong, speculators have been frantically trying to figure out what will increase in value and what won't. It seems that neither the last commemorative coin set issued under British rule nor the coins still in circulation bearing the visage of the Queen will have much lasting value. Despite the onset of Chinese rule, nearly 2.2 billion coins sporting the Queen are still in circulation. **********Then there are car license plates, an assemblage of letters and numbers that often attract frantic bidding if a particularly auspicious series of numbers comes up for auction. The combination 8888 is about as precious as it gets, since 8 in Cantonese also sounds like the word for good fortune. **********So one would have thought that a plate reading HK1997 would be particularly sought after. Alas, it was not to be when the plate's owner, who bought it cheaply years ago, failed to get the price he was seeking: $600,000.

She settled on a T-shirt that read ''One Country, Two Systems,'' a slogan coined by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to describe Hong Kong's somewhat autonomous relationship with the mainland. **********China's effort to cash in on the hoopla, however, seems to have gone awry. ''The Opium War,'' the most expensive movie made in China, a didactic extravaganza depicting Britain's armed forces ramming opium down China's throat, has flopped at the box office. Steven Spielberg's new movie, ''The Lost World,'' about dinosaurs, is in town and lines stretch around the block. **********Patriotism may be the theme of the day, but James Wong Jim, a well-known local actor, songwriter and flamboyant master of ceremonies, backed out of serving as host at one of the televised celebrations because he was asked to donate his talents to the festivities. **********''I am a professional master of ceremonies,'' Mr. Wong told a local paper.

The results surprised Wall Street analysts, who had predicted another loss for the nation's largest on-line service provider. **********America Online's advertising revenue surged while marketing costs were forced lower as part of a legal settlement with state attorneys general that forced the company to cut back its advertising. **********As a result, the company earned  $2.6 million, or 2 cents a share, on revenue of $456.2 million, for the quarter, which ended on March 31. Analysts polled by First Call had expected a loss of 7 cents a share. **********The modest earnings were a retreat from the $15.1 million profit the company posted in its third quarter a year ago, but marked a significant improvement from more recent results. Over the previous two quarters, the company had posted a combined loss of $508.5 million. **********''I think we have turned the corner as relates to returning to profitability and we anticipate seeing progress in the future quarters,'' Stephen M. Case, America Online's chairman, said. ''The progress we saw this quarter provides greater confidence in the soundness of our strategy.'' **********A cornerstone of that strategy was repositioning America Online as a media company along the lines of a magazine or newspaper, one that sells its product for about what it costs to make and hopes to make most of its profits from advertising. **********In February the company signed up its largest marketing client, Tel-Save Holdings Inc., a long-distance telephone operator. Tel-Save, which buys long-distance time in bulk and resells it at a profit, paid America Online what amounted to a $100 million advance. **********America Online booked about $12 million of that fee this past quarter, helping overall advertising and transaction revenue jump more than threefold to $60.7 million. **********Following the media-company model and forced to compete against companies that offer low-cost connections directly to the Internet, America Online abolished most per-hour charges in December. In their place, it established an ''all you can eat'' plan, offering unlimited access to the service for $19.95 a month. **********Users flocked to the service, but America Online's infrastructure could not handle the demand. **********Prodded by users, attorneys general from 36 states negotiated an agreement with America Online that required the company to offer refunds to many subscribers and to drastically curtail its advertising. **********So the company's marketing costs fell by almost 40 percent, from $146.8 million in the quarter that ended in December to $89.5 million in the most recent quarter. Mr. Case said the company intended to reduce marketing costs all along. **********Some analysts questioned whether America Online could sustain its profitability, noting declining gross profit margins and the artificially low marketing expenses. But others were ebullient. **********''They can turn on the engines now,'' said Alan M. Braverman, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''They've just scratched the surface with advertising and electronic commerce. I think the earnings are very sustainable.'' **********America Online did not announce the earnings until after financial markets closed. But shares of America Online began to rise almost immediately after the New York Stock Exchange opened yesterday, finishing the day at $51.50, up $4.25. **********Before the markets opened, Hambrecht & Quist, a West Coast brokerage firm, announced that it had initiated coverage of America Online with a ''buy'' rating. Hambrecht & Quist's chief executive, Daniel H. Case 3d, is a brother of Mr. Case, the America Online chairman.

It's a close call. **********Nine West's accounting problem became public on Tuesday, when the company disclosed in a paragraph buried deep in a routine annual filing that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its accounting procedures. Specifically, the company said it had learned on May 1 that the commission voted on April 10 to upgrade an informal staff inquiry into a formal investigation, a step that allows the commission staff to issue subpoenas for information. The dispute was vaguely described as relating to ''the company's revenue recognition policies and practices.'' **********Nine West's investor relations problem erupted about the same time -- and is continuing, in the eyes of several institutional investors and securities lawyers. **********An appropriate response for a widely held company traded on the New York Stock Exchange would have been to issue a news release detailing the nature of the dispute and giving the company's spin on the issue, said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at Columbia University. Tucking the news into a buried paragraph of a lengthy routine filing ''looks like an attempt to bury a needle in a haystack,'' he said. ''If this is a modest dispute over some gray accounting principle, they have certainly blown it up into a far more serious issue by the way they have reacted,'' he added. **********An institutional investor who owns Nine West shares said he thought the company had simply misjudged the importance of the news. ''The company was not overly sensitive to what makes investors jump around,'' he said. ''They were probably shocked at the reaction.'' **********Robert C. Galvin, the company's chief financial officer, would say only that the timing and nature of the disclosure were  made ''on the advice of counsel'' and that he felt it had been completely appropriate, despite the result. **********And the result was a doozy -- especially for the many investors who lack split-second access to corporate documents filed with Federal regulators. **********The company, whose brands of shoes include Nine West, Amalfi, Bandolino, Enzo Angiolini and Easy Spirit, filed an amended annual report citing the investigation with the S.E.C. about 2:30 P.M. on Tuesday. The news was first reported on Federal Filings, a wire service for professional investors, at 2:49 P.M., but other major news services were slower off the mark. **********''As soon as we saw the headline on the Dow wire at 3:18 P.M., we tried to reach the company,'' a New York Stock Exchange spokesman said. After asking if further news would be issued, the Big Board halted trading at 3:51 P.M. Until then, it was likely that many of those who bought the hundreds of thousands of shares that were traded did not know what the sellers knew. The stock last traded at $32.50, down $6.125 from the last trade before the news got out. **********The Big Board was in ''continuing discussions'' with Nine West on Tuesday night and into yesterday morning about ''whether there would be further disclosure,'' the spokesman said. The ''culmination of those discussions'' was a news release at midmorning, after which trading resumed at 1:08 P.M.. yesterday. The company's shares closed at $34.125 each, up $1.625. **********The news release by Nine West gave a bit more information about the S.E.C.'s concerns, which it said focused on accounting methods used by divisions it acquired when it bought the footwear operations of the U.S. Shoe Corporation in May 1995. In addition, Mr. Galvin held a conference call with Wall Street professionals, and offered another tidbit: The dispute concerned the recognition of revenue from wholesale distribution and covered only sales after the acquisition and before the end of Nine West's 1996 fiscal year on Feb. 1, 1996. **********But ''on advice of counsel,'' he did not say very much more about the dispute, other than to insist that it would not be financially important to the company. **********Thus, much remains vague as trading opens today. **********What does the S.E.C. think might be wrong with the way the company measured its revenue? Mr. Galvin would not say, either in the conference call or a later interview, and S.E.C. officials declined to comment as a matter of policy. **********There is one aspect of wholesale distribution that might give rise to serious accounting disputes. The company puts revenue on its books when it ships shoes to wholesale customers, those who resell the shoes through noncompany outlets like department stores. It makes allowances for estimated returns and discounts that it may have to give the stores for slow-moving styles. A lawyer familiar with S.E.C. operations noted that some companies had increased reported revenues by making confidential side deals with customers that reduced or removed the customers' risks. **********The company said it did not know why the informal inquiry by the S.E.C. staff, which began last fall, escalated to a formal investigation.  A formal investigation gives the S.E.C. subpoena power, and companies will often do everything they can to cooperate to avoid having subpoenas issued, particularly to customers. Mr. Galvin said the company was cooperating with the commission, but would not say whether the S.E.C. staff agreed. He said he did not know of any subpoenas that had been issued. **********Why did the company wait until Tuesday to disclose something it learned last Thursday? The company said it took time to consult with its lawyers. **********If the accounting was faulty, how much did it affect earnings? That answer will remain unavailable until more information is released."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/29/business/new-ad-themes-come-with-tumult-in-market.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-10-29", "snippet": "Financial services advertisers are reassessing their sales pitches after stock market's wild swings; some are changing how they talk to customers and potential customers, while others are sticking with their campaigns (M)", "word_count": 555, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Ad Themes Come With Tumult in Market", "print_headline": "New Ad Themes Come With Tumult in Market", "body_text": " **********There has been frenzied activity in the last two days at the intersection of Wall Street and Madison Avenue as financial services advertisers reassess their sales pitches after the stock market's wild swings.

That's the question everyone seems to be asking. My answer is, \"I don't know, and you shouldn't care.\" **********The prices of stocks, in concert or individually, bounce up and down in the short run, but in the long run they produce annual returns of 8 percent in real terms, or about 11 percent with today's inflation. **********In fact, stocks are such a great deal that, for years, economists have been trying to explain something they call the \"equity premium puzzle.\" In plain English, they wonder why it is that stocks return so much, compared with investments like Treasury bills. **********The best explanation seems to be that investors are extremely \u2014 indeed, irrationally \u2014 risk-averse. A century of history shows that if you can hold onto your stocks for at least 10 years, even in the face of some big price drops, you'll end up making very good money. But many investors can't stand that kind of volatility, so, in economic terms, they demand higher returns to compensate. **********Risk aversion is simply a fact, and when it comes to stocks, nearly everyone is scared. And that fear causes investors to do some stupid things, such as selling a perfectly good stock because it has dropped. For that reason, it's vital to invest in a way that protects you from yourself. **********In simple terms, this means a less risky portfolio \u2014 one that's not so susceptible to the extremes of the market's ups and (especially) downs. You can buy bonds or money-market funds, of course, but then you'll sacrifice profits. What's surprising is that there's a way to lower risk while raising your returns. **********The answer is a carefully balanced combination of foreign and U.S. stocks. \"Diversifying Overseas,\" an excellent new publication from T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore-based mutual-fund house (1-800-638-5660), explains the phenomenon by examining returns and risk of international equities over the past 20 years. **********A portfolio consisting of only U.S. stocks \"had an average annualized return of about 14.5% . . . and a standard deviation of 14, meaning that two-thirds of the time, the annual return was within a range of 0% to 28%.\" **********But as more foreign stocks were added to the mix, \"the portfolio's returns increased, but the degree or volatility, or risk, actually declined.\" **********Return up, risk down! You can't beat that combination. But it doesn't last forever. If you keep adding foreign stocks to your portfolio, return will rise, but so will risk. Price researchers found that the optimal risk/reward allocation \"was about 30% foreign and 70% U.S. stocks.\" **********That ideal ratio produced a 14.75 percent return at a standard deviation of 12.95. A portfolio that's 60 percent foreign and 40 percent American had the same deviation as an all-American portfolio but returned nearly 15 percent. A portfolio that's 100 percent foreign had a return of 15.25 percent but with a very high standard deviation of 18. **********As you can see, foreign stocks by themselves are riskier than U.S. stocks. So why does overall risk decline when you add riskier foreign stocks to your U.S. holdings? Because the two kinds of stocks don't move in tandem. When American stocks fall sharply in a year, foreign stocks may rise, or at least not fall so much, so they provide ballast for your portfolio. **********Let's look at the last four years, during which foreign stocks have been underperforming domestic. A 70-30 mix of U.S.-foreign stocks produced an average annual return of 17.0 percent vs. 17.8 percent for an all-U.S. portfolio. But the 70-30 mix was less risky. Its annual returns went from a low of 3 percent to a high of 30 percent, compared to range of 1 percent to 37 percent for the all-U.S. portfolio. **********Will foreign stocks continue to lag, especially with the U.S. economy so far ahead of those in Europe and Japan? Don't count on it. In fact, with unemployment high (11.3 percent for Germany) and growth low (0.8 percent for France), many countries may be hitting bottom, their stocks ripe for purchase. **********Get diversified into foreign stocks.

She drafted news releases, clipped newspaper articles and helped with community relations programs. **********Her big project, the one that will be front and center on her resume, was a 75-page media guide for the coming season, which  she helped finish over Labor Day weekend. **********Ms. Wagner, one of five interns, took home plenty of souvenirs from the team -- T-shirts, bumper stickers, key chains and watches -- but not a penny, not even gas money for all the errands she ran. **********She was an unpaid intern, one of thousands of students working for nothing but experience and, sometimes, for college credit. **********''They treated me well while I was there, but I just think the whole idea of unpaid internships isn't fair,'' Ms. Wagner said. ''At times I just got so frustrated thinking how many hours I put in for free.'' **********Internship experts estimate that 50 to 60 percent of all student internships are unpaid. The figure is closer to 100 percent in glamorous fields like entertainment and politics, they say. **********To be sure, there are plenty of paid internships, some of them with bigger paychecks than the students' parents earn. **********Intel, the chip maker, pays undergraduates $450 to $750 a week and provides moving expenses, discounted housing and a free rental car, according to ''America's Top Internships'' and ''The Internship Bible,'' sister guides that are part of the Princeton Review series by Random House. **********Interns at General Motors earn $450 to $600 a week and receive health insurance, paid vacation days and round-trip travel, according to ''The Internship Bible.'' **********BUT internship listings often show no compensation. And the programs  aren't all offered by struggling nonprofit organizations or small businesses. The Princeton books and ''The Yale Daily News Guide to Internships'' list unpaid internships for well-known businesses like Barney's New York, Merrill Lynch and NBC. **********Although internships seem largely unregulated, there is a law governing the programs. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established minimum wage and overtime protections for workers, lists six criteria employers must meet for interns to be considered trainees and thus not guaranteed the minimum wage. Even internships that offer academic credit must comply. **********Labor lawyers zero in on two stipulations:  the intern cannot displace a regular employee and the company must derive no immediate advantage from the student's work. **********''The bottom line here is whether the activities primarily benefit the individual or the employer,'' said a spokesman for the  Labor Department. **********Ms. Wagner's internship experience was not uncommon, and neither was that of Kerrie Brown, a St. Bonaventure University student, two years ago. Ms. Brown, now a senior, worked for a small cable television station in Maryland. She wanted to get a taste of broadcast journalism and was told she would learn about news writing, production and more. All she did was answer phones and watch television for commercials the station produced. **********''They had me doing secretarial work that they should have been paying someone else to do,'' she said, adding that she quit when a paid internship opened up at a local newspaper. **********So how do so many businesses and organizations continue diving into a gigantic pool of free labor year after year? **********College career counselors and others say various factors are at play. First, the law is not aggressively enforced and is somewhat ambiguous. Second, there is no shortage of applicants for unpaid positions, especially in glamorous fields. **********And both the interns and the businesses seem to enjoy, or at least tolerate, the benefits of the system enough to not rock the boat. Interns can gain invaluable training and good credentials, and there is not much of an incentive for blowing the whistle; the businesses gain free labor and a first peek at workers who are about to graduate. **********''In the 12 years I've been in the field I've never heard of a case where an employer has been even chastised for abusing that law,'' said Dawn Pettit, executive director of the Cooperative Education Association, an organization in Columbia, Md., that promotes work-classroom programs. **********A Pittsburgh labor lawyer, Donald O'Connor, said there had been some cases, including one nearly three years ago in which a public relations agency reached a settlement over billing of clients for the unpaid work of interns. The firm agreed to pay more than $30,000 in back pay to a group of former interns and to pay future interns. **********The Labor Department says there have not been many violations, but concedes that it typically does not investigate a company unless there are complaints. **********''It's not like we have an enforcement program focused on interns,'' the Labor Department spokesman said. **********Ms. Pettit said she would be concerned if a student's unpaid work contributed to big profits. **********''When the student is going there and they're part of a team working on a project ultimately resulting in millions of dollars of income -- some software program, for example -- then, no, it's not fair if she's the only one not being paid,'' she said. **********Unpaid internships, however, may be seen as a rite of corporate passage. As Samer Hamadeh, 28, co-author of ''The Internship Bible'' and ''America's Top Internships'' says, ''This is the way you break into the work world in America.'' **********The numbers bear that out. Some internships attract a flood of applicants. ''America's Top Internships,'' for example, says the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' gets about 750 applicants for 30 unpaid positions,  even though they rate high on the guide's busy-work meter -- running lots of errands, making copies and answering phones. Penguin Books gets about 200 applications for eight unpaid positions in editorial, marketing, sales and other departments, while 250 applicants vie for one summer internship at Elite Model Management in Beverly Hills, Calif., the Yale guide said. **********Mr. Hamadeh, whose internships included a paid stint pumping airplane grease through pipes for Chevron, now hires interns and pays them. But he said there were additional costs for a company. **********''You have to spend a lot more time training them,'' he said. ''They're often much younger and have no office skills.'' **********The companies would ''never hire any of these people otherwise,'' he added. **********INCREASINGLY, said Jack Tinker, director of career services for Connecticut College in New London, Conn., potential employers want -- and schools require -- work experience. And that encourages the current system, with would-be interns unwilling to demand pay. **********Mr. Hamadeh, quoting figures from the National Society of Experiential Education, said that as recently as 1981, just one in 36 college graduates had done an internship.  Ten years later, the figure jumped to one in three. Mr. Hamadeh said that more recent surveys put the figure at about two out of three. **********Supporters of unpaid internships say the benefits outweigh the short-term sacrifices. **********''Our students are coming out with contacts, they're coming out with confidence, they're coming out with stronger resumes,'' said Laura McKaie, assistant dean of career education at the Long Island University Brooklyn campus, where the median age is 26 and many students support families. **********Internships are especially crucial in industries where contacts are the only way in the door. Steve Cook, a 1997 graduate of Northwestern University's film school, said the Hollywood jobs in which he was interested were not advertised, so it was essential to have a network of people to call regularly. **********Mr. Cook, who just directed his first film, ''The Choir Invisible,'' started internships as soon as he graduated from the Lawrenceville School near Princeton, N.J. He spent his college summers in California, working without pay for companies including Hollywood Pictures, NBC, the Gersh Agency and Prufrock Pictures, the actress Meg Ryan's production company. **********Despite her frustrations and empty bank account, Ms. Wagner said she would do her  internship with the sports team all over again. She sought the job and volunteered to do the media guide, for which the team was prepared to hire a graphics artist. **********''I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to try something big like that,'' she said. Ms. Wagner lived with her parents, who took care of her bills."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/08/world/fbi-inquiry-is-israel-using-mole-in-us.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1997-05-08", "snippet": "United States says Federal Bureau of Investigation probes intercepted conversation between Israeli intelligence officer in Washington and superior in Israel that suggests Israel has intelligence source that can obtain confidential American diploma...", "word_count": 733, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F.B.I.

One official suggested that the F.B.I. has identified no suspect in the case. **********Israeli officials today flatly denied allegations that they are engaged in espionage in the United States or that Israel has a mole in the American Government handing over documents. **********''Israel does not indulge in any kind of illegal action in information gathering in the United States,'' said David Bar-Illan, the chief spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. **********The existence of the intercept was first disclosed by a report today in The Washington Post, which described the intercept of a conversation between an Israeli intelligence officer in Washington and his superior in Tel Aviv. **********Quoting ''sources with direct knowledge of the inquiry,'' The Post said the Washington-based Israeli wanted guidance on whether he should go to ''Mega'' for a copy of a letter written by Warren M. Christopher, then Secretary of State, to the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. **********According to The Post, the Washington-based Israeli said in Hebrew that ''the Ambassador wants me to go to Mega to get a copy of this letter.'' The supervisor in Tel Aviv reportedly said: ''This is not something we use Mega for.'' **********An American Government official today confirmed that the F.B.I. is investigating the intercept ''and what it means.'' Among the many possibilities under investigation, officials said, are whether Mega refers to an American citizen or someone from a third country. **********One Israeli official acknowledged  that in mid-January ''a lot of people wanted this letter,'' which was published two weeks later in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz. But this official said that ''to jump to the conclusion that there is an American official manipulated by Israel or paid by them is a jump too far.'' **********The official confirmed that Israeli officials often used code names in trans-Atlantic conversations and said: ''Maybe that's not the exact code name. Maybe it's not a person, but a code name for an organization or a method.'' **********American officials said they would have no official comment on the report. After the usual consultation among agencies, a State Department spokesman, John Dinger, said: ''We don't comment as a matter of policy on alleged intelligence matters.'' **********The Israeli Ambassador here, Eliahu Ben Elissar, also denied the allegations of spying in vehement terms. ''The story is absolutely baseless,'' he said. ''Israel is not involved in any kind of espionage or trying to obtain intelligence from the United States. We work only in diplomatic channels in the framework of friendly relations with the United States.'' **********And in Jerusalem, a senior official in Mr. Netanyahu's office said: ''Israel does not use intelligence agents in the U.S. Period.'' **********Still, senior Western diplomats expressed skepticism about the blanket Israeli denial of espionage here, and one American official who did not want to be identified pointed to the case of Jonathan Pollard. Mr. Pollard, an American who was working as a civilian intelligence analyst for the Navy, was arrested in 1985 and pleaded guilty in 1986 to spying for Israel and remains in prison serving a life sentence. **********Israeli officials insisted then that Mr. Pollard had been recruited in an operation run outside normal, authorized channels by Rafael Eitan, who worked for the Defense Ministry and the Prime Minister's Office. **********But the Pollard case did great damage to relations between the United States and Israel, one Israeli official said, He noted that there has been no formal accusation since of Israel spying against the United States. **********The letter in question was a set of assurances given to Mr. Arafat by Mr. Christopher on Jan. 16 and represented part of the accords reached with American mediation about the withdrawal of Israeli troops from most of the West Bank city of Hebron. A parallel letter to the Israelis was made public by Mr. Netanyahu, but Mr. Arafat did not do the same. The letter assured the Palestinians that Israeli commitments to them were viewed by the Americans as commitments to them, as well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/02/business/luther-simjian-is-dead-at-92-held-more-than-200-patents.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1997-11-02", "snippet": "Luther G Simjian, inventor, dies at age 92; photo (M)", "word_count": 774, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Luther Simjian Is Dead at 92; Held More Than 200 Patents", "print_headline": "Luther Simjian Is Dead at 92; Held More Than 200 Patents", "body_text": " **********Luther G. Simjian, a prolific inventor who held patents on devices as diverse as the flight simulator, the self-focusing camera, the automated teller machine and the Teleprompter, died at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Oct. 23. He was 92. **********During an inventing career that spanned seven decades, Mr. Simjian, a Turk who immigrated to the United States at the age of 16, held more than 200 domestic and international patents, most in electronics and optics. **********''Many called him the second Thomas A. Edison,'' said Richard G. Snyder, president of Reflectone Inc., a company in Tampa, Fla., that Mr. Simjian founded in 1939. **********Initially educated in the Middle East and France, Mr. Simjian finished his secondary education in New Haven, where he lived with an uncle. **********Taken with the idea of studying medicine, Mr. Simjian, after finishing high school, began to work in the photographic laboratory at the Yale University Medical School. **********But he proved so deft with a camera that thoughts of studying medicine were set aside, and in 1928 Mr. Simjian was named the first director of a newly created photography department at the Yale Medical School. **********While at Yale, Mr. Simjian patented several new devices, including the self-focusing camera in 1932 and a color X-ray machine in 1934. **********In 1939, he founded Reflectone, which was initially based in Stamford, Conn., to develop and manufacture his inventions. **********Disturbed by the deaths of many contemporaries and friends during World War II, Mr. Simjian invented the Optical Range Estimation Trainer, the first flight simulator of its kind, to train pilots and tail gunners. **********In the early 1960's, Reflectone was merged with the Universal Match Company. Later, it was spun off as an independent, public company and earlier this year was sold for about $90 million to the British Aerospace Company. It remains in the business of making full-flight simulators for commercial and military aircraft. **********Mr. Simjian subsequently formed two other companies, General Research Inc. and Command Automation Inc. as umbrella organizations for his increasingly eclectic list of inventions. **********Over the years, those included a supersonic exploring device for the ultrasound procedures used in hospitals, a method for tenderizing meat and a remote controlled postage meter. **********''One thing I discovered about myself in the early days of my life is that I can't stick with just one idea for too long,'' Mr. Simjian wrote in a autobiography that was privately published earlier this year. **********In the 1960's, he received more than 20 patents on ideas that form the basis of automated banking, from the notion of creating a machine that could accept deposits and dispense cash at any hour. **********In his autobiography, Mr. Simjian said he had doubts about whether  bank customers would place their faith in a machine to take their money ''with no proof of what they had put in other than a printed receipt.'' **********Indeed, a precursor of what is now Citicorp took a few of Mr. Simjian's machines on a trial basis, but after about six months the bank, which later became the first big user of such machines, told him they had only limited appeal, according to Mr. Simjian's autobiography. **********''It seems the only people who were using the machines were a small number of prostitutes and gamblers who didn't want to deal with tellers face to face,'' Mr. Simjian wrote. ''And the bank said there were not enough of them to make the deal lucrative.'' **********A golfer, Mr. Simjian developed and patented a computerized indoor golf practice range during the 1960's. When a ball is struck, an analog computer calculates and projects its flight on a screen. In 1973, he created an exercise bike that massages the torso while the rider pedals. **********''He once sent me a swivel chair he invented that allowed you to sit at a dressing table and look at your hair from four different angles,'' said Bobbie Kay Stafford, an associate at the New York brokerage firm of Melhado, Flynn & Associates. She was Mr. Simjian's stockbroker for the last 16 years of his life. **********Indeed, despite failing eyesight, Mr. Simjian kept on inventing until his death. In March, he received his last patent, for a process designed to improve the resonance of wood used in making musical instruments. **********In 1978, in recognition of his work,  Mr. Simjian received the Eli Whitney Award by the Connecticut Patent Law Association. **********He is survived by his wife, the former Gladys Cannon, of Fort Lauderdale; a daughter, Maryjo S. Garre of Barrington, Ill., and three grandchildren."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/09/business/company-news-renex-raises-24-million-in-initial-offering-of-stock.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-10-09", "snippet": "Renex Corp sells three million shares for $24 million, or $8 each, in initial public offering (S)", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RENEX RAISES $24 MILLION IN INITIAL OFFERING OF STOCK", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; RENEX RAISES $24 MILLION IN INITIAL OFFERING OF STOCK", "body_text": " **********The Renex Corporation said yesterday that it had sold three million shares for $24 million, or $8 each, in an initial public offering.

M. Rothschild of London and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company counseled British Telecom when the first proposal was made earlier this year. **********Then Salomon Brothers appeared as adviser to Worldcom, when that upstart telecommunications company stunned the business world with its $30 billion all-stock bid on Oct. 1. MCI added Lehman Brothers as an adviser alongside Lazard. And now Goldman, Sachs & Company and the Bear Stearns Companies have appeared as advisers for GTE, MCI's latest suitor. **********Merrill Lynch & Company, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, and Credit Suisse First Boston, which have all spent millions of dollars building big telecommunications banking practices in recent years, are perhaps the few well-known Wall Street names in the telecommunications investment banking business not yet to be involved in this deal. Indeed, so many firms are involved that many of the industry's best analysts can no longer speak publicly about the deal because their firms are working on it. **********Don't spare too much thought for these or the other banks and financial advisers building telecommunications practices, though. There is quite enough business to go around as this industry, already with estimated worldwide revenues of $700 billion and $1 trillion of market capitalization, sets about exploiting new technologies and servicing new customers. **********Merrill, for example, is just completing a $7 billion offering of shares for France Telecom, and is also involved in privatizing telecommunications businesses in Portugal, Hungary, India and Italy. It now has 70 telecommunications bankers, up from just 15 four years ago, according to Thomas S. Middleton, a managing director and co-head of the firm's global telecommunications investment banking. **********The battle for MCI is affecting just about all the Wall Street bankers who specialize in telecommunications as well -- whether they're directly involved in the transaction or not. **********''All of us are scrambling to stay up with the events unfolding here, and the way big companies are thinking about their businesses,'' said Colin R. Knudsen, a managing director at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''If you'd asked me six months ago whether there was a chance of a bidding war for MCI, I would have said not a chance. This will change everything in the telecommunications industry.'' **********Big law firms are making out handsomely in the maneuvering for MCI, too. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett is advising MCI, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore counsels Worldcom, and Shearman & Sterling represents British Telecom. O'Melveny & Myers and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson are said to be working with GTE, according to people involved in the bids. **********Yet more law firms and investment banks may soon join in the jostling around MCI. The current guessing game on Wall Street is what other players may enter the game next. **********''In the light of what is going on, what is AT&T doing? The Baby Bells, how long can they sit on the sidelines?'' said one senior telecommunications investment banker yesterday, who spoke on condition of anonymity. **********The prize for the investment bankers who actually do a deal as large as this one is considerable: a likely fee of more than $30 million for the acquirer's advising bank or banks, and a sum of several millions for MCI's financial advisers. But even those firms involved with the also-rans will pick up valuable scraps -- a few million dollars in fees. **********If and when an agreement to sell MCI is struck, there will be a huge amount of follow-up business for Wall Street, as well as for the big commercial banks, such as Chase Manhattan, Nationsbank, Citicorp, J. P. Morgan and BankAmerica that specialize in financing telecommunications, bankers said yesterday. There would, for instance, be asset sales and restructuring as the new merged company sorted out its combined operations. **********The activity in the telecommunications banking business has been good for Wall Street's headhunters, who said yesterday that only the growth of health care investment banking has come close to matching it in recent years. **********''It's obvious that telecommunications people who know about the industry are going for premiums on Wall Street,'' said Dirk A. Himes, a vice president at A. T. Kearney, an international executive search firm based in Chicago. **********''There has been more recruiting in telecommunications,'' said his colleague, Joseph C. Haberman, in the firm's New York office. The surge is ''between them and health care and gaming, the emerging growth sectors of the economy where there is a lot of capital-raising.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/07/world/in-zaire-a-signal-that-mobutu-may-depart-today.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1997-05-07", "snippet": "Pres Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire will make state visit to Gabon, a trip is widely seen as way for him to escape before rebels capture his capital, Kinshasa; diplomats from United States, South Africa and other nations have been working in last few d...", "word_count": 1171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Zaire, a Signal That Mobutu May Depart Today", "print_headline": "In Zaire, a Signal That Mobutu May Depart Today", "body_text": " **********With rebel forces pressing ahead in a campaign to capture this city, state television announced this evening that President Mobutu Sese Seko would leave the country on Wednesday for a three-day visit to nearby Gabon -- a trip that is widely seen here as a way for him to escape before his capital falls. **********The announcement came a day after the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, threatened to hunt down Mr. Mobutu and his closest supporters in the streets if the President did not resign. **********The official explanation for the trip is a meeting of French-speaking regional leaders to discuss the crisis that is gripping Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire. Officials were quick to insist that the President would return afterward. ''It is almost certain that Mr. Mobutu will leave tomorrow,'' said a senior Presidential aide. ''He will return by all means from Gabon on Friday.'' **********But another member of the Presidential entourage, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, ''We all expect that after Gabon he will go to the hospital somewhere for treatment.'' Mr. Mobutu, 66, is suffering from prostate cancer, and spent several months in France for treatment over the last year. **********Diplomats from the United States, South Africa and other countries have been working steadily in the last few days to ease Mr. Mobutu out of power and avoid a violent takeover of this crowded city of five million by the rebel forces. **********If Mr. Mobutu departs on Wednesday as planned, he will be able to leave his country on official business, as head of state, rather than surrendering to Mr. Kabila or simply resigning, something he has vowed never to do. **********With Mr. Mobutu gone, diplomats here say there would be far less chance that the Special Presidential Division, a loyalist guard drawn from Mr. Mobutu's own northern Ngbandi tribe and related ethnic groups, would mount a last-ditch battle to defend the city from capture. **********Tension has risen steadily in this city in recent days along with expectations of an imminent rebel arrival. Kinshasa has already been heavily looted twice this decade by Government soldiers, and many fear a repetition of the destruction if soldiers here were to panic. **********Unconfirmed reports from rebel sources said that Government soldiers pillaged Gbadolite, Mr. Mobutu's hometown and site of his principal palace, today. Mr. Kabila's forces recently took Mr. Mobutu's birthplace, Lisala, and were believed to be advancing on Gbadolite, both in Zaire's far north. **********According to diplomats and travelers arriving in Kinshasa from the south of the city, Mr. Kabila's rebels are already present in limited numbers on Kinshasa's southern outskirts, and the rebels are reported to be preparing a much larger buildup in the city of Kikwit, some 240 miles to the east. **********A Western diplomat here said he expected that once Mr. Mobutu left, the rebels would make a quick thrust to capture Kinshasa's international airport, 16 miles east of the city. Mr. Kabila has already identified the airport as a target. **********If the airport is captured, the rebel forces can begin flying troops to Kinshasa in large numbers from bases in the country's south, and from neighboring Angola, which has become Mr. Kabila's biggest backer in recent weeks. **********In a move that was interpreted by many as an effort to calm rumors of the rebels' arrival here, Mr. Mobutu's military Government announced today that it had recaptured Kikwit, and killed 500 of Mr. Kabila's men in fierce fighting. Diplomats and regional military analysts dismissed those reports. **********Government officials also reported fighting at Kenge, a rebel forward base 140 miles to the east of Kinshasa. The diplomats and analysts said, however, that the skirmishes at Kenge were likely to have involved Angolan forces from that country's Unita rebel movement hired by Mr. Mobutu to slow the rebels' advance on Kinshasa. **********The military analysts said that far from falling back into Government hands, Kikwit has become a major staging area for the rebels, who are said to be flying troops to the city of 250,000 in large numbers from Lubumbashi, in the south, and from Angola. **********''What you've had in the last couple of days is basically every kind of aircraft imaginable flying rebel troops into Kikwit,'' said a regional military analyst. ''Once Kenge is secured, they'll start flying smaller planes in there, and from there, Kinshasa is just a short hop away.'' **********At Mr. Mobutu's palace here, located in a normally tranquil military garrison known as Camp Tshatshi, the busy movement of soldiers suggested that, for the President's guard, the front lines in Zaire's war had receded all the way to the camp's entrance gates. **********Within the gates, trucks ferried soldiers and rocket launchers back and forth in front of a huge billboard painted with a portrait of Mr. Mobutu that read, ''Welcome Back Papa Marshal.'' Jittery soldiers chased away a journalist who tried for a few moments to inquire about Mr. Mobutu's family. **********For most residents of the capital today, however, life went on as normal, despite reports of the rebels' continued advance. Most of the population here seems to be eagerly awaiting Mr. Kabila's arrival, still seeing him as a liberator after more than three decades of ruinous rule by Mr. Mobutu. **********''After 32 years under one man we are saturated,'' said Jocelyn Kimbombo, a 27-year-old seamstress. ''We don't know exactly what Kabila will do for us, but we all hope that he will think about his country more than Mobutu did.'' **********Mr. Kabila's international reputation has continued to deteriorate, even as people prepare to welcome him here. **********Mr. Kabila's movement, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, was created with the help of Rwanda six months ago during an uprising in eastern Zaire by ethnic Tutsi there. **********Relief officials say that throughout the alliance's campaign for power in Zaire it has simultaneously waged a merciless war against the large population of Hutu refugees in Zaire, many of whom took part in the 1994 massacres of the Tutsi minority in Rwanda. **********In recent weeks the rebellion's treatment of Rwandan Hutu refugees has come under attack by foreign diplomats, United Nations relief agencies and other aid groups in Zaire. There have been reports and some direct evidence that rebel forces had a hand in killing refugees as well as in blocking relief efforts and attempts to return refugees to Rwanda. **********Emma Bonino, the European Union's commissioner for humanitarian affairs, said Mr. Kabila had turned eastern Zaire into ''a slaughterhouse,'' and publicly questioned whether the rebel leader would be an improvement over Mr. Mobutu's dictatorship. **********In recent days, international human rights investigators have said that Mr. Kabila's forces have denied them access to areas in eastern Zaire where there have been persistent reports of massacres by the rebels. **********At the same time, relief workers in the northeastern city of Kisangani have complained that rebel forces have impeded work intended to save tens of thousands of Hutu from disease and starvation after their camps were attacked by rebels and local villagers recently. **********''I don't even think that when you are dealing with cattle you treat cattle like that,'' Juan Carlos Brandt, a United Nations spokesman, said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/22/business/kimberly-clark-to-dismiss-5000-workers-and-eliminate-18-plants.html": {"writer_name": "Dana Canedy", "pub_date": "1997-11-22", "snippet": "Kimberly-Clark Corp, whose paper products such as Kleenex tissue and Scott paper goods face pricing pressure and stiffer competition, particularly in Europe, announces it will dismiss about 5,000 workers and sell or close as many as 18 plants; com...", "word_count": 694, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kimberly-Clark to Dismiss 5,000 Workers and Eliminate 18 Plants", "print_headline": "Kimberly-Clark to Dismiss 5,000 Workers and Eliminate 18 Plants", "body_text": " **********The Kimberly-Clark Corporation said yesterday that it would dismiss 7 percent of its employees, or about 5,000 workers, and sell or close as many as 18 plants. The cuts, which will start immediately, come as  company products like Kleenex tissue and Scott paper goods are facing pricing pressure and stiffer competition. **********As a result of the cuts, the company, which also makes Huggies diapers and Kotex feminine products, will take a fourth-quarter charge of $590 million, or $1.06 a share. The company said the plan would save $200 million a year by 2000. It  described the cuts as worldwide but as for specific location would say only that 60 percent would occur in North America. **********''By consolidating facilities, we will eliminate excess, high-cost production capacity and narrow our focus to advanced technologies,'' said Wayne R. Sanders, the chairman of the company. ''We also are setting the stage for the next generation of supply chain savings, which will enable us to further streamline the way we distribute our products and provide additional funds to invest in the growth of our global brands.'' **********Kimberly-Clark, a $13 billion company based in Dallas, announced the cuts after the stock market closed. Earlier, its shares rose $1.875, to $53.75. **********Many of Kimberly-Clark's problems stem from too much capacity in its tissue business, aggressive competition, particularly in Europe, and pressure to keep prices low. The pricing issue alone will reduce operating profit by about $250 million this year. **********''The company kind of hit a pothole this year,'' said Kathryn McAuley, an analyst who follows the company for Brown Brothers Harriman. ''Their markets have been very difficult. This is an environment where you have very low inflation and it is very difficult to raise product prices, so one has to focus more on the bottom line, on the cost structure. That is what happens when prices are somewhat stagnant.'' **********Yet, since the problems are largely attributed to difficulties in the tissue business, one question is how much of the company's troubles can be attributed to its acquisition in 1995 of the Scott Paper Company, which had just undergone major surgery led by Albert J. Dunlap, a turnaround expert who has been called Chainsaw Al for the way he downsizes companies. **********Revamping of Kimberly-Clark tissue operations will account for 70 percent of the charge. And at least two of the plants scheduled for sale or closing are former Scott tissue mills, one in Winslow, Me., and the other in Marinette, Wis. **********Kimberly-Clark, which would not identify the other plants that are on the block, insisted that the announcement yesterday was not a reflection that in buying Scott it had purchased a company that was still ailing. **********''The Scott merger has been beneficial; we are achieving the expected synergies,'' said Tina Barry, a company spokeswoman. ''Our gross margins and our operating profit margins are 3 to 4 percentage points higher than pre-merger levels.'' **********The company said the cutbacks would eliminate excess production capacity, including more than 200,000 metric tons of high-cost tissue manufacturing capacity. The excess tissue capacity results from improvements in productivity and technology since the merger that the company says caused it to produce more products that it could sell. **********Even so, consolidating the companies seems to have been a tougher job than Kimberly-Clark had expected. **********''Kimberly knew the Scott facilities were older and that Dunlap had been there for a short period of time and some of the changes he made were somewhat cosmetic,'' Ms. McAuley said. ''What Kimberly had hoped was that the market would grow. The market didn't grow and that highlighted the problem with Scott.'' Nonetheless, Ms. McAuley said, the Scott acquisition was a good investment. **********Mr. Dunlap, now chairman of the Sunbeam Corporation, said yesterday that Scott, which had been losing money for years before he took it over, was a healthy company by the time Kimberly-Clark bought it. He also said the cuts announced yesterday were not surprising. **********''It says zero about the health of Scott at the time they acquired it,'' Mr. Dunlap said. ''Even if you put together two of the most efficient companies in the world, you're still going to have consolidation, just like you do in the aerospace industry or the banking industry.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/16/business/worldbusiness/IHT-brussels-demands-more-concessions-euboeing-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Barry James", "pub_date": "1997-07-16", "snippet": "Antitrust talks between Boeing Co. and the European Commission stalled Tuesday, with no sign of a breakthrough that could avert a serious trade dispute between the United States and the European Union..The commission said late Tuesday that Boeing ...", "word_count": 3502, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brussels Demands More Concessions : EU-Boeing Talks Stall As Trade Fight Looms", "print_headline": "Brussels Demands More Concessions : EU-Boeing Talks Stall As Trade Fight Looms", "body_text": " **********Antitrust talks between Boeing Co. and the European Commission stalled Tuesday, with no sign of a breakthrough that could avert a serious trade dispute between the United States and the European Union. **********The commission said late Tuesday that Boeing had failed to address its concerns regarding the proposed acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. and that it fully backed the tough stance taken by its antitrust chief, Karel Van Miert. **********\"Boeing has so far not agreed to measures which would meet these concerns,\" the EU's executive agency, said.

A contemporary British writer who taught at Oxford University for many years, David Selbourne, said he had discovered the work in Italy and then had translated and edited it. **********A front-page article about the book appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 21. But recently there has been talk among scholars that it might be a hoax. Jonathan Spence, a specialist in Chinese history at Yale University, said yesterday that descriptions of sexual practices, street life and other elements led him to doubt the book's genuineness. A review by Mr. Spence was scheduled to appear in The New York Times Book Review on Oct. 12 but has been suspended. **********''We had sent copies of galleys out to a broad spectrum of academics looking for concerns and enthusiasms,'' said Sarah Crichton, the Little, Brown publisher in New York. ''We also sent it to Jonathan Spence. We heard through reporters last week that he felt it was a fake and would be saying so in The Times.'' **********But she said: ''We are not doing this to sidestep a bad review. Other academics we respect very much are raising concerns.'' **********She said Little, Brown's sister company in England would publish the book in October. **********Mr. Selbourne, reached at his home in Urbino, Italy, vouched for the book, a vivid account of a journey undertaken by d'Ancona in 1270 through China, Syria, the Persian Gulf region and India. **********''Uncreative academics are always distressed when a fellow academic writes something which attracts attention and becomes popular or sells,'' he said. He called the objections ''the product of destructive spite.'' **********Mr. Selbourne, 60, has taught the history of ideas at Ruskin College, Oxford, and is the author of ''The Principle of Duty,'' a 1994  book of political philosophy. **********The manuscript describes in detail the Chinese coastal city of Zaitun. There are dramatic accounts of the city's rulers, criminals and prostitutes. At one point, d'Ancona writes, he took part in a civic debate on whether Zaitun should assemble an army against Mongol invaders. **********Mr. Selbourne said an Italian who lived near Urbino brought him the manuscript in 1991. He said he was allowed to translate and edit it only after pledging not to disclose the owner's identity or to show anyone the original. **********In an interview, Mr. Spence cited aspects of ''The City of Light'' that he said raised questions. **********D'Ancona, for instance, describes the sexual behavior of Chinese women. ''The intimate description of male and female private parts would not be common in a journal of that time, especially from a religious man,'' Mr. Spence said. **********Mr. Spence also doubted that a foreigner could take part in a debate on assembling an army. **********Also. he said, the merchant describes ''the incredible noise of a constant number of carriages.'' But he said: ''This was not an area of carriages. They mostly had sedan chairs and coolies.'' **********Mr. Selbourne said the descriptions of sex were ''somewhat unusual,'' but added, ''Jews don't have a puritanical view of sex.'' **********As for d'Ancona's participation in civic debate, Mr. Selbourne said, ''Jacob may have invested himself with more persona than he may have had.'' In reference to the carriages, he said, ''I may have mistranslated.'' **********Mr. Selbourne said: ''It's either a hoax being passed off on me, or it's a work written by me.  Then it's a great picaresque, philosophical novel, which I would be proud to have written.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/03/business/the-media-business-chief-named-at-corporation-for-public-tv.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-10-03", "snippet": "Robert T Coonrod is named president and chief executive of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (S)", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chief Named at Corporation for Public TV", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Chief Named at Corporation for Public TV", "body_text": " **********Robert T.

In return, they were passed a brass container the size of a suitcase that they were told contained a football-sized nuclear weapon, or so the story goes. **********The container was spirited to the mountain town of Pale, headquarters of Radovan Karadzic and his wartime government. Dr. Karadzic, unable to contain his excitement, pried open the lid and stared inside to see his prize, which the seller, a Liberian arms dealer, said was made with a substance called Red Mercury. **********''It was filled with this jelly-like material,'' said Predrag Ceranic, the head of the secret police at the time, who said he was involved in the operation. ''Mr. Karadzic immediately suspected that he had been cheated. He told everyone in the room that maybe this was just jelly.'' **********Mr. Ceranic has a sheaf of documents to support his story. But his timing in announcing it -- just before the recent Bosnian Serb parliamentary elections -- and his current allegiance to Dr. Karadzic's rival, Biljana Plavsic, suggest that whether the story is true or not the tricks and posturing of modern democratic political campaigning have not eluded the Bosnians. **********Aides to Ms. Plavsic, the Bosnian Serb President, naturally confirmed the tale told by Mr. Ceranic, who broke with Dr. Karadzic this summer and is now the chief of state security for Ms. Plavsic. And officials loyal to Dr. Karadzic, predictably, dismissed it. **********''This is part of the campaign against Dr. Karadzic,'' said Slavko Paleksic, the Minister of Police in Pale, who was reached by telephone. ''Dr. Karadzic is the very personification of our struggle and this is why Plavsic and her supporters keep up these attacks. It seems a shame to accuse a man who is not able to defend himself, who cannot even leave his own home. If this happened in 1995, why do these people decide to tell us about it now?'' **********Perhaps unknown to Dr. Karadzic, the mysterious substance has been the center of several swindles in recent Eastern European history. **********''It was a crazy idea, but Dr. Karadzic is a gambler and he was willing to part with a lot of money, taken from the Serbian people, to realize his dream of getting his hands on a nuclear weapon,'' Mr. Ceranic said. ''He began to speak openly in early 1995 about the arrival of a secret weapon that would end the war, although at the time few people knew he intended to buy a nuclear bomb.'' **********Mr. Ceranic said that in January 1995, Dr. Karadzic made contact with the arms dealer, Nikolas Oman, who said he had contacts with Russians peddling a miniature neutron bomb that weighed less than 5 pounds. The arms dealer promised Mr. Karadzic that 12 hours after detonation there would be no harmful radiation, Mr. Ceranic said. **********''Nikolas told the Defense Minister that Red Mercury looked just like Ping-Pong balls,'' Mr. Ceranic said. **********After the first $6 million in cash, the remaining $60 million would be raised by mortgaging a state-owned oil refinery in Srpski Brod to a Liberian-owned company, Orbal Marketing Service Ltd. **********On March 1, 1995, according to legal documents in Mr. Ceranic's possession, the company gave the Bosnian Serb Government a $60 million mortgage for the refinery. **********Milan Ninkovic, the Bosnian Serb Defense Minister at the time, withdrew $6 million from the central bank in Banja Luka a few weeks later, according to the documents. **********''Once the formalities of the mortgage were complete, arrangements were made for the delivery of Red Mercury,'' Mr. Ceranic said. ''At the end of March, a passenger car arrived at the Gradiska border crossing from the direction of Zagreb. It was met by Ninkovic and an armed escort.'' **********Russian gangsters have been selling ''pure fusion'' Red Mercury weapons in Eastern Europe for more than a decade to clients from rogue states and terrorist groups. Red Mercury samples that have turned up in Europe have proved to be innocuous. Most scientists say that the small nuclear weapons, as well as the substance allegedly used to make them, do not exist. **********That apparently was the case with the Bosnian Serb purchase. **********According to Mr. Ceranic, Dr. Karadzic, in a panic, sent top aides to Moscow to find out more about Red Mercury and what exactly his $6 million had bought. ''When the delegation got back to Pale they reported to Karadzic that he had been swindled,'' Mr. Ceranic said. **********''Mr. Karadzic was disappointed,'' Mr. Ceranic.

In terms of money and manpower, head-to-head comparisons of the Netscape Communications Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation are a misnomer. ''Our nose is firmly pressed against Microsoft's shin,'' one Netscape executive said. **********Until recently, the company that fueled the Internet revolution appeared to be in decline, withering under Microsoft's assault. Netscape's share of the market for Internet browser software was falling and experts predicted further sharp losses to Microsoft. Business magazines from Fortune to Red Herring questioned Netscape's ability to compete, if not survive. In August, the Aberdeen Group, a research firm, published a report with a title that captured the consensus of industry opinion: ''Netscape's Diminishing Role as an Internet Superstar.'' **********But Netscape's star has regained some of its luster lately, prompting a reassessment of the outlook for the company even before Washington's decision last month to enter the browser war. The Justice Department is seeking a court order to stop Microsoft from forcing computer makers that use its Windows operating system to also use its Internet Explorer browsing program. A Federal court will probably not rule on the matter for months, yet the impact of the Justice move, if any, may be to slow Microsoft's advance in the browser market. **********Yet even without Washington's help, Netscape has recently shown more staying power than the industry skeptics thought possible. Last month, for example, Netscape reported strong third-quarter financial results, with both revenues and profits rising 50 percent, silencing worries that the company's growth was stalling. **********''Netscape has held up remarkably well, better than a lot of people expected, myself included,'' said David M. Smith, an Internet software specialist at the Gartner Group, a research firm. **********Still, life is always risky for an upstart leader in a young market that the Microsoft mothership in Redmond, Wash., has determined to rule. Many other companies, to be sure, are up against Microsoft in segments of the Internet software market, including Sun Microsystems, Oracle, I.B.M. and Novell. They are all partners with Netscape in various ways in an informal ''anybody but Microsoft'' camp. But Microsoft's other major competitors are older, bigger and diversified, benefiting from the ballast of other businesses. **********As a pure Internet company, Netscape does not enjoy those advantages. That is why the fast-growing, profitable three-year-old has seen its stock price fall by nearly 40 percent in the last year. ''Microsoft depresses our stock price because we're perceived as being in its cross hairs,'' explained Peter Currie, an executive vice president for Netscape. **********The Grown-Up **********Barksdale Brought Netscape Credibility **********The person principally responsible for charting a course that enables Netscape to survive, even thrive, in the shadow of Microsoft is its president and chief executive, James L. Barksdale. And Mr. Barksdale, by all accounts, deserves much of the credit for Netscape's resilience to date. He has brought strategic direction and management discipline to the young company, according to industry executives and analysts, and he has proved to be a skillful salesman who can persuade button-down corporate America to buy from an Internet pioneer. **********''Barksdale is the guy who adds adult credibility to what would otherwise be a band of techies,'' said Richard Shaffer of Technologic Partners, a research firm. **********In some ways, Mr. Barksdale is an unlikely software executive. At 54, he is twice the age of many of his employees. A Southerner, born and raised in Jackson, Miss., he is laconic of speech, fond of homespun one-liners populated by snakes, dogs, chickens and country porches -- known as Barksdaleisms at Netscape. His is not a personal style familiar to the software business, a hyperkinetic industry where people typically try to win arguments by simply talking faster than anyone else. **********Mr. Barksdale, however, has spent most of his career on the sober side of the software business -- buying it instead of selling it, using it instead of creating it. He is probably best known for his 13 years at the Federal Express Corporation where he rose to become chief operating officer, serving as the principal architect of the computerized tracking and delivery system so critical to the company's success. **********''Jim Barksdale's great strength is in understanding the uses of technology,'' said Frederick W. Smith, the chairman of Federal Express. ''He's not a technologist, but a manager who is technologically literate.'' **********Friends and colleagues describe Mr. Barksdale as a brilliant and charismatic leader. While traveling with Mr. Barksdale recently, L. John Doerr, a leading venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and a director of Netscape, said: ''Fedex drivers would see him on the street, come over and give him a high five. He's inspired great loyalty wherever he has been. He is one of the great business leaders of America.'' **********In a leadership gesture not lost on his team, Mr. Barksdale cut his own salary to $1 this year, explaining that the company could do better things with the money. **********Mr. Barksdale, of course, is also an intense, relentless competitor. To his rivals at Microsoft, the clearest evidence of Mr. Barksdale's no-holds-barred approach is Netscape's legal strategy. He constantly tells his workers that the company must rely only on its success in the marketplace, but Mr. Barksdale has prodded Washington to take antitrust action against Microsoft. **********The Netscape campaign, according to Nathan Myhrvold, chief technology officer of Microsoft, resembles a ''Nixon-era dirty tricks team.'' **********''Don't believe this notion that Barksdale is some gracious Southern gentleman,'' Mr. Myhrvold added. ''That's nonsense.'' **********Mr. Barksdale understandably takes a different view of his company's antitrust appeals. ''Microsoft is a great company,'' he said, ''and it would be even better if it did it legally.'' **********An antitrust ruling against Microsoft could slow it down, but will not stop its march in the Internet market. The Chinese army is indeed coming. Since April 1996, Microsoft's share of the browser market has increased to 36 percent from 4 percent, estimates Zona Research, a market research firm. Over the same span, Netscape's browser share has slipped to 62 percent from 87 percent. **********The Competitor **********Financial Muscle And a Good Browser **********Microsoft brings not only muscle and marketing dollars to the contest, but, increasingly, technical excellence as well. In several product reviews in computer magazines and newspapers, the new version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser has beat out Netscape's Navigator in terms of ease of use and features. **********Mr. Barksdale and the Netscape team say that the browser has been a vehicle to become noticed. But Netscape's business, they say, more and more depends on selling the back-end network software and services to help companies use the Internet as a rich, low-cost communications tool to streamline the way they produce, sell and service products. And for corporate America, the potential Internet productivity payoff lies in creating tighter links with workers, suppliers and consumers. ''An enterprise software company,'' Mr. Barksdale said, ''that's what we want to be.'' **********So if Microsoft's browser share crosses the 50 percent mark in a year or 18 months, as most analysts expect, that is not a problem, Mr. Barksdale insists, as long as Netscape continues to extend its reach in the broader Internet software market. **********The Internet business, Mr. Barksdale says, will not evolve as did the operating- system business -- a winner-take-all market that Microsoft dominates. As long as the software of different companies contains a core of industry standards -- or is ''open,'' in geekspeak -- Netscape, Mr. Barksdale says, should be able to hold its own. **********''Our bet is that the Internet will not be a winner-take-all market and that Netscape will be a big winner in this world,'' he said. **********Mr. Barksdale's confidence rests on his past experience with networks, physical or electronic, at Federal Express and McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., where he was president and chief operating officer. The magic of networks, he says, is that they create growth, new markets and new business opportunities. **********''Networks create traffic,'' he said. ''You can't size a bridge by counting the swimmers. We're pursuing the same model here that Fedex built a great business on.'' **********Mr. Barksdale's long-range strategy is sound, most analysts say, but getting there will not be easy. The corporate business will build gradually, and big companies are conservative buyers. The first real sign of trouble at Netscape will divert a flood of business to Microsoft. **********So for the next few years, at least, Netscape must report strong growth in revenues and profits, quarter after quarter without faltering. The industry's perception that Netscape has momentum is vital to the company's survival. It needs every cent it can scrape together from selling its browser program and the server software that acts as the hub of computer networks, as well as hawking advertising and electronic commerce deals on its Web site. **********It is up to Mr. Barksdale to keep on course. That means not only moving quickly, but also recovering quickly from mistakes. Earlier this year, Netscape tried to sidestep Microsoft in the browser war by bundling its browser into a product called Communicator, which includes E-mail,  group discussion and conferencing features. **********Yet in August, with customers and corporate partners slow to embrace the bundled program, Netscape reversed course and once again began offering a stand-alone version of its browser. **********The company's ability to recover quickly from such tactical missteps speaks well of Mr. Barksdale and his team, said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. ''Barksdale has done an impressive job so far, but he still faces a huge challenge,'' Mr. Yoffie said. ''The Netscape-Microsoft competition may not be a winner take all. But if Netscape stumbles, a snowballing effect will work to the advantage of Microsoft. Barksdale has very little margin for error.'' **********The Choice **********Join Microsoft, Or Go It Alone? **********Still, the predicament Mr. Barksdale faces today is one he chose freely: he had his chance to side with Goliath instead of David. In 1994, the AT&T Corporation was engaged in the lengthy process of acquiring McCaw Cellular, where Mr. Barksdale was president and chief operating officer. Mr. Barksdale had told AT&T he would stay on through completion of the acquisition and a brief transition period, but no longer. **********With Mr. Barksdale known to be leaving, Netscape was not the only company interested in him. In the summer of 1994, Mr. Barksdale says he was approached twice about becoming the president and chief operating officer of Microsoft. **********But being a high-level underling at Microsoft, he recalled, did not appeal to him. ''Why walk into that snake pit,'' he said. ''I'd be surrounded by three wizards who had done everything and who couldn't be told anything. And I wouldn't be captain of my own ship.''He was referring to William H. Gates, chairman of Microsoft; Steven A. Ballmer, executive vice president, and Nathan Myhrvold, chief technology officer. **********Lured by the opportunity at Netscape, Mr. Barksdale became the company's president and chief operating officer in January 1995, eight months before Netscape sold shares to the public. **********Today, Netscape and Microsoft are bitter rivals, but they considered becoming partners. Microsoft first talked to Netscape about licensing its browser technology in late 1994, when Mr. Barksdale was a director and planning to become chief executive. The licensing discussions did not get very far, Mr. Barksdale says: The Netscape side felt Microsoft offered too little money and wanted access to virtually all its technology. **********The more serious proposal came in the summer of 1995, Mr. Barksdale says, when during a meeting with Microsoft executives at Netscape's offices, one Microsoft executive pulled Mr. Barksdale aside in a hallway and said Mr. Gates wanted to buy a stake of more than 15 percent in Netscape. In return for its cash, Microsoft wanted a board seat and rights to license Netscape technology. As a start-up company about to go public, Mr. Barksdale was told, Netscape could benefit enormously from ''the Bill effect,'' the endorsement of Mr. Gates. **********After weighing the offer, Netscape rejected Microsoft's embrace. ''It could have been a quick start,'' Mr. Barksdale said. ''But I felt that allowing Microsoft on the board was letting the fox in the henhouse.'' **********Netscape's co-founders, James H. Clark, the chairman, who also founded Silicon Graphics Inc., and Marc L. Andreessen, a 26-year-old executive vice president, who helped write the original Mosaic browser at the University of Illinois, are more blunt. Doing a deal with Microsoft, they say, is often an act of corporate suicide. **********''I can't think of one company that collaborated with Microsoft and became a significant company,'' Mr. Clark said. **********In Mr. Andreessen's view, such invitations from Microsoft are ''the Silicon Valley I.Q. test.'' He explained: ''You can say no to Microsoft, and you have to. Microsoft designs partners out of the action, out of the business, in most cases.'' **********All this is revisionist vitrol, according to Microsoft executives, who say Netscape was at least as interested in cooperation as was Microsoft. And if the Netscape side was suspicious of Microsoft's motives, there were also qualms about the rapprochement talks within Microsoft's headquarters. **********''Fool that I was, I was quite optimistic that we could do something together,'' said Mr. Myhrvold, the chief technology officer. ''But there were people inside Microsoft who thought Barksdale was taking advantage of me, just trying to gain knowledge of our Internet plans.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/world/a-key-ulster-protestant-agrees-to-join-talks-with-sinn-fein.html": {"writer_name": "James Clarity", "pub_date": "1997-09-18", "snippet": "David Trimble, head of largest Protestant political party in Northern Ireland, agrees to take part in formal, broad-based peace talks that include Sinn Fein, political wing of Irish Republican Army; is first Protestant unionist leader to agree to ...", "word_count": 577, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Key Ulster Protestant Agrees to Join Talks With Sinn Fein", "print_headline": "A Key Ulster Protestant Agrees to Join Talks With Sinn Fein", "body_text": " **********The leader of the largest Protestant political party in Northern Ireland agreed today to take part in formal, broad-based peace talks that include Sinn Fein, the political wing of the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army. **********By agreeing to enter the talks,  David Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party, became the first Protestant unionist leader to agree to attend negotiations with Sinn Fein since Ireland was divided in 1922 into the independent Irish Free State and the British province of Ulster. **********Mr. Trimble said his first act would be to try to have Sinn Fein expelled from the talks. But officials said such a move would not succeed because the Irish and British Governments, sponsors of the talks, want Sinn Fein at the negotiating table. The talks on the future of this Protestant-dominated British province resumed in Belfast on Monday with the admission of Sinn Fein. **********''We have no illusions about the character of Sinn Fein,'' Mr. Trimble said at Castle Buildings in the Stormont area of Belfast, where the talks are under way. ''We did not invite them to the table, but we are not afraid of them and we're not going to run away. We are not here to negotiate, but to confront and expose the fascist character of Sinn Fein.'' **********But most officials at the talks expected that eventually he would face Sinn Fein across the negotiating table, possibly in the coming weeks. **********Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, said Mr. Trimble was ''play acting,'' but welcomed him to the talks. **********''We will have negotiations,'' said Ray Burke, the Irish Republic's Foreign Minister and chief delegate at the talks.

His remarks echoed those of Mo Mowlam, Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary. **********Mr. Trimble's decision to take part in the talks represented a sharp change in his policy. A year ago, when he controlled enough unionist votes in the British Parliament in London potentially to oust the Government of former Prime Minister John Major, he vowed not to enter talks until Sinn Fein and the I.R.A. guaranteed that disarmament of the guerrillas would begin during the talks.

Then Mr. Trimble accused the I.R.A. of involvement in the non-lethal bombing on Tuesday of a police station in a town west of here. **********The I.R.A. denied involvement, but Mr. Trimble called again for the ouster of Sinn Fein from the talks. The Irish and British Governments declined to expel Sinn Fein, because they believe that without Sinn Fein at the table no significant agreement can be reached. **********Officials and experts say Mr. Trimble changed his mind finally after the province's business leaders urged him to join the talks and recent polls showed that more than 90 percent of his party's supporters felt he should face Sinn Fein across the table, not attack it from outside."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/27/business/business-digest-814695.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 593, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Consumer Optimism Bolsters Growth Outlook **********Reports hinted that consumer spending could remain strong for the rest of the year, driving further strong economic growth. **********The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index rose to 129.1 points this month from 126.3 in July, bouncing back near the 28-year high seen in June.

His official Russian hosts were less amused. They abruptly shut down the impromptu news conference. **********Wrapping himself in the mantle of a diplomat, Mr. Gore began three days of meetings with Russia's top leaders on a lengthy list of issues ranging from plutonium production to oil agreements to religious freedom. **********If Mr. Gore's aides are successful, it will also be a week of high-profile meetings and carefully scripted photo-ops, all intended to direct the spotlight away from the Vice President's political troubles and toward his role as a world statesman. **********To be sure, Mr. Gore and the Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, have been holding these biannual sessions for years -- so many years that the talks are denoted with Roman numerals, like Hollywood sequels or Superbowl games. (This week's meeting is officially known as Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission IX, though the cognoscenti simply call it G.C.C.) **********But this time the public relations team is pulling out all the stops. **********There is, for example, ''the walk in the woods.'' On Monday, Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin will be driven to a lunch spot near a leafy sanitorium for the former Communist and present-day post-Communist elite. They will then stroll through the woods together before a ''prepositioned pool'' of photographers and television cameramen. **********Mr. Gore will be the host of an unusual ''media roundtable'' with American reporters to discuss the intricacies of American-Russian relations. No Russian reporters are invited to this made-for-America event, which his aides hope will give the Vice President a chance to display his policy expertise. **********Mr. Gore's team is also exploring a visit to a Moscow jazz club. That could help overcome the Vice President's wooden image, though it is not yet clear when it would be sandwiched into his crowded schedule. **********American reporters complained earlier this year that they were locked out of a speech Mr. Gore gave to the American Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo. But under the new policy of maximum exposure, the news organizations have been invited to Mr. Gore's opening remarks to the American Chamber of Commerce here. **********Mr. Gore's wife, Tipper, also has a busy public schedule. She will be meeting with characters from the Russian version of Sesame Street and visiting a Russian school that stresses teaching about the environment. **********It would be wrong to think, however, that G.C.C. is all public relations. Each commission session is, in fact, a series of meetings involving American Cabinet-level officials, Russian ministers and seemingly hundreds of aides from both sides. The many issues that Mr. Gore and the Russians will discuss are complicated and often nettlesome. **********The two sides, for example, plan to seal an accord requiring the Russians to alter nuclear reactors in Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk so that they no longer produce weapons-grade plutonium. The Russians had earlier promised to shut down the reactors, only to backtrack after concluding that they needed them to heat the Siberian cities. **********The Americans also want the Russians to return to the Atomic Energy Ministry several American supercomputers acquired for Russia's nuclear program in circumvention of American export restrictions. **********Mr. Gore plans to press the Russians to stop their scientists from helping Iran to develop new surface-to-surface missiles and to curtail nuclear cooperation. **********The Russian Atomic Energy Minister, Viktor Mikhailov, proposed tonight that the United States and Russia jointly monitor the nuclear reactor that Russia is selling to the Iranians. But such a step would not address American concerns that the project would help Iran to develop its nuclear expertise and to acquire nuclear technology. **********On the economic front, Mr. Gore is expected to try to help American companies that have become increasingly frustrated over breakdowns in their multi-billion dollar oil-production agreements with the Russians. **********The Vice President will also press the Russian leadership to reject a bill that the Russian Parliament passed on Friday to protect the Russian Orthodox Church from competition with other Christian faiths. Persuading President Boris N. Yeltsin to block the law will be a herculean chore, since it closely resembles his own draft. **********And that is not to mention discussions on space cooperation, a new tax code, the sale of Russian uranium, environmental issues, and the prospects for Russian ratification of the START II treaty reducing strategic nuclear arms and the international accord banning chemical weapons. **********After the three days of talks, a meeting with Mr. Yeltsin and a news conference, Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin are to leave on Wednesday for Samara, a Volga River city that is under the sway of economic reformers and that welcomes foreign investment. **********For all of the time invested, previous Gore-Cheronomyrdin meetings have rarely produced dramatic results. Mr. Chernomyrdin is more of a status-quo figure than the dynamic free-market advocates in the Russian Government like Anatoly B. Chubais and Boris Nemtsov. **********Nor have the meetings always enabled Mr. Gore to put his best foot forward. Mr. Gore had a awkward moment in 1994 when his meetings coincided with the Russian onslaught on Chechnya. Trying to avoid offending the Russian Government, Mr. Gore described the fighting as an internal Russian problem -- a stance that was soon superseded by Washington's anxiety over the brutal nature of the Russian attacks and the fate of civilians. **********Still, United States officials say the meetings help keep communication channels open and provide a venue for hammering out agreements. Mr. Gore is also practiced in dealing with the Russians, which should enable him to avoid the tentative approach he was criticized for during his trip to China in March. **********And while the Russians may not make many concessions, they seem willing to help Mr. Gore achieve a public relations success. ''Our friendship on the personal level is very important,'' Mr. Chernomyrdin said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/21/business/diller-s-hsn-in-4.1-billion-tv-asset-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1997-10-21", "snippet": "HSN Inc will acquire Seagram Corp's USA and Sci-Fi cable channels and almost all of its Universal Studios television production company for $1.2 billion in cash and $2.9 billion in HSN stock; deal gives Barry Diller, head of HSN, opportunity to es...", "word_count": 814, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Diller's HSN In $4.1 Billion TV Asset Deal", "print_headline": "Diller's HSN In $4.1 Billion TV Asset Deal", "body_text": " **********In a deal that thrusts Barry Diller once again into the thick of entertainment programming, his company, HSN Inc., agreed yesterday to acquire the Seagram Corporation's USA and Sci-Fi cable channels as well as almost all of Seagram's Universal Studios television production company for $4.1 billion in cash and stock. **********HSN, which owns or has interests in 18 television stations, the Home Shopping Network and Savoy Pictures Entertainment as well as a stake in Ticketmaster Group Inc., will pay Seagram $1.2 billion in cash and $2.9 billion in HSN stock, representing 45 percent of HSN's equity. **********The deal gives Mr. Diller the opportunity to establish a broadcast network that might hope to compete with ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox -- or at least to fare better than two other network upstarts, the Warner Brothers Network and the United Paramount Network. **********News of the deal sent shares of both HSN and Seagram higher. HSN climbed $3.25, or 8.4 percent, to $41.875, on the Nasdaq market, while Seagram rose $2.8125, or 8.7 percent, to $35.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********''The deal raises the value of Mr. Diller's TV stations, because he would have more programming assets with which to try and improve their ratings performance over the long term,'' Harold Vogel, an analyst with Cowen & Company, said. **********Mr. Diller, HSN's chairman, who is widely credited with creating the Fox Network for the News Corporation earlier in his career, has subsequently sought and failed twice to re-enter entertainment television programming, by attempting to take over CBS and then trying to outbid Viacom Inc. for control of Paramount Communications. **********Yesterday's deal could enable Mr. Diller to attempt innovative scheduling in both cable and broadcast televison. For example, Mr. Diller said, one plan might be to run new programs on his television stations, which reach 39 percent of American households, as well as on USA Network, a channel available on most cable systems. That might enable HSN to sell national advertising, as does a national broadcast network. **********To avoid scheduling conflicts in a single market, the programs could run on cable and on over-the-air television in different time slots or even on different days. **********To satisfy cable operators who might argue that new cable programming should be available only on their systems -- and not over the air -- HSN might offer cable operators cut-rate or free advertising on its stations, Mr. Diller said. **********''Unless you have the ability to cross-promote your programs, how will anybody know what you have to sell?'' Mr. Diller said. **********He added that he was not abandoning previously announced plans to put local programming on his stations. He said he always expected to offer 10 to 12 hours of local programming a day, and 4 to 6 hours of national programming. **********Under the deal, Liberty Media, the programming arm of Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable operator, which already owns 15 percent of HSN, has the right to increase that stake to 25 percent. **********Liberty could invest as much as $700 million, using both cash and assets, Mr. Diller said. Since Liberty owns interests in a number of cable programming services, it may transfer some of those to HSN as part of its equity investment, further bolstering HSN's cable programming. **********And Liberty's tie to Tele-Communications is expected to help smooth cable distribution for HSN's cable services. Mr. Diller will retain voting rights over both the Seagram and the Liberty shares. **********Also, Seagram has agreed not to buy more HSN stock for four years, after which it can increase it stake to 57 percent. If Mr. Diller dies or decides to sell HSN, Seagram has the right to buy his 8 percent stake and the Liberty stake and to propose a merger for the whole company. **********Since Seagram acquired 80 percent of MCA Inc., the parent of Universal, for $5.8 billion in 1995, investors have been concerned that Seagram did not own sufficient distribution outlets for its film and television programming operations. Now it will  have access to HSN's 18 television stations as a programming outlet as well as retaining distribution rights at USA Network. **********While Seagram is giving up direct management control of some key assets, analysts said that in the long term the new deal would give Seagram a good chance to enhance the  value of those assets. **********''We have answered the TV strategy issue,'' Edgar M. Bronfman Jr., Seagram's chief executive, said yesterday. **********''It doesn't matter if the path takes a decade,'' he said, referring to the agreement to buy back HSN. ''We have the chance to build assets and we want a large diversified media business.'' **********Although Seagram is putting the television production business into the venture, it will retain sole ownership of Brillstein-Grey, a television production company that it bought last year. Universal Television will also continue to produce half-hour comedies, the staple of the network television business. It could also produce programs for both USA Network and HSN's television stations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/31/world/albania-envoy-accuses-italy-in-sinking-of-refugee-boat.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1997-03-31", "snippet": "Senior Albanian officials accuse Italian Navy of causing deaths of dozens of Albanian refugees when one of its vessels rammed and sank boat in which they were fleeing homeland; charges appear to diminish chances that Italian-led security contingen...", "word_count": 856, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Albania Envoy Accuses Italy in Sinking of Refugee Boat", "print_headline": "Albania Envoy Accuses Italy in Sinking of Refugee Boat", "body_text": " **********Senior Albanian officials today accused the Italian Navy of causing the deaths of dozens of Albanian refugees on Friday when one of its vessels rammed and sank a boat in which the Albanians were fleeing their homeland. **********The charges appeared to diminish the chances that an Italian-led security contingent could help stabilize the chaotic political situation in Albania. Italy was preparing today to step up its efforts to lead the military and police contingent for the delivery of food, medicine and other aid, to help prevent the flight of growing numbers of refugees. **********The Albanian Ambassador in Rome, Pandeli Pasko, presented a list today with 117 names of Albanians he said had been aboard the boat when it went down, including 34 survivors who were taken from the sea on Saturday. The bodies of three women and one man were also recovered. **********After he spoke with the survivors, Mr. Pasko said they had supplied the names, mostly of women and children. The refugees were said to have been jammed into the boat's hold when it went down in 2,400 feet of water, and he said as many as 79 more people might have perished. **********''The frigate hit the boat two times,'' Mr. Pasko said in a statement, ''first in the back and then on the side, after which the boat capsized. And according to the Albanians, this was done on purpose.'' **********The Albanian craft was a naval boat apparently hijacked by gangsters in the southern Albanian port of Vlore and used to ferry the refugees to Italy for a price. It sank after it was rammed by an Italian warship, the Sibilla, as it enforced a blockade of the Italian coast. **********Roughly 13,000 Albanians have reached Italy in recent weeks to escape their country's turmoil, which began with citizen protests over failed financial pyramid schemes that wiped out the savings of many Albanians. **********The Italian Foreign Minister, Lamberto Dini, in an interview today in the Turin daily La Stampa, sought to deflect blame for the naval disaster from the Italians, accusing the Albanian vessel of trying to evade the Italian ships that pursued it. After several risky maneuvers, he said, the Albanian boat ''set itself on a collision course with our vessel, which could not avoid it.'' **********The captain of the Sibilla, Maurizio Laudadio, was relieved of his duties today, and Italian officials promised a swift investigation. Officials said high winds and generally stormy conditions had made further efforts at finding survivors or the bodies of victims very difficult. **********The episode is expected to complicate the Italian effort to assemble the multinational security contingent, which was approved on Friday by the United Nations Security Council. The force is to consist of roughly 2,500 soldiers and police officers, with the immediate task of cooperating with Albanian security forces to secure the airport in the capital, Tirana, and the ports of Durres and Vlore, in the south. **********In Tirana today, Parliament, which is dominated by the Democratic Party of President Sali Berisha, voted 97 to 1 to approve the deployment of the contingent. After the vote, Mr. Berisha sought to assure the Italians that the soldiers faced no danger in Albania, where they would find a ''friendly people that appreciates their mission.'' **********But even as Parliament voted, the Foreign Minister, Arjan Starova, denounced the sinking of the refugee boat as a ''national tragedy.'' **********Italian officials said advance units of the contingent could begin arriving in Albania this week. Several European countries, including France, Spain, Portugal and Greece, have said they would consider sending personnel, but only Romania has thus far agreed to supply a force, of about 400 soldiers. **********The naval episode only underscored the complexity of the situation Italy faces. The Government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi feels constrained to take measures to help restore order in Albania, not least to stem the flow of refugees to Italy. It is responding to a wave of anti-immigrant feeling among Italians, who view the refugees as competitors for dwindling jobs, given record levels of unemployment, or who associate them with lawlessness and prostitution. **********The Government in Rome is also under pressure from Italian businesses, which are among the principal contributors to the meager foreign investment in Albania since the collapse of Communism there in the early 1990's. **********This week, Red Cross aid workers in Albania expressed concern that the Italian-led contingent could step into a trap in Albania, given the complexity of the feuding between Mr. Berisha and the coalition Government of the Socialist Prime Minister, Bashkim Fino, which Mr. Berisha accepted only under intense international pressure. **********Indeed, most of the refugees on the Albanian vessel came from Vlore, one of the cities where the Italian-led contingent will be deployed. Last week in Vlore, Mr. Fino's Government reached an agreement with representatives of armed insurgents in the south that was denounced by Mr. Berisha. **********About 7,000 people rallied in Vlore today to denounce Italy over the boat collision, Reuters reported. **********Italian officials say they will not let the naval episode hinder deployment of the security contingent. **********Mr. Dini predicted that deployment would take ''several days,'' yet he acknowledged that it could be ''complicated, involving taking control of ports in cooperation with regular Albanian forces.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/28/business/miscellany.html": {"writer_name": "Tamar Charry", "pub_date": "1997-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Miscellany", "print_headline": "Miscellany", "body_text": " *********** Publishers Information Bureau, New York, said magazine advertising pages in June increased 6.5 percent from June 1996, to 18,992.

Here, the rebels' muscle is still growing, to the point that they have become a competing authority operating parallel to the elected Government in much of the countryside. **********That is one reason a peace proposal put forward by the rebels who freed the hostages is generating discussion among Government officials about starting peace talks to end an undeclared war that has been bleeding this Andean nation for 40 years. **********In a speech read on his behalf during the liberation of the soldiers, the guerrilla leader, Manuel Marulanda Velez, laid out his conditions for a peace accord. He called for the Colombian military to be deployed as a border patrol rather than as a force to maintain internal security; the permanent evacuation by the Government from some municipalities; an end to special emergency zones where civil liberties have been suspended, and the dismantling of groups of citizen-informers that the guerrillas consider legalized right-wing paramilitary groups. **********The talks that led to the liberation of the hostages were the first direct ones between the Government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia since 1991. The organization is one of three guerrilla groups operating in Colombia. **********''The atmosphere has changed; there's a change of attitude on their part,'' said Gilberto Echeverri Mejia, the Minister of National Defense, referring to Mr. Velez's guerrilla organization. **********The Attorney General, Jaime Bernal Cuellar, said the rebels' proposal was ''welcome'' and worth studying, though the details might be thorny. **********Some officials pointed to Guatemala and El Salvador as countries that had negotiated an end to long periods of violence, and asked why Colombia should be different. **********But the enthusiasm was confined largely to the political leadership, and the very suggestion of peace talks irritated key military leaders, who have made no secret of their distaste for a central event in the hostage release -- the evacuation of government soldiers in a vast area in which the release took place. **********Gen. Harold Bedoya, chief of the armed forces, called the delivery of the soldiers a circus. ''When one sees drug dealers saying they're politicians, that's part of the circus,'' he said. The general added that when the army returns to the area it evacuated, it will do so in full force. **********Others, like Alfonso Valdivieso, the former chief prosecutor who recently declared his candidacy for president, said that it was the wrong moment for the Government to negotiate because the guerrillas would be in a strong position. **********That strength was readily visible in Cartagena de Chaira, a pueblo built by internal refugees of a war between liberals and conservatives in the 1950's that claimed some 200,000 lives. The population of the village was swollen by peasants pushed off their land by large landholders, and sustained by those escaping poverty elsewhere in the country. In Cartagena de Chaira, people follow the guerrillas out of fear, certainly, but also because they share a common experience and perspective. **********Several residents said that in the absence of governmental institutions or attention, they turn to the guerrillas to solve daily problems. A woman who is repeatedly abused by her husband may seek redress from the guerrillas, who might require the husband to give the wife money and allow her to leave him. A coca grower said it was also the guerrillas who made coca farmers grow food on two-thirds of their farmland, so the families would not go hungry. **********By default in such areas, the rule of the guerrillas stand as unofficial law. Until the Government reduced the coca trade in the region last year by limiting supplies of gasoline and cement, which are used in producing coca paste, the guerrillas also taxed growers 10 percent of the value of the paste they sold. **********A 10-point plan the guerrillas have issued as their platform includes turning over strategic industries to state ownership, erecting trade barriers to protect domestic crops and industries, and earmarking 50 percent of the budget for social welfare. Such measures might seem out of fashion in many countries today, but  the message does not seem outdated to the huge numbers of of Colombians who live in poverty, or to the millions of small farmers whose crops cannot compete with foreign imports. Beneath a veneer of modernity, these Colombians live in a pre-industrial age. **********The guerrillas have at times been as intolerant of dissent and disobedience as the right-wing paramilitaries. .

In an effort to blunt the rebel advance, Zairian Government forces with little appetite for battle have distributed assault rifles and mortar charges by the planeful to Hutu refugees from neighboring Rwanda. **********Some of the Hutu are militia members who organized mass killings of members of their home country's Tutsi minority in 1994, while others are former members of the Rwandan Army, which was defeated by the Tutsi-led forces now in power in Rwanda. **********The Rwandan Hutu and a few hundred mercenaries recruited in haste from a handful of European and African countries form the backbone of the Zairian Government fighting force in what by any standard has to be one of Africa's least conventional wars. **********Zaire's own soldiers, after blazing a trail of looting, rape and death from the Rwandan border zone, which they fled in November when the rebellion against President Mobutu Sese Seko began, remain twitchy and virtually useless in combat and are mostly left to guard this city. **********Because Kisangani has been sacked by unpaid Zairian Army troops twice already in this decade, the population is wary. Given this mistrust, few soldiers dare circulate in town alone, despite the assault rifles they wear slung over their shoulders. **********''You've got a bit of everything here,'' said one international aid worker with long experience in Zaire. ''Hutu who have participated in genocide, Serbs who are most probably war criminals and, on the other side, Tutsi-controlled forces that are trying to pull off a genocide of their own.'' **********Credible witnesses, from church workers to captured rebels, say Tutsi -- the predominant ethnic group among the Zairian rebels in this region -- have been hunting down young Hutu men as the rebels have advanced inexorably across the country. **********These witnesses said rebels swept into the small town of Shabunda the other day, encircled as many of the 40,000 or so Rwandan refugees as they could, separated out the young Hutu men and machine-gunned an unknown number. The others were simply allowed to go. **********Senior Zairian Army officers gave separate accounts of the ''confession'' of a captured rebel sentinel whom they identified as Matthieu Bafanga. They said he told them two days ago that he had been paid $450 to gather information on the movements of Hutu refugees through east-central Zaire. **********There are as many as 300,000 Rwandans stranded in Zaire. Most are ordinary men, women and children, but it is widely believed that there are also thousands of former Hutu militiamen and soldiers. Many of these people already risk death from starvation, dehydration and disease, but for their pursuers, that is not enough. **********''The goal of the Rwandan Government, and the reason they have supported this rebellion, is that they are determined to exterminate the Hutu fighters for fear that one day they will come back for revenge,'' said one longtime European resident who once fought as a mercenary here and maintains contacts in the war zone. **********The rebellion began with a group of Tutsi who have lived in Zaire for centuries. Since then, Laurent Kabila, a lifelong rebel from faraway Shaba Province, has assumed leadership and successfully expanded the force to include other traditional enemies of President Mobutu, Zaire's longtime dictator. **********If Zaire's insurrection, which has made impressive gains in recent days, has become a bid for outright power by Mr. Kabila, it also remains a continuation of Rwanda's civil war in a new theater, the forested heart of Zaire. **********And for Zaire's embattled Government, led for 31 years by Mr. Mobutu, who is simultaneously fighting advanced cancer, this war is most of all a desperate struggle to hang on to power. **********At the airport here -- where the grim Serbian trainers were sweating profusely through their attempts to train Zairian commandos, who often had no clue as to how to use the new weapons -- an officer made no attempt to minimize the army's problems. **********''The enemy is hitting us in so many places that it is very difficult for me to say where the front is,'' said Lieut. Col. Nufuta B. Kasonga, who traced a spider web of rebel movements with his finger on a map. ''The entire east of the country is affected, and they seem to be able to push wherever they want to. What I can tell you is that there is no way that an African rebellion could achieve all of this by itself.'' **********Colonel Kasonga, like the political authorities in the capital, Kinshasa, insists that Mr. Kabila's rebels have been heavily assisted by the armies of Rwanda, Uganda and, to a lesser extent, Burundi. In recent days, Washington has officially come around to this view, publicly warning those countries to stop destabilizing Zaire. **********Many of the recent battlegrounds, in towns like Bafwasende, northeast of Kisangani, have been strongholds of opposition to the Government for three decades. **********Earlier insurrectionists, known as the Simbas, were chased by Belgian mercenaries through the same forests and bombed from the same skies by CIA-contracted Cuban pilots, veterans of the Bay of Pigs invasion. **********While some Zairian officers spoke with determination about eventually winning a war that they knew they were losing, others, who insisted on anonymity, were far more grim. They bemoaned the undisciplined troops, a corrupt and discredited Government and a population that in many areas has been cooperating with the rebels. **********''There is a grand complicity between the people in most of these areas and the rebels,'' said one senior officer, who shrugged as he spoke of the long odds of his cause. ''We don't get any intelligence from them, and many of them are hunters who have no problem picking up weapons against us. **********''After what the Government and the army have done to the people in this country, who can blame them?'' **********A second officer, speaking in resignation, said winning the war was already beyond this army: ''It is true when they say our soldiers are not motivated. They haven't been paid and haven't been led. The only way out of this now is for the Government to make some gesture.'' **********Suggestions that the Government negotiate its way out of this crisis have been angrily rejected until now. At the same time, the political system has never been more feeble. **********When the opposition called a national strike for Monday to demand the resignation of Mr. Mobutu's Prime Minister, Kengo wa Dondo, every major city in Zaire, including Kisangani, was closed for business. **********Foreign diplomats and Zairian military and political analysts here say that if Kisangani falls to the rebels -- a prospect that some consider likely -- the Government will fall and Zaire will dissolve into chaos. **********People close to the Zairian military say precautions are already being taken for a last stand to defend this city. They say that if the threat to Kisangani materializes, mercenaries in the northeast of the country led by Christian Tavernier, a former Belgian officer who has taken part in numerous mercenary adventures here in the last three decades, will be recalled to mount the city's final defense. **********For some, though, the real danger to Kisangani, where few support the Government and many already hate the army, comes from within. **********Since early in his rule, Mr. Mobutu has deliberately kept his army weak and divided, so that it could never threaten his personalized system of power. Whenever the dictator encountered a threat to his rule, he was able to rely on foreign allies, from the United States, Belgium and France to Morocco and Senegal, to help put down the trouble. **********With the loss of the strategic importance that Zaire enjoyed throughout the cold war, the country also lost the military training and assistance that outside powers once openly competed to provide. **********As a result, in the recent fighting the army has spent nearly as much energy chasing deserting units that were pillaging Zairian towns as it has confronting its battlefield adversaries. **********''It is too late to start training people in a country where the army has no tradition of fighting,'' said one foreign military expert. ''At the first sign of trouble, those soldiers that resist looting fire off all of their rounds in the air, strip off their uniforms and run away.'' **********In recent days, the few commercial aircraft that stop in Kisangani and Kindu, the only major airports controlled by the Government in the east, have been crowded by the families of soldiers who, sensing the rapid approach of trouble, have been fleeing to the capital, Kinshasa. Even as they carry their families' belongings on board, many cling nervously to their rifles. **********The army is feared more for the internal threat it poses. That was nearly realized last week when a soldier who was involved in a deal for diamonds shot and killed a pregnant woman. That night, hundreds of angry people marched on the Governor's home, and witnesses said many of them were shouting, ''We want Kabila!'' **********''All it would take is for a few bad soldiers to start acting up here and this place will go up in smoke,'' said one longtime resident. ''The rebels probably can't bite off something as big as Kisangani yet. But if things go wrong here, the population themselves would become rebels overnight.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/20/business/key-rates-713465.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/22/business/caffeinated-drinks-catering-to-excitable-boys-and-girls.html": {"writer_name": "David Barboza", "pub_date": "1997-08-22", "snippet": "Article on popular new brand of soft drinks called energy drinks or extreme beverages; says beverages are generally high in caffeine and sometimes laced with so-called exotic additives, like Brazilian guarana berries or ginseng; holds products, wh...", "word_count": 1669, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Caffeinated Drinks Catering to Excitable Boys and Girls", "print_headline": "Caffeinated Drinks Catering to Excitable Boys and Girls", "body_text": " **********They can get you ''high'' or give you a quick ''lift.'' Some people just want them for the ''buzz'' or the sheer pleasure of getting a ''rush,'' while others are lured by the possibility of heightening their sexual drive. **********If these descriptions elicit the illicit, that is because they are probably meant to. These are the terms behind the marketing for a popular new brand of soft drinks called energy drinks or extreme beverages. The beverages are generally high in caffeine and sometimes laced with so-called exotic additives, like Brazilian guarana berries or ginseng. And they all appeal to young people. **********The products, which are under fire from some health experts and banned in at least one school, are primarily marketed to teen-agers and Generation X'ers, many of whom have grown up relishing Nike's mantra to ''Just Do It'' and Gatorade's dictum: ''Life is a Sport. Drink it up!'' **********Indeed, the market for such drinks is so enticing that Coca-Cola and Pepsico -- the twin titans of the beverage industry -- have entered the fray by creating their own supercharged brands, which are now hitting the national market. **********The granddaddy of them all is Pepsi's Mountain Dew, the 50-year-old beverage that has been reincarnated in recent years through a marketing campaign that appeals to young people's eagerness to live on the edge. But that is just the beginning. Surge, which is Coke's answer to Mountain Dew, calls itself a ''fully loaded citrus soda'' and advises drinkers to ''Feed the Rush.'' Meanwhile, the label on Josta -- Pepsi's new caffeine-charged drink -- says that ancient Indians believed that guarana berries had a ''raw, primal power.'' **********The aim of all this heavy breathing is clear: to capture a share of the market for fruit juices and caffeinated beverages, one of the fastest-growing segments of the soft-drink business. **********''In today's society, people are trying to get as much boost as they can, and a drink is one way to do it,'' said Gerald Celente, publisher of Trends Journal. ''And caffeine is the new-millennium drug of choice.'' **********What these beverages have in common is the goal of capturing the fickle taste buds of the ''pumped up'' generation, marketers say, those youths who straddle the world between the hip-hop styles of many inner-city youths and the ''extreme sports'' forays of privileged suburban teen-agers. **********''There's sort of this need for sensory overload,'' said Michael Bainbridge, a senior vice president at the Sterling Group, a brand identity consultant in New York. ''People are looking for total stimulation in all walks of life, and beverages are one way to get that.'' **********And if there is any doubt about what these new energy drinks offer, their names leave little to the imagination. Among the labels are Jolt, Hype, Boost, Guts and Zapped. Others with equally aggressive names include X-Treem Caffeine and Game Face, replete with logos of lightning bolts and spike-headed athletes. **********''What the cola companies have found is that cola is dead,'' said Steven Grasse, head of Gyro Worldwide in Philadelphia, an advertising firm that specializes in marketing to teen-agers and 20-somethings. ''Kids are saying, 'Those are the drinks of my grandparents.' '' **********While the beverage giants bring big budgets and sheer marketing power, most of the new energy drinks are being dreamed up by small outfits operating with much narrower margins. Many of them do not even register yet on the charts of soft-drink sales, according to Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. But they are turning up at sporting events, dance clubs and a growing number of convenience stores. **********What worries some critics and educators, though, is that the promotions for these new drinks hint at illegal stimulants. For example, two new drinks -- XTC and Krank20 -- are eerily similar in name to illegal drugs like ecstasy, a hallucinogenic stimulant, and crank, a nickname for methamphetamines. **********XTC, a European import that bills itself as a ''carbonated slap in the face,'' says it offers an ''energetic blend of mystical herbs.'' And a bottle of Krank20 is simply caffeinated water with almost twice the caffeine level of Classic Coke. ''Krank20 is water with caffeine,'' the company boasts at its Web site. ''Lots of caffeine. All that we could get away with. If this stuff doesn't roll your oats, better check your pulse.'' **********Many of the drinks rely on similar innuendo. Several beverage makers, for instance, say that guarana is an aphrodisiac. Jolt Cola, which has been around since 1986, promotes itself as ''soda that pops.'' The label on Guts, which is made in New York, reads, ''Warning: contains high energy.'' And Go Go, a drink that is being consumed by ''ravers'' --  young partygoers -- bills itself as an energy drink that will ''blow your mind.'' **********Beverage makers acknowledge that their marketing of these drinks is designed to be stimulating but insist that the tag lines are not meant to be taken literally. ''I won't deny that there's a certain amount of promiscuity with energy drinks,'' said C.J. Rapp, president of the Global Beverage Company in Pacific Palisades, Calif., which sells Jolt and XTC. ''And I won't deny that that's part of the appeal. But to people of the youth generation, the name XTC is cool. The baby-boomer generation would see it in its literal sense; to Generation X, it's merely a figure of speech.'' **********As for Guts, due out in September, the test-marketing shows that this is just ''what our target audience wants,'' said Michael Lyons, a vice president at Guts Beverages, based in Quebec. Mr. Lyons said the target audience for Guts was originally ages 12 to 24. But after testing, the group was broadened to include children as young as 9. As enticements, the company plans to use cartoon characters: a rhinoceros, dinosaur and a turtle. **********Asked whether 9-year-olds need a ''high energy drink,'' Mr. Lyons said, emphatically, ''They're already drinking Mountain Dew and Dr Pepper!'' Indeed, market research shows that Mountain Dew is more than twice as popular than other soft drinks among children younger than 6. **********Some public health advocates are concerned about the wisdom of pushing young children and teen-agers to consume caffeine, which they say is mood-altering and at least mildly addictive. **********Michael Jacobson, executive director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, said that he petitioned the Food and Drug Administration earlier this month to require foods and beverages to label their caffeine content. **********''Why there's been a surge in caffeinated soft drinks and waters, I don't know,'' he said. ''I guess we're in a somewhat wilder society than we used to be, and people figure they can get a kick out of soft drinks.'' **********Others, such as Margaret Mohrmann, the head mistress at the Academy, a school for gifted students in Little Rock, Ark., are concerned that children, already full of jitters, will become even more hyperactive after drinking heavily caffeinated beverages. **********Last April, the Academy banned Surge from its snack bar after the students drank themselves into a frenzy. ''I just couldn't believe it,'' Ms. Mohrmann said. ''The kids were holding two in their hands and drinking one after another. When they weren't jumping up in the bathroom, they were climbing the walls.'' **********Ms. Mohrmann said the school was going to ''try it again'' but would limit students to one can of Surge a day. **********While the stimulant plays a crucial role in the appeal of such drinks, the rise in their popularity is not so much about caffeine as it is a tale of how beverage makers -- taking their cue from the sports apparel industry -- are trying to sell a life style. Beverage makers are hoping to score in the same way, say, that Tommy Hilfiger fashions did. **********The model for such promotions is Mountain Dew, which markets to youths with irreverent television spots that show young people engaged in sky-surfing, skateboarding, bungee-jumping and other so-called extreme activities. Despite imitators like Kick, which bills itself as the ''hard core, psycho, nitro drink in a can'' and is made by Royal Crown Cola, a unit of Triarc, Mountain Dew has maintained its dominance of the category and is the fastest-growing soft drink in the country. **********The selling of energy drinks in Asia and Europe is even more explicit than in the United States. And it works. In Europe, energy drinks -- with names like Red Bull, Power Kid and Start Me Up -- sold 500 million liters, or 132 million gallons, according to Canadean, a beverage research firm based in London. **********Hans Vriens, the managing director of Red Bull North America, has recently brought the drink -- its slogan: ''Red Bull gives you wings'' -- to the United States. ''Some energy drinks have the good stuff, and some don't,'' Mr. Vriens boasts. ''We have one brand, one size. There are hundreds of copycats. You take a drink called Hype. That's just what it is.'' **********Companies are mixing, blending, spiking and adding ''exotic'' ingredients to try to bolster their drinks in addition to their sales. Last year, Pepsi even came out with a coffee cola, Pepsi Kona -- which urged customers to ''spank your senses'' -- but the drink was pulled after faring poorly in test-marketing. **********But the youth market seems to be the litmus test on new fashions and new drinks. ''The consumption rate among young people is huge,'' said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest in Bedford Hills, N.Y. ''And brand preferences are not yet formed. They're just going into convenience stores and experimenting.'' **********Just when every beverage maker in America appears to have jumped on the energy drink bandwagon, though, youth fashions are moving in new directions. ''People in the underground are now talking about going back to the natural,'' said Joanne DeLuca, a partner at Sputnik Inc., a marketing group that tracks youth trends for companies like Pepsi and Reebok. ''Now they want natural drinks.'' **********But do not count out the high-energy approach just yet. Pepsi, for instance, is said to be at work on a new, caffeinated lemon-lime drink, tentatively named Storm. **********''Teens are looking for a turn-on that doesn't put them in jail,'' said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark L.L.C., a beverage consultant. ''They want more stimulation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/18/business/company-briefs-186465.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********WSMP INC., Claremont, N.C., a restaurant and food processing company, has an agreement to acquire the Sagebrush Inc. restaurant chain, also of Claremont, in a stock deal worth $41.5 million to $44.4 million, based on an exchange ratio of 0.3214 WSMP share for each share of Sagebrush. **********UNIVERSAL SELF CARE INC., Livonia, Mich., a disease management company, agreed to sell most of its assets to the closely held Gainor Medical Management L.L.C. for $37 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/08/world/freed-hamas-leader-suggests-terms-for-truce.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Greenberg", "pub_date": "1997-10-08", "snippet": "Sheik Ahmed Yassin, newly freed leader of militant Islamic movement Hamas, lays out series of positions that seem to hold out prospect of compromise without abandoning traditional aims and methods of Hamas; says suicide attacks on Israel can be su...", "word_count": 806, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Freed Hamas Leader Suggests Terms for Truce", "print_headline": "Freed Hamas Leader Suggests Terms for Truce", "body_text": " **********The newly freed leader of the militant Islamic movement Hamas, guiding it again as a free man, laid out a series of positions today that seemed to hold out a prospect of compromise without abandoning the traditional aims and methods of Hamas. **********Sheik Ahmed Yassin said that suicide attacks on Israel could be suspended under certain conditions, but that an overall truce would require a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the removal of Jewish settlements there. He ruled out permanent reconciliation with Israel. **********The sheik, the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas, spoke to reporters here as he received hundreds of well-wishers, including Yasir Arafat, on his first full day at home after serving eight years of a life sentence in Israeli jails. He was freed last week in exchange for the release of two Israeli agents arrested in Jordan after a failed assassination attempt there against a Hamas leader. He arrived in Gaza Monday. **********Easing back into his leadership role, the sheik seemed to be charting a cautious political course, but the  conditions he spelled out for a suspension of violence seemed highly unlikely to be met by Israel. Nevertheless, David Bar-Illan, communications director for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said that the sheik's remarks were ''worth watching'' and ''a positive development if it means something, not just part of the usual rhetoric.'' **********Mr. Yassin's statements came as  Israeli news organizations reported that King Hussein of Jordan had passed on reports of a Hamas cease-fire proposal to Israeli officials two days before the botched assassination attempt, but that the King's message only reached Mr. Netanyahu a day after the incident. **********Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, the most senior Hamas figure in Gaza after Mr. Yassin, denied today that there had been any cease-fire proposal. ''We have checked with our brothers in Jordan, and there was no such initiative,'' he said. **********Mr. Yassin said it was up to Israel to determine whether there could be a suspension of suicide bombings. **********''The Jews are those who will determine that,'' he said. ''If they stop their attacks on civilians, land confiscation, house demolitions, and release the prisoners and the detainees, then we will definitely ease up, God willing,'' the sheik said. **********A truce with Israel is permitted by  Islam, but not a permanent reconciliation, the sheik added. ''If Israel withdraws completely from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and it removes all of its settlements, I will make a truce with it,'' he said. **********Similar conditions for a truce have been set in the past in leaflets issued by the armed wing of Hamas after bombings in Israel, but Israeli Governments have not taken them to be serious offers. **********Asked if he would press for more suicide attacks if his terms for a truce were rejected by the Israelis, the sheik replied: ''It is inconceivable that a person should stand idly by while his soil is occupied, and his people and homeland are degraded.'' **********He added: ''In our religion it is forbidden to kill a child, a woman or an elderly man, but when you kill my wife, my daughter, my son, I have the right to defend myself.'' **********While insisting that Hamas would not negotiate with Israel, the sheik left a door open to indirect contacts through the Palestinian Authority. ''If we want something, we ask for it from the Palestinian Authority, and it will negotiate about it with Israel,'' he said. ''We don't have two authorities.'' **********While some Israeli security officials have warned that the sheik's return might embolden Hamas to make fresh attacks, Palestinian officials and commentators heard a politically shrewd ambiguity in his remarks today. The sheik's careful language, they said, indicated that he could become a force for moderation within Hamas now that he is no longer behind bars. **********''He's willing to deal,'' said Ziad Abu Amr, an academic expert on Islamic movements and a Palestinian legislator from Gaza. ''He's a little ambiguous, this is his political style, he doesn't want to commit if nothing is offered.'' **********But Sheik Yassin ''will be a moderating influence on his colleagues'' Mr. Abu Amr added. ''He doesn't want to complicate the situation. He is a reformist, still fighting to change his society, not a revolutionary like the new breed of Hamas leadership that was the product of a revolutionary situation -- the intifada.'' **********Although Sheik Yassin's wide popularity in Gaza poses a challenge to the leadership of Mr. Arafat, his return might also provide the moral authority necessary for Hamas and the Palestinian Authority to halt anti-Israeli violence. **********The two men projected a sense of harmony when they met tonight near the sheik's home in the shabby Sabra neighborhood of Gaza. **********Mr. Arafat took the sheik's limp hand and told him: ''God willing, we will pray together in Al Aksa Mosque,'' referring to the mosque in Jerusalem that is Islam's third holiest shrine."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/23/business/cbs-president-resigns-over-revamping.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrie Mifflin", "pub_date": "1997-05-23", "snippet": "Peter Lund, president of CBS television network, resigns after being informed that he will no longer oversee CBS's television stations division; executives say Michael H Jordan, chief executive of CBS and its parent company, Westinghouse Electric,...", "word_count": 544, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CBS President Resigns Over Revamping", "print_headline": "CBS President Resigns Over Revamping", "body_text": " **********Peter Lund, the president of the CBS television network, has resigned after being informed that he would no longer oversee CBS's television stations division, high-level executives within the company said yesterday. **********The executives said that Michael H.

Mr. Karmazin was the president and chief executive of Infinity Broadcasting, which Westinghouse acquired last year for $3.7 billion. **********Mr. Lund then told Mr. Jordan that he was quitting, according to one executive who had spoken with Mr. Lund. **********Mr. Lund, 56, had been president of CBS since 1994. **********''I just didn't agree with the proposed new structure,'' Mr. Lund said last night. ''This is not about Mel -- I think Mel will do a terrific job. But this is a serious difference of opinion on how the responsibilities should be divided.'' **********Whispered word of the resignation quickly spread through a packed cocktail party last evening at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan, where hundreds of advertising representatives had gathered with CBS Entertainment division executives to celebrate after an afternoon presentation to advertisers of CBS's fall prime-time lineup for the coming season. **********Mr. Jordan attended the party, but when questioned by reporters he declined to comment on the Lund matter. **********CBS executives questioned at the advertisers' party expressed shock and dismay at the news. They also said that whatever the merits of the reorganization, to have this upheaval happen on the day the company was trying to make a positive impression on potential advertisers was poor timing. **********''The timing couldn't be worse,'' one senior executive said, citing not only the prime-time presentation yesterday, but the annual meeting of affiliated stations, scheduled for next week in Los Angeles, at which CBS had planned to promote its stability. **********Mr. Lund was popular with CBS station executives, who felt he was on his way to turning the company's fortunes around, and some of them reacted with shock to news of his resignation. **********The resignation greatly increases the power of Mr. Karmazin, whose experience is in radio. **********Indeed, many CBS television executives had already expressed concern, even before yesterday, at a possible increase in power by Mr. Karmazin. **********In June 1996, Westinghouse purchased Infinity Broadcasting for $3.7 billion, giving the corporation 83 stations in 16 markets with total advertising revenue of more than $1 billion. The deal was said to be the largest in the history of radio. **********But the year before, when Westinghouse took over CBS, Mr. Jordan took special care to point out the value of CBS's radio division, and even to express his admiration for its then-rival, Infinity, whose radio personalities included Howard Stern and Don Imus. **********One CBS executive at yesterday's party spoke of a ''palace revolt brewing,'' saying division heads would unite to try to persuade Mr. Jordan to reverse his decision. **********But another, equally high-placed executive said that ''palace revolt is too strong a term,'' despite the widespread respect for Mr. Lund and dismay at the news. **********In November 1995, the Federal Communications Commission approved Westinghouse's $5.4 billion purchase of CBS, which at that time had been running a distant third to NBC and ABC in the prime-time ratings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/16/business/mexico-repays-bailout-by-us-ahead-of-time.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1997-01-16", "snippet": "Pres Clinton says Mexico has repaid the $12.5 billion it borrowed from Washington to stave off financial collapse two years ago, and done it three years ahead of schedule; this ends one of Clinton's riskiest overseas ventures and releases Mexico f...", "word_count": 1404, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico Repays Bailout by U.S. Ahead of Time", "print_headline": "Mexico Repays Bailout by U.S. Ahead of Time", "body_text": " **********President Clinton said today that Mexico had repaid all of the $12.5 billion it borrowed from Washington to stave off a financial collapse two years ago, ending one of Mr. Clinton's riskiest overseas ventures and releasing Mexico from tight economic controls imposed by Washington. **********The repayment of the loan -- three years ahead of schedule -- was marked by a celebration at the White House today presided over by Mr. Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who had warned that a default by Mexico could bring down economies around the world. **********''Two years ago helping our friend and neighbor in a time of need was quite controversial,'' Mr. Clinton said today, a reference to his decision to do an end run around Congress, which refused to act on an emergency package for Mexico, and to lend the cash from funds under the President's control. **********''Some said that we should not get involved, that the money would never be repaid, that Mexico should fend for itself,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''They were wrong.'' He stopped short of naming those opponents, who included Ross Perot, Patrick J. Buchanan and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican. **********Mr. D'Amato made several attempts to stop the transfer of funds to Mexico, declaring in March 1995 that ''the Mexican bailout is a failure'' and that the Administration had made the economic climate in Mexico ''far worse than it needed to become.'' **********Today, Mr. D'Amato issued a terse statement saying that he was ''pleased'' and attributed the quick repayment to ''vigilant Congressional oversight.'' **********In the end, Mr. Clinton said, the United States ran a profit of more than half a billion dollars on the loans. **********That money, which American officials said would go toward deficit reduction in the United States, is above the interest the cash would have earned had it remained in the Federal Reserve's emergency stabilization fund, which was originally designed to steady the dollar rather than the currencies of allies. **********In Mexico City, the news prompted a rally in the stock and bond markets -- in part because paying off the loans meant that the country no longer needed to put up its oil production revenues as collateral. The Mexican stock market rose 2.66 percent today and is up more than 12 percent this year. **********President Ernesto Zedillo declared that the Government had made a ''bold step toward the economic recovery of Mexico.'' **********In fact, what Mr. Zedillo did today was what most prudent homeowners do when interest rates dip: he refinanced. In the seven months that followed the collapse of the peso in December 1994, and the ensuing dance with national bankruptcy, private lenders refused to go near Mexico, only worsening its troubles. **********For that reason, Mexico secured a credit line from the United States of $20 billion, but only needed to borrowed 60 percent of that. But now, with renewed confidence in the Government's reforms -- confidence that some economists warn is premature -- investors around the world are once again rushing to lend Mexico all that it needs. **********So Mr. Zedillo's Government is exchanging high interest loans from Washington with new bonds issued by Mexico. While those bonds carry relatively high interest rates, Mexican officials said today that they would save Mexico about $100 million a year in payments. **********''Some predicted that our country would collapse, that the foreign aid would be unpayable and infringe our sovereignty, and that in the short term we'd be in a worse crisis,'' Mr. Zedillo said in a morning speech in Mexico City. But the early retirement of the debt to the United States Treasury demonstrates, Mr. Zedillo said, ''the coherence and responsibility the Mexican people and Government have shown in these tough times.'' **********The Mexican debt crisis produced some of Mr. Rubin's tensest days at the Treasury, and in private he hinted that he worried throughout the spring of 1995 that it could fail. ''This was Bob Rubin's Bosnia,'' one of his top aides said today. ''And today he got the troops out.'' **********The usually understated former investment banker was clearly reveling in the success of the bailout today. **********In the Roosevelt Room at the White House, Mr. Clinton sidestepped a question about a recent decline in the value of the peso and deferred to Mr. Rubin, explaining ''you've made so much more money than I have.'' **********''There is a point to that!'' said Mr. Rubin, who usually makes no references -- even in jest -- to his huge fortune. **********Back at the Treasury later in the day Mr. Rubin raised an eyebrow when his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers -- who was the first to recognize the possible ripple effects of the crisis in emerging markets and who organized much of the loan effort -- joked that he would settle for just 1 percent of the Treasury's $580 million profit on the deal. **********''Larry, anything you can negotiate, I'm happy to split with you,'' Mr. Rubin shot back. **********While the Administration was eager to describe Mexico today as a patient in recovery, the cost was high for Mexican workers who lost their jobs during the austerity program imposed as a condition of the loans, for homeowners who were unable to pay their mortgages and for businesses that suddenly found themselves caught in a severe recession. **********Crime has soared in Mexico City, the pay of Mexican workers is still badly depressed, and the peso has stabilized but failed to return to its earlier values. While Mr. Clinton made much of the fact that American exports to Mexico were higher today than they were in 1994, before the crisis struck, he failed to mention that the trade deficit with Mexico had surged by nearly $18 billion. **********Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, said in an interview today that Mexico had assembled the funds for its final payment to the United States -- previously it had paid off about 70 percent of its debt -- by selling bonds denominated mostly in foreign currencies in European, Asian and American markets. **********The most recent bonds, which had terms of five to 10 years, generally longer than Mexico had on the United States debt, had yields of 3.35 percent more than United States Treasury securities. **********''That's a lot lower than we were paying a year ago,'' Mr. Ortiz said. The rates, which are also generally lower than those Mexico was paying to the United States, reflect the recovery of international confidence in Mexico's solvency made possible by Mexico's tough economic program and the American bailout, he said. **********''Obviously the crisis took a toll in terms of economic welfare, and incomes are still down from their 1994 level,'' Mr. Ortiz added. ''Consumption has not completely recovered yet. But had we not had the support of the international financial community and of the United States, the consequences would have been much worse.'' **********Nonetheless, average Mexicans will still have difficulty understanding today's debt-retirement celebrations, said Rafael Fernandez, a professor at the Autonomous Technical Institute in Mexico. ''The left will argue that in order to pay off these debts so quickly, Zedillo has had to impose tough austerity, and those that are suffering are the poor,'' he said. **********One of the byproducts of the Mexican crisis was a move by the United States to press for far more extensive disclosure of critical financial information by countries around the world -- data that had they been published by the Mexican Government in 1994 would have made it clear that the country's foreign exchange reserves had dwindled to dangerously low levels. That meant Mexico was unable to pay $29 billion in short-term debt that was denominated in dollars. **********Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers worried during the bailout that they were creating a ''moral hazard'' -- that other countries around the world might see the United States as a lender of last resort in financial crises. **********''I'm not as concerned about that today,'' Mr. Rubin said this afternoon. ''This experience has been enormously painful for the Mexican people. Countries are unlikely to decide that if worse comes to worse, we'll do what Mexico did.'' **********Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers have also worked to set up international emergency funds, to which all nations would contribute, to handle further Mexican-style crises. **********Today Representative James A. Leach of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, praised the success of the bailout but warned that ''great caution is going to have to be exercised in assuming that this is the only or best way to proceed.'' American taxpayers, he said, cannot be ''placed disproportionately in jeopardy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/05/business/grossman-s-says-it-plans-to-file-for-bankruptcy.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-03-05", "snippet": "Grossman's Inc says it plans to seek bankruptcy court protection, but does not provide an exact date (S)", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GROSSMAN'S SAYS IT PLANS TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY", "print_headline": "GROSSMAN'S SAYS IT PLANS TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY", "body_text": " **********Grossman's Inc., a home improvement retail chain based in Canton, Mass., said yesterday that it planned to seek bankruptcy court protection, but it did not provide an exact date.

He was apparently only a month away from returning home when he appeared at the United States Embassy in Cairo on Friday seeking asylum, American officials said. He previously served in the Foreign Ministry, reaching the rank of Deputy Minister. **********The officials said Mr. Chang and his brother, who left Paris with his  wife and two children earlier, apparently had coordinated their defections. **********The United States has not yet officially granted asylum, but rather a temporary status, known as parole, that is the first step toward asylum. The officials said the Koreans would receive full asylum as soon as necessary legal steps were taken. **********The senior official said Mr. Chang might have feared punishment when he returned to Pyongyang, perhaps because he had failed to persuade Egypt to provide more emergency food aid.

In addition, South Korean reports said his son had earlier defected to the West, and presumably he would have faced punishment for that. **********Mr. Chang is North Korea's first Ambassador to defect, although lower-ranking diplomats in Africa defected in 1991 and 1996. **********The most senior North Korean to defect was Hwang Jang Yop, a former member of Pyongyang's ruling council and an early mentor to Kim Jong Il. He sought asylum in Beijing in February and, after a brief stop in the Philippines, arrived in South Korea in April.

Environmental groups and industry associations have been lobbying for years to help shape the proposals that will be on the table. The New York Times asked Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist of at the Environmental Defense Fund, and William F. O'Keefe, chief operating officer of the American Petroleum Institute and chairman of the Global Climate Coalition, an association representing many of America's largest industrial companies, to discuss the issue. Here are excerpts from the telephone debate.   JOHN O'NEIL **********What's at stake in Kyoto? **********O'KEEFE: There are two things at stake. There's the sort of macro issue, which is whether countries can reach rational global policies without resorting to or creating a crisis, and I think this issue has been driven by a crisis approach. But for the U.S., I think it is whether we can enter into an agreement that is responsible but does not impose unreasonable risk and damage to our economic well-being and standard of living, and I think the President's proposal has a high degree of risk associated with it.OPPENHEIMER: This problem was identified 100 years ago, in 1896. So I think finally getting to do something about it is not a crisis approach. I think the key question for Kyoto is: Will our leaders send a signal to industry and to the average citizen that the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are causing climate change are going to be reduced from here on out? Or are they going to put off action until it's too late to avoid Draconian measures? **********What should America's goal be? **********OPPENHEIMER: The U.S. should obtain binding and comprehensive targets that begin to reduce emissions significantly below 1990 levels. And the second part of that is that the agreement needs to provide a flexible framework for implementing those reductions so that they can be accomplished in as cost-effective a manner as possible. U.S. greenhouse emissions were up 3 1/2 percent last year, the most in 20 years. If something isn't done quickly, then the U.S. economy will essentially be out of control with regard to its greenhouse gas emissions. So I think it's important to reach an agreement soon that all parties see as required action, not in 2008 or 2010, but next year. **********O'KEEFE: We need to take into account some objective realities. The developing countries are going to grow. They have access to abundant and reasonably priced fossil fuels. It's hard to see in a decade them turning away from those, and it is true that the Department of Energy projects a very large increase in U.S. emissions between now and 2010. There is no practical technology for reducing those in the short term. We need to look at actions that accelerate the turnover of the capital stock, and invest more heavily in more energy-efficient R and D. **********Can real progress be made without binding targets? **********O'KEEFE: Yes. I think there is a lot that can be done with the export of U.S. technology or developed-country technology to the developing countries. They have to recognize that it's in their long-term interest as well as ours to manage the growth in emissions over the future. I do not agree that it's a foregone conclusion that there's going to be significant climate change if we don't take dramatic action now. We also have to reduce the scientific uncertainties. We should not base policy on worst-case scenarios. **********OPPENHEIMER: Scientific uncertainties, which are substantial, of course, are not a reason to put off action. In fact, we only have one Earth to experiment on. If we're unsure whether we're headed for a headache from climate change or a disaster, we ought to slow our emissions down until we do learn more. **********Without binding targets we'll simply have a rerun of what happened after the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992. The U.S. and Japan are at this point far in excess of their hoped-for emissions and are projected to fail miserably to meet the commitment made at Rio. **********The world's poorer nations say that since rich countries reaped the benefits of burning fossil fuels, they should bear the burden of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. **********OPPENHEIMER: To avoid potentially dangerous levels of climate change, developing countries must participate in a global effort soon. But it's the industrialized countries like the United States that still dominate greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. If the industrialized countries take a credible, meaningful step coming out of Kyoto, then it will be a relatively straightforward matter to convince developing countries to follow soon thereafter. **********O'KEEFE: Looking to the future, developing countries will account for the bulk of future emissions in a very short period of time. And so I think that any program coming out of Kyoto that does not have a substantial component of developing country action is bound to fail. **********There's a lot of talk of this as an intergenerational issue, both from an environmental and economic point of view. What do we owe our great-grandchildren? **********O'KEEFE: There's a history, at least in this country, that every generation has passed on a better standard of living and a better life style. And it would certainly be my view and the view of members of my group that we ought to do that in the future. We ought to work hard to provide global stability and a strong economy in investment and technology. We're not wise enough to know what the world will be like 100 years from now. **********OPPENHEIMER: Yes, we do owe future generations a better life style, a better standard of living, particularly in the developing countries. And that simply is not going to happen unless we bring global warming under control. We owe our great-grandchildren the option of maintaining the sort of stable climate that we've had. And of not committing them now to unrestricted global warming, which they then would have the responsibility themselves to try to bring under control. And which by then could be fruitless. **********What's the most important thing for Americans to keep in mind as the debate unfolds? **********O'KEEFE: I'd begin with saying that they should understand that this is not an issue of either action or inaction. It's a question of what range of actions are taken today and what plans for future actions are taken. All actions have consequences. The President and the Vice President were told at their White House conference by an eminent economist that efforts to return CO2 emissions to the 1990 levels by 2010 would be reminiscent of the energy price shocks of the 1970's. Those are his words, not mine. They should also not reject common sense and the fact that we're talking about what's going to happen in the middle of the next century. The climate has always been variable. **********It is not practical or realistic to think of a stable climate. We don't know if what we're doing today is going to produce the worst case outcomes that some people postulate and we should move very cautiously before we damage current generations and the aspirations of the next generation. **********OPPENHEIMER: The main things that I would emphasize about the general characteristics of the problem are that they're continuous. As long as the gases are emitted the Earth will continue to warm. We know of no practical limit on the problem. No. 2, the gases stay in the atmosphere for a very long time, centuries in some cases, once they're emitted so that the problem is effectively irreversible. Third, there's a lag between the emissions and the full consequences thereof, so the full effects of today's emissions will not be felt for several decades. In that kind of scenario, a wait-and-see approach just doesn't make any sense. **********Are you an optimist or a pessimist on the subject? **********OPPENHEIMER: Personally, I'm an optimist. I think that the average citizen is becoming aware that something is gradually going awry with the climate, that this is a problem that needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. **********O'KEEFE: I'm an optimist. And I would describe Dr. Oppenheimer as a pessimist. I believe as the American people learn more about this and learn the facts about what's happened with the climate over the past hundred years and the economic consequences of precipitous action, they will send the right signal to the President and the Congress."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/10/world/right-to-protest-in-hong-kong-to-be-cut-back.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1997-04-10", "snippet": "China will impose more stringent controls on public protest and free association in Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997; proposed controls include requiring all organizations to register with police, restrictions on public d...", "word_count": 1220, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Right to Protest In Hong Kong To Be Cut Back", "print_headline": "Right to Protest In Hong Kong To Be Cut Back", "body_text": " **********In a severe blow to civil liberties here, the man appointed by China to run Hong Kong after July 1 announced plans today to impose more stringent controls on public protest and free association. **********The proposed controls, which offered the first detailed glimpse at how China will run Hong Kong, include requiring all organizations to register with the police, restrictions on public demonstrations and allowing the government to ban some organizations altogether. **********Although the measures are officially subject to a period of public consultation, they are regarded as certain to be adopted by the new Beijing-appointed body that will replace Hong Kong's elected legislature after July 1. **********Last year China made clear that it would not tolerate Hong Kong's liberal laws on protest and association, laws passed by the British colonial administration after Chinese soldiers killed hundreds of protesters in the Tiananmen demonstrations in 1989. **********In a document issued today, Tung Chee-hwa, the shipping magnate chosen by China as the territory's first Chief Executive, declared, ''Hong Kong is extremely vulnerable to external forces.'' **********Mr. Tung insisted that the new Government that will take over the British Crown Colony must ''strike a balance between civil liberties and social stability, personal rights and social obligations, individual interests and the common good.'' **********While China declared earlier this year that it would repeal several key civil liberties laws, today's announcement provided the first details. The measures were immediately denounced both by Hong Kong politicians and the British colonial Government. **********''The proposal is a regressive step for civil liberty in Hong Kong,'' said Yeung Sum, a leader of the Democratic Party, which has been critical of China's plans for Hong Kong. ''It is a bad message to people outside of Hong Kong that civil liberties here will be restricted.'' **********Governor Chris Patten, who supported ending restrictions on civil liberties that had been imposed by Britain, said, ''Is it really our message to the world in 1997 that where everywhere else, almost everywhere else anyway, freedom is being enhanced, in Hong Kong we have got to edge back a bit from the freedoms we enjoy already?'' **********The Chinese Government and Mr. Tung have maintained that the liberalized civil liberties laws introduced by the British colonial Government in 1992 and 1995 violate the Basic Law, the constitution drawn up for Hong Kong as a result of negotiations between China and Britain in 1984. **********Under Mr. Tung's proposal, all organizations and societies will now be required to register with the police. In the past, organizations merely had to notify the Government of their existence. In addition, the Government will have the power to ban any organization ''in the interests of national security'' as well as in any instance where it is deemed necessary for the ''protection of the rights and freedom of others.'' **********And in a move seen as directly aimed at Hong Kong's Democratic Party, Mr. Tung's proposal would ban any group receiving contributions from abroad. Martin Lee, the chairman of the Democratic Party, is currently touring the United States and Canada raising money for the party. **********Another of Mr. Tung's proposals will require groups organizing protests and demonstrations to seek permission from the police seven days in advance. Mr. Tung's proposals would give the police wide latitude in banning protests, including prohibiting any protest that is ''not in the interests of national security.'' **********Mr. Tung, who has expressed his admiration for the authoritarian rule of Singapore's Lee Kwan Yew and Malaysia's Mohammed Mahathir, both of whom have sharply limited political activity in their countries, has regularly stated his intention to impose more austere limits on Hong Kong's political freedoms. In China, all dissent is banned. Some political dissidents have received long prison sentences just for writing letters critical of the Chinese leadership. **********Michael Suen, a former civil servant who has been detached to help Mr. Tung prepare to take over the reins of government on July 1, said human rights lobbyists like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch were likely to be allowed to continue to work in Hong Kong ''as long as they do not engage in the political process in Hong Kong.'' **********''They can comment freely on Hong Kong as long as they do not become involved in the political process,'' he said. **********Human Rights Watch Asia, which is based here, regularly issues reports critical of China, whether it involves deaths in orphanages due to official neglect or abusive practices in labor camps. It was not immediately clear whether these groups could continue to operate from Hong Kong as critics of China. **********Mr. Suen defended the incoming government's harsher approach to civil liberties. **********''The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government is committed to the continued protection of human rights and personal freedoms as provided for in the Basic Law and in the international covenants which are applicable to Hong Kong,'' he said at a news conference today. **********''However, we must also strike a balance between civil liberties and social stability, personal rights and social obligations, individual interests and the common good,'' Mr. Suen said. ''Within the generality of this commitment, we seek to establish broad consensus among the people of Hong Kong as to where the balance should lie.'' **********Mr. Tung has repeatedly criticized what he says is the ''over-politicization'' of Hong Kong and has said he will take steps to make it more difficult for political parties to function in Hong Kong. Already, steps are under way to change Hong Kong's system of elections so the Democratic Party's influence will be severely diluted. **********In 1992, the colonial Government scrapped restrictions on the formation of societies and organizations and passed a law merely requiring groups to notify the Government of their formation. In 1995, another law was passed removing the requirement that protesters obtain permission from the police to demonstrate. Both of these steps were attacked by China, which has remained adamantly hostile to any form of political protest and political organizations. **********In 1991, the Hong Kong Government passed a Bill of Rights Ordinance, a law urging, although not requiring, that all future laws be consistent with a series of basic civil rights outlined in an international treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. China has objected to this law as well. Today, however, Mr. Tung's office announced that certain provisions of the Bill of Rights were automatically void because China's rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, has said so. **********China, and today Mr. Tung's office, said the step by the British Government liberalizing the civil liberties laws violated the Basic Law. But neither Mr. Suen nor the proposals released by Mr. Tung's office offered any indication of how this was so. **********Mr. Yeung of the Democratic Party, which won the largest number of seats in Hong Kong's legislature in the elections of 1995, described Mr. Tung's move as the wrong approach for Hong Kong. **********''This is an infringement on people's liberties,'' he said, in an interview.

When the planes collided, 349 people were killed. **********The investigation was delayed for several months while Indian aviation officials and the two airlines wrestled over procedures for transcribing information stored in the black-box flight recorders recovered from the two planes. Eventually, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders for the Saudi airliner were taken to the Farnborough aviation research center in Britain, and the Kazakstan airliner's to a similar research center in Moscow. **********Documents submitted to a judicial inquiry in New Delhi in recent days have confirmed the principal cause of the crash -- the Kazak pilot's action in ''busting'' the altitude set for his descending aircraft by air traffic controllers at Indira Gandhi International Airport. According to those documents, which reflect the investigations in Britain and Russia,  the Kazak plane was at a height of 14,190 feet 26 seconds before the collision, just above the 14,000 foot altitude the controllers set for the Saudi plane. **********The Saudi airline has told the inquiry that the Kazak plane was responsible for the collision. But the Kazak airline has said that ''severe air turbulence'' encountered by the Ilyushin 30 seconds before impact caused the plane to drop below its assigned altitude. The Saudi airline has rejected that, noting that the Russian flight crew of the Ilyushin made no mention of turbulence or a sudden drop in altitude on the aircraft's cockpit tape. **********Both airlines have also said that failings of the Indian air traffic controllers played a major part in the crash, including the fact that the Saudi plane's crew was never told that the Kazak aircraft was approaching it from the opposite end of the same narrow air corridor. By reserving most airspace around the Indian capital, the Indian Air Force has forced civilian flights approaching the New Delhi airport to arrive and depart along a narrow funnel of airspace, separated by 1,000-foot vertical intervals. **********The cockpit tapes showed that the radio operator of the Ilyushin, Egor Repp, was told by the New Delhi tower 38 seconds before the impact that the Saudi aircraft was eight miles away, approaching the Ilyushin at 14,000 feet. However, at the time, according to the Ilyushin's flight data recorder, it was flying less than 500 feet higher, 500 feet below its assigned altitude, and descending. The tapes showed that the Saudi pilot, unaware of the approaching Ilyushin, glimpsed the Kazak airliner only moments before impact, too late to move out of the way. **********Exchanges inside the Ilyushin cockpit showed how nonchalance turned to panic. Although Mr. Repp, the radio operator, relayed to the pilot the air traffic controller's warning about the oncoming Saudi aircraft and the need for the Ilyushin to remain at 15,000 feet, 21 seconds passed before the pilot, Gennadi Cherepanov, asked Mr. Repp what altitude he was supposed to maintain. ''Keep the 150th, not descending,'' Mr. Repp replied, using aviation jargon for 15,000 feet. **********Moments later, Mr. Repp repeated his appeal for the Ilyushin to gain height. ''Get to 150!'' he shouted, just as Mr. Cherepanov, the Ilyushin pilot, cried out in alarm. The last sound on the cockpit tape was of a muffled crash. **********All 37 people aboard the Ilyushin, mostly Russians from Kirgizia on a shopping trip to India, and all 312 people aboard the Boeing, mostly Indians en route to jobs in Saudi Arabia, died when the two aircraft hit the ground in an arid farming area west of New Delhi. **********The Indian judge, R. C. Lahoti, is expected to release his conclusions on the crash later this month. The Saudi airline has suggested that, in addition to errors by the Ilyushin crew, the judge put part of the blame on the the Ilyushin-76 plane itself. **********Features that have been cited include the fact that the Ilyushin, designed as a Soviet military transport, had altimeters marked in meters, instead of feet, requiring the crew to make conversions, and an awkward cockpit layout that separated the pilot and radio operator. The fact that the Russian crew members had to speak to the controllers in English compounded the ''utter confusion'' in the cockpit, the Saudi airline has said. **********Another focus of the inquiry has been India's antiquated air traffic control system. At many airports, including New Delhi, controllers rely on radars that tell them the distance of aircraft from the airport, but not the height or direction. New American-made radar systems were to have been installed at New Delhi, Bombay and Calcutta by 1995, but have been delayed. As a result, controllers rely on pilots to report their altitudes. Transcripts of tapes in the November crash have shown that the Ilyushin crew never confirmed to the controller that the aircraft had received or obeyed the instruction to remain at 15,000 feet."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/01/business/mellon-bank-unit-to-buy-a-bankers-trust-portfolio.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-07-01", "snippet": "Mellon Bank Corp says its Mellon Mortgage Corp subsidiary will buy commercial servicing portfolio of Bankers Trust's Corp Trust and Agency Group; terms undisclosed (S)", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MELLON BANK UNIT TO BUY A BANKERS TRUST PORTFOLIO", "print_headline": "MELLON BANK UNIT TO BUY A BANKERS TRUST PORTFOLIO", "body_text": " **********The Mellon Bank Corporation said yesterday that its Mellon Mortgage Company subsidiary would buy the commercial servicing portfolio of Bankers Trust's Corporate Trust and Agency Group.

The city of Moscow, once the capital of global Communism, could soon be the parent of an American mutual fund. **********And no ordinary mutual fund, at that. Lexington Troika Dialog Russia has been, for much of this year, the best performer among all mutual funds in the United States. Before Russian stocks caught the contagion that swept from Asia to other emerging markets in October, the fund had gained more than 130 percent in 1997. **********It has not fared as well lately, however, with the market turmoil of the last two months slashing the fund's value by more than a third. So although Lexington Troika remains up 60 percent since Jan. 1, most shareholders have lost money because they bought their shares after the fund had run up those huge gains. **********The turmoil extends to Troika Dialog Asset Management, part of the Moscow-based brokerage firm that co-manages the fund's portfolio with the Lexington Management Corporation, a New Jersey-based mutual fund company. Troika Dialog is to be sold early next year to the Bank of Moscow, whose majority owner is the municipal government of Russia's capital city. Shareholders of the Lexington Troika fund are scheduled to vote on one aspect of the transaction on Dec. 19. **********Why should investors care? The city is in the midst of privatizing hundreds of municipally owned enterprises. And while such deals in Russia have been marked by almost unfettered cronyism, the American regulators who oversee Lexington Troika can be expected to take a harsh stance on investments by the fund that are done at anything less than arm's length. If Russia's markets are the wild, wild West, the Securities and Exchange Commission can play the tough sheriff, even from afar. **********And then there are the unanswered questions about the future involvement of the fund's founder, Peter Derby, a Jamaica, Queens, native who over the last seven years built Troika Dialog into Russia's biggest brokerage firm. He will not disclose what he is getting from the Bank of Moscow for selling, and he is noncommittal when asked what his continuing relationship with Troika Dialog and the fund will be. **********But it is hard to see how the fund's shareholders can win. To the extent that Mr. Derby distances himself from the fund, they lose the benefits of his investing prowess, including the contacts that have helped the fund to make timely investments. To the extent that he remains involved, his motives will be different: As one of Russia's premier merchant bankers, he will profit by promoting investments to the fund rather than in making the fund perform well for shareholders. **********For investors who bought shares of the Lexington Troika fund early, 1997 has been a vastly successful year. But for the majority of shareholders, the recent upheaval offers a cautionary tale about the hazards of investing in emerging markets. **********Recent sharp drops in stock markets in Asia, South America and Eastern Europe prove that the strategy of spreading assets across the globe, in the hope that sovereign markets will act independently, remains a theory at best. And despite a global communications revolution that can instantly link an investor in Iowa with an executive in Irkutsk, there remain vast differences in securities regulations, accounting methods and the simple realities of doing honest business between West and East -- differences that make investing in emerging markets far more risky than some mutual fund companies would have investors believe. **********''These issues get raised in emerging markets all the time,'' said Julie Allecta, a specialist in mutual fund law at the San Francisco firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker who was formerly a lawyer at the S.E.C. ''But they seem to exist in Russia to an inordinate degree. And in a place like Moscow or Russia, where cronyism is vital, the issues become much more substantial.'' **********FEW entrepreneurs, if any, have been more successful in negotiating a path through Russia's fledgling securities business than Mr. Derby, 37, who moved to Moscow in 1990. He has since created a one-man financial conglomerate comprising Dialog Bank, a commercial bank; the Development and Restructuring Bank, a merchant bank; a related insurance company; Troika Dialog, the brokerage and investment banking firm, and its subsidiary that is co-manager of the fund. **********Yet some participants in the close-knit Moscow brokerage community are still shaking their heads in wonder at Mr. Derby's decision in July to sell a portion of Troika Dialog -- which, given the explosion of underwriting business in Russia, is one of his most attractive businesses. Last week, at a Russian investment conference in New York, several expressed surprise when informed of Mr. Derby's sale of the remainder of Troika Dialog in the pending deal, which was disclosed only when the Lexington Troika fund filed a proxy statement in the United States last month. **********And to these rivals, his decision to choose the Bank of Moscow over a foreign partner -- even as some of Troika Dialog's competitors were forging links with rich Western investment banks -- is the deal's most curious aspect. **********In its recent ranking of the top 100 banks in Russia, the Moscow-based publication Russia Review ranks the Bank of Moscow the country's 12th-largest bank in total assets. But in terms of available capital, it ranks 32d. In a separate creditworthiness ranking by IC Rating, a Russian bank research firm, the Bank of Moscow sits squarely in the middle of the pack. **********The bank does have one promising asset, however -- its link with the City of Moscow, a municipality that is essentially the realm of one man, Mayor Yuri Luzhkov. Executives in the Russian securities industry say a relationship with the Mayor is as important to generating business as any link with a foreign partner. **********One executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his desire to continue to do business with the city, likened Mr. Luzhkov's influence to the power once wielded by Chicago's legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley. ''Like Daley, Luzhkov has got his fingers in a lot of pies,'' the executive said. **********THE Mayor was traveling last week and could not be reached for comment on his ties to the Bank of Moscow and whether he would have any involvement with Troika Dialog. But Mr. Derby said of Mr. Luzhkov: ''Troika Dialog's honesty and integrity are its main assets, as he sees it. He wants to make sure the firm grows properly.'' **********Moscow's Mayor is not likely to be picking stocks for the Lexington Troika fund. But the fund's managers clearly hope to benefit from its new ties. ''The bank's relationship with the City of Moscow places Troika Dialog in an excellent investment banking position for the companies yet to be privatized by the City of Moscow,'' states the Lexington Troika fund's latest proxy statement. **********''That's troublesome,'' Ms. Allecta said. ''They seem to be saying they have access to inside information, that they can manipulate the market because they can control the timing of certain entities being privatized.'' **********Richard Hisey, a managing director at Lexington Management, the Saddle Brook, N.J., firm that markets Lexington Troika to American investors, said that the fund was comfortable that it would remain in compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940, the governing statute for the mutual fund industry. **********''The fire walls have been set up'' to protect against conflicts of interest, he said. **********Bruce Bean, a lawyer in the Moscow office of the Coudert Brothers law firm who has monitored events surrounding the fund, said investors should be protected by virtue of the fund's operation under S.E.C. oversight. ''Russian law and regulation in this area is clearly underdeveloped,'' he said. ''But American mutual-fund law is overdeveloped.'' **********But investors cannot count on the fund's stellar performance surviving a management shake-up. **********As chairman of Troika Dialog, Mr. Derby had substantial input into the firm's management of the Lexington Troika fund. So shareholders are bound to wonder if, after the sale, the fund's manager will lose much of the expertise that helped it to rack up big gains this year. **********For most of the fund's 18-month existence, Mr. Derby said, he has provided big-picture investment ideas but left the stock-picking to a team led by Gavin Rankin, the Moscow-based head of research for Troika Dialog. Meanwhile, the fund's broad strategy has been overseen by Mr. Hisey, who works for Lexington in the United States. The two companies split equally the fund's management fee of 1.25 percent. **********But Mr. Derby acknowledged that he often took a more direct role. ''I built this firm from scratch,'' he said. He continues to refer to the Troika Dialog companies as ''my children.'' And at times, he said, he stepped in to personally supervise the fund's investments. **********''When there were certain excesses in the market -- huge volumes, high volatility or questions of a political nature that affected the fund -- I had the dominant say,'' he said. ''The alliance with the Bank of Moscow, going forward, will change that.'' **********But not entirely. ''Of course, I will continue to maintain relationships with the management and individuals at Troika Dialog, and we will continue to work together when it's prudent to do so,'' Mr. Derby said. ''I think we can go in with Troika Dialog on some of our transactions since we have this personal relationship.'' **********BET if the cord is not being fully severed between Troika Dialog and its founding father, shareholders in the Lexington Troika fund may want to know how Mr. Derby's interests will compete with their own. For answers, investors in Lexington Troika, like shareholders of all funds, will have to rely on the managers and independent directors -- most of whom are based in the United States. **********S.E.C. officials look closely at potential conflicts of interest, especially when they occur in foreign markets. In its oversight of funds that invest heavily in developing markets like Russia, ''we ask funds to consider and describe any problems that might be material from the perspective of investors,'' said Barry Barbash, director of the S.E.C.'s mutual fund division. **********In Lexington Troika's case, that results in several eye-numbing pages of the fund's prospectus, devoted to warnings about the possible negative effects of adverse political or diplomatic developments, social instability, expropriation or nationalization of assets, armed conflict in Chechnya, tensions between the President and the legislature, unrest caused by military downsizing, inexperience of corporate managers, lack of modern technology, lack of capital, high inflation, high taxes, dependence on foreign economic aid, and stock market speculators -- among other conditions. **********The danger, regulators acknowledge, is that the disclosures are so overburdened with descriptions of possible negative outcomes as to make all the warnings seem irrelevant. **********Of course, the biggest concern of the fund's shareholders may be the losses most are now sitting on. **********Numbers supplied by AMG Data Services, an Arcata, Calif., company that tracks the flow of cash in and out of mutual funds, show that two-thirds of the new investment into Lexington Troika this year came in the third quarter, after the fund's value had soared 78 percent in the first six months. **********In doubling the fund's assets in a matter of weeks, those new investors bought their shares at prices in the low- to mid-$20's. Last week, though, the fund's net asset value fell below $17 for the first time since early May, before rebounding to about $18. **********Another measure of the fund's recent problems: Despite its shining performance in the first half, Lexington Troika this year has lost about $15 million in investors' money, according to AMG Data's numbers through the end of November -- and $1 out of every $3 invested since the end of June. **********TO be sure, some of the fund's sharp gains and subsequent losses were results of frenzied activity in the overall Russian stock market and had little to do with specific stock selections by the fund's managers. **********Nevertheless, the fund's portfolio poses substantial risks of its managers' making. **********At the end of June, the date of the last semiannual disclosure of the fund's entire portfolio, 13 percent of Lexington Troika's assets were in ''illiquid securities,'' defined in the prospectus as those that cannot be sold within seven days ''without taking a materially reduced price.'' Included among those were the fund's second-largest holding at the end of June: six million shares of Sibneft, an oil and gas company, which represented 4.2 percent of the fund's assets and 6 percent of its equity holdings. In the Russian market, analysts say, shares of all but the largest of formerly state-owned companies can be hard to trade in volatile markets. **********Last week, Mr. Hisey said that the percentage of the fund's assets in illiquid securities was still about the same, adding that those stocks had taken ''a haircut along with the other holdings in the fund's portfolio.'' **********Mr. Rankin, the Troika Dialog research director, noted that during the late October crash in the Russian market, it became essentially impossible to trade those illiquid securities. **********''You had what always happens when there's a crash: the focus was on liquid names, and on the illiquid ones there was really very little trading done,'' he said. ''Many investors who spent a considerable amount of time to build up those positions in second- and third-tier stocks were reluctant to fire-sell them.'' **********HOW does a mutual fund value its holdings of rarely traded Russian stocks that no one wants to buy? That question, too, troubled the S.E.C. when Lexington Troika first asked for permission to sell its shares, said Mr. Bean, the Moscow lawyer. **********To gain approval, the fund agreed to keep about 15 percent of its assets in ''very liquid assets'' like United States Treasury issues, according to the prospectus, so that it could meet redemptions in the event of large shareholder withdrawals. Indeed, Mr. Hisey said that since the October market decline, the fund's cash position had climbed even higher, to about 30 percent of assets. **********That means that the fund sold some of its more liquid stocks while continuing to hold most of its illiquid ones, he said. **********Undoubtedly, many, if not most, Lexington Troika shareholders knew they were making a volatile investment. And the crisis in the Moscow market has not passed. ''I see the short-term volatility continuing here for at least a few months,'' Mr. Hisey said. **********Mr. Rankin concurs. With large emerging markets like South Korea and Brazil facing their own problems, investors in those countries -- which were major holders of Russian Government bonds -- have been pulling money out of Russia. That could further dry up the Moscow market's liquidity, as could the fact that Korea and other troubled Asian countries are big markets for Russia's production of basic materials, like steel. **********In the long term, both managers, predictably enough, are optimistic. But investors may want to heed the observation of Mr. Rankin, who notes that much of the rise in the Russian securities market earlier this year came from ''one-time revaluations'' of Russian industries. **********Among the stocks that performed the best, he cautioned, ''there were not a lot of long-term growth stories.'' **********Billy Joel, Glasnost, and Opportunity **********Peter Derby said it was a 1987 trip to Russia in the entourage of Billy Joel, the pop singer, that opened his eyes to the opportunities there. **********''I saw a lot of young people who looked just like the audiences at Madison Square Garden,'' said Mr. Derby, who served as a translator during the historic concert tour. ''At the time, Gorbachev was talking about glasnost, telling young people to go out there and have a life.'' **********In developing his securities business, Mr. Derby said, ''I wanted to be there to provide legitimate answers for them.'' **********In the process, he undoubtedly has made himself very wealthy, though he won't disclose details of his finances. His firm, Troika Dialog, has been the top trader among all brokerage firms operating in the rapidly growing Russian securities market, beating out esteemed competitors like Credit Suisse First Boston. **********Not bad for a child of immigrants. **********''I grew up speaking only Russian at home in Queens until I was 5 years old,'' Mr. Derby said in an interview last week in New York, where he was attending a conference on Russian markets. ''When I went to Russia, I found the people there just like my family. I wanted to help them, but not to take advantage of them.''

The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.78 percent,  from 6.83 percent on Friday. The bond market was closed on Monday for the Rev.

And the first trade, after terms were announced at noon, was at 3.55 percent, traders said. But then they fell. **********The trades were on a when-issued basis, meaning they will be concluded only after the bonds are issued. And traders noted that when-issued trading was often volatile and might not completely reflect investor demand for the new securities. **********''The initial market action indicates there is demand for the bonds,'' said Dan Bernstein of Bridgewater Associaties. ''The question is how representative it is.'' **********The Treasury said $7 billion of the bonds would be auctioned, in the first of quarterly auctions. An investor will get a smaller coupon payment than is available on a normal 10-year Treasury note. Were the initial auction rate to be 3.50 percent, the investor would get a payment of $175 twice a year on a $1,000 bond. By contrast, the yield on normal 10-year Treasuries now is 6.50 percent, for a semiannual payment on a new issue of $325. **********But a buyer of the new inflation-protected bonds will see his principal rise each six months, by the amount of inflation.

Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates said similar securities in Canada had a real yield of about 4.25 percent, while those in Britain brought a real yield of almost 3.5 percent. **********The rally in the bond market came as Mr. Greenspan testified before the Senate Budget Committee.

In a raid of Columbia hospitals and doctors' offices, agents with search warrants carted off truckloads of billing and medical records. The inquiry appears, at least in part, to involve the company's dealings with Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly. **********But a yearlong examination of Columbia by The New York Times has found that the company faces problems on several fronts. The Federal agency that runs Medicare is trying to determine if certain Columbia hospitals engaged in a practice known as upcoding, in which hospitals receive larger payments from Medicare by inflating the seriousness of illnesses they treat. **********''A specific review is going on of upcoding at Columbia hospitals,'' said Bruce Vladeck, the head of the agency, the Health Care Financing Administration. **********In addition, Federal civil and criminal investigators are examining whether it is illegal for Columbia doctors with a financial interest in outside medical services associated with the company's hospitals -- like home care and rehabilitation -- to send patients to them. **********The Times's examination of Columbia, including a computer analysis of more than 30 million billing records, casts some light on the Government's concerns. Among the findings were these: ***********Many Columbia hospitals bill Medicare for high-paying respiratory treatments far more often than do competing hospitals serving similar populations. Federal authorities called such findings an indication of possible overbilling of the program. ***********In Texas, where Columbia has its greatest number of hospitals, Medicare paid unusually high amounts for Columbia patients who received costly services like home care. Mainly because of Columbia's use of these services, Medicare pays nearly 10 percent more for treatment that begins at a Columbia hospital than at other Texas hospitals. That meant extra Federal payouts of nearly $50 million in 1995, the last year for which data are available, the analysis shows. ***********In a Federal-state investigation last year in Florida, law-enforcement agents interviewed four hospital officials who said they or their colleagues had been offered enticements or approached about jobs while Columbia was trying to buy their institutions. The inquiry was closed without prosecution, but a memo summarizing the inquiry has been referred for review to a dozen other law enforcement agencies. **********Columbia executives said that the company's policies and practices adhered to the law, and that its use of medical services outside the hospital were in the best medical interests of its patients. **********As for billing practices, the executives attributed any disparities between the company and its competitors to Columbia's more efficient operation. Rather than billing too much, the executives said, its competitors are billing too little. **********''We believe that Columbia is more efficient in accurately billing the Medicare program than are our competitors,'' said David Manning, a Columbia vice president. He said that the company maintained an internal compliance program that was charged with making sure Medicare was billed appropriately. **********In response to the Federal-state inquiry in Florida, a company spokeswoman, Lindy B. Richardson, said Columbia could not comment completely because it had not seen the summary memorandum, which describes the testimony obtained by the Government. But she added that based on The Times's description the testimony appeared to be uncorroborated by documents, ''thus undermining the credibility of the allegations.'' **********The investigations of Columbia's Medicare billing practices come as the Clinton Administration has introduced legislative proposals to crack down on fraud and abuse in the program, which many in Washington fear could go broke in less than five years. **********Columbia, which is based in Nashville, has been a leader in the impressive revival of the nation's for-profit hospital business. Not yet 10 years old, Columbia controls about 7 percent of the nation's hospitals -- as well as hundreds of related medical operations -- in 38 states, mostly in the Sun Belt. With 285,000 employees, it is the nation's ninth-largest employer, bigger than General Electric, bigger than McDonald's. **********Because of its size, Columbia is Medicare's single largest biller. Reimbursements from the program make up 36 percent of the company's revenue, by far its largest source. **********As Columbia has tried to acquire hospitals across the country, it has often found itself at loggerheads with some state regulators, not-for-profit hospitals and community groups. At the same time, though, it has helped bring a bottom-line sense of efficiency to the hospital industry. Columbia, which has $20 billion in annual revenue, has also become a top-performing health care stock. **********But since the El Paso raid last week, Columbia's stock price has suffered, falling almost 7 percent in the first two days after the investigation was disclosed. Yesterday, the shares closed at $37.50, down 12.5 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********A Federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that investigations of Columbia were going on in cities besides El Paso. From Florida to Texas to Illinois to Nevada, agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been interviewing witnesses about the company's practices. Peter Young, a consultant in Florida who has advised a number of Columbia's not-for-profit competitors, said that Federal agents had gotten in touch with him several times about Columbia's dealings with Medicare and other Federal programs. **********The Billing **********A Propensity For Higher Fees **********The Federal review of Columbia's billing practices began at a small Kentucky hospital, Columbia Spring View Medical Center. **********Responding to queries from The Times about the hospital last year, the Medicare agency reviewed Spring View's records. The agency's review, which focused on billings for four related respiratory illnesses, found that the hospital charged Medicare for the most expensive one far more often than did nearby competitors. And it charged for the least expensive ones far less often. **********Federal officials said the results raised concerns that Spring View might be inflating its Medicare payments through upcoding. **********Medicare pays a fixed rate for treatment of each of roughly 470 coded illnesses. Rates vary sharply -- the more severe the illness, the more Medicare pays. In upcoding, a hospital bills for a more severe illness than the one treated -- and is thus paid more. **********At Spring View, the review found its bills were ''skewed'' toward the highest-paying cases, Mr. Vladeck said: ''The a priori numbers are definitely a source of concern.'' **********In 1995, Spring View billed for treating 191 cases of complex respiratory infection and only 10 cases of the lower-paying pneumonia with complications. By contrast, four nearby hospitals billed more than twice as many cases of pneumonia with complications as of the complex infection -- 263 to 117. At Spring View, Medicare pays roughly $5,700 for treatment of a complex respiratory infection, or about $1,700 more than a case of pneumonia with complications. **********In the wake of those findings, Mr. Vladeck said, the agency opened its wider examination of Columbia hospitals. Mr. Vladeck made his comments over several months, as The Times's investigation evolved. **********To examine Columbia's billing on a larger scale, The Times analyzed records from Florida and Texas -- where Columbia's hospitals are most concentrated -- and found the same pattern as at Spring View. **********The Times's analysis found that in Texas in 1995, the latest year for which data are available, five Columbia general-care hospitals ranked tops for the proportion of cases billed at the highest-paying of the four respiratory codes. In Florida, the top 6 billers, and 7 of the top 10, were Columbia hospitals. **********At Columbia's Cedars Medical Center in Miami, 93 percent of the respiratory cases in the four codes were in the highest-paying category, ranking it fourth in the state. Across the street at the county hospital, Jackson Memorial, only 28 percent of the billings were for that code. **********Cedars billed for 355 cases of complex respiratory infection -- the best-paying diagnosis -- and only 28 cases of the three lower-paying diagnoses. Among the cases studied, it did not bill a single case of the lowest-paying illness, simple pneumonia. At Cedars, Medicare pays roughly $6,800 for a case of complex respiratory infection, and only $3,150 for simple pneumonia. **********Particularly striking was how the billing at Cedars changed after Columbia took over. In 1992, when it last operated independently, 31 percent of the respiratory cases were billed at the highest rate. A year later, 76 percent were, and in 1995, 9 of 10 cases came under the top category. **********When The Times examined more than 100 pairs of Medicare codes that define an illness as simple or complex, it found that, in an aggregate 9 cases out of 10, Columbia hospitals in Florida were more likely than others to choose the more complex -- and more highly paid -- code. The magnitude of the differences varied but over all were found to be statistically significant. **********At Columbia, employees responsible for billing Medicare recalled being presented with lists of ''focus codes'' on which Columbia wanted them to concentrate, each with alternatives that were far more remunerative. In particular, they mentioned several codes later examined by The Times. **********Hospitals across the country try to code as aggressively as possible, to receive the highest reimbursement a patient's symptoms will allow. Before Columbia even came into existence, hospitals were being caught going beyond simply aggressive billing. A series of Federal studies on upcoding, some of which focused on the respiratory codes, concluded that upcoding had cost Medicare hundreds of millions of dollars. **********If upcoding is found, the agency seeks restitution. If a pattern of upcoding is found, the case can be referred for possible prosecution for fraud. Few cases have been prosecuted but Medicare overbilling related to upcoding and other activities has been identified at numerous hospitals and among large numbers of doctors. **********Mark Krushat, who participated in those studies for the Inspector General office that monitors Medicare, called the findings by The Times an initial indicator of a potential problem. But he said that only an analysis of patient charts could confirm violations. **********Mr. Manning of Columbia said that the company's billing is ''in complete adherence to all applicable Federal laws.'' **********The Investing **********Physicians Have Stake In Costly Services **********Since its start, Columbia has invited doctors to invest in the hospitals where they practice. At the same time, it built highly profitable networks of medical services affiliated with the hospitals, offering home care, rehabilitation and the like. **********Now, Government investigators are examining whether those two initiatives might, in combination, violate a law prohibiting doctors from referring patients to facilities in which they invest. **********The 1992 law, written by Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, was intended to curb doctors who might tailor treatments to their personal investments, rather than patient need. Physicians were barred from referring patients to medical businesses like home care agencies if they owned a stake in them. **********But Congress allowed hospital investments, in part because doctors were often the only ones willing to open rural hospitals. **********Columbia relied on the exemption to sell hundreds of doctors stakes in health networks anchored by its hospitals. But those networks also own such services as home care agencies and skilled nursing facilities built around the hospitals. **********Should those services really be considered part of the hospital exemption? Medicare is examining whether Columbia's doctor investors may be violating the law by indirectly profiting from referrals to businesses they cannot otherwise own. **********''To the extent that their physicians have ownership relationships with any of these long-term-care services, I think that raises real legal questions about whether that's allowable behavior under the law,'' Mr. Vladeck said. ''If we have physicians who are referring patients to home-care agencies or skilled nursing facilities in which they have an ownership, that may very well be against the law.'' **********The agency is analyzing whether to issue rules specifically barring physician-investors from referring patients to any outpatient service facilities included in their investment, Government officials said. **********Compounding Medicare's concern is the runaway cost of the services, the fastest-growing piece of the program's budget. **********Last year, a Congressional advisory panel noted that such services consumed almost a quarter of all Medicare payments in 1995, compared with just 9 percent in 1990. **********While it pays a pre-set amount for hospital care no matter how much that treatment actually costs, Medicare uses a far more lucrative method to pay for treatment outside the hospital: it pays an amount based on what the provider says its costs were. **********The Government hoped that payment structure would limit expensive hospitalization. And hospitalization rates have dropped. **********But the structure also led to huge, unanticipated expenses, particularly for services provided after hospitalization. The advisory panel, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, concluded that the system ''encourages the development of new facilities and rewards those that have high cost.'' **********An analysis by The Times of Columbia's business in Texas shows that care provided after hospitalization cost Medicare far more than such services provided by rivals. That was mainly because Columbia patients use the services more often, and at higher cost. **********For example, Medicare's cost from the time of hospitalization until 30 days after the patient was discharged averaged $9,011 at non-Columbia hospitals in Texas. But at Columbia hospitals, that same course of care cost on average 9.5 percent more, or a difference of $855. Alone, the treatment after hospitalization cost Medicare on average nearly 23 percent more, or $667, at Columbia. All figures were adjusted for differences in severity and conditions of illnesses. **********As a result, the course of care for patients treated at Columbia hospitals in 1995 cost Medicare at least $48 million more than if the care had been billed at the state average. **********Columbia patients were sent to skilled-nursing units 27 percent more often than other patients with similar illnesses, the analysis found, and they cost Medicare 44 percent more for such care, or an extra $306 each. Similar outcomes were found for rehabilitation. Columbia used home care at the same rate as its rivals, but home care at Columbia cost more. **********In El Paso, as in other Texas cities, scores of doctors are investors in Columbia medical networks. In that city, the average cost in 1995 for the course of care -- $11,072 -- exceeds the average for the city's non-Columbia hospitals by more than 11 percent. The cost for treatment outside the hospital was 23 percent higher. **********Mr. Manning, the Columbia vice president, said that the company's development of these services demonstrated its commitment to providing a quality continuum of care. One factor in their costs to Medicare, he said, was the program's policy of paying start-up costs for these units in the first few years of their operation. **********''It is not in any patient's interest to be served in an acute-care setting when less-intensive care is more appropriate,'' he said, adding that Medicare encouraged ''hospitals and physicians to deliver care in the most appropriate setting.'' **********A Columbia consultant also noted that large Columbia hospitals with teaching programs -- a modest part of the company's Texas presence -- were somewhat less expensive than other similar hospitals. **********But Mr. Vladeck questioned the value of much of the care provided by these ancillary services throughout the industry. **********''I don't have confidence that the dollars we are spending are buying increased benefits for beneficiaries,'' he said. ''They're buying services, but the extent people are benefiting is really questionable.'' **********The Acquiring **********Accusations of Offers Made to Executives **********Investigators from some agencies now examining Columbia practices in El Paso and elsewhere earlier spent more than a year delving into another key piece of Columbia's business: How it acquires hospitals. **********Agents from the F.B.I., the Internal Revenue Service and the State of Florida worked with Federal prosecutors examining Columbia's acquisition efforts there. **********They found executives who said that as they talked with the company about the sale of hospitals they managed Columbia offered them perquisites and promises of jobs. The agents concluded that such offers might have violated laws against bribes to officials of institutions receiving Federal money. **********''All of these inducements were made by, or on behalf of, Columbia to persons in position of responsibility at hospitals which received millions of dollars in Federal funds and were arguably made for the purpose of affecting the decisions of those persons,'' the agents wrote in a Feb. 26, 1996, memorandum summarizing the inquiry. **********The agents recommended against prosecution, in part because of the small value of the perks offered and also because of concerns about the quality of evidence, which involved conversations difficult to corroborate. But they recommended referring the evidence to 12 state and Federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies. **********The memo summarizing that evidence was distributed to those agencies late last year. A copy was obtained by The Times. **********In it, the agents describe the story of John Geanes, the administrator of South Miami Hospital in Miami. Columbia was one of the hospital's several suitors, and Mr. Geanes played an important role in negotiations. **********The memo says that Mr. Geanes reported that he was first approached by a consultant to South Miami who told him ''that large sums of money were available to people who delivered a hospital to Columbia.'' **********Soon, Dan Moen, president of Columbia's Florida division, approached Mr. Geanes. According to the memorandum, Mr. Moen ''offered to 'protect' Geanes by creating a position for him at Columbia and offered him investment opportunities with Columbia which would make him 'wealthy.' '' **********Shortly after, Mr. Geanes told investigators, he ran into Richard L. Scott, Columbia's chief executive, in a restaurant parking lot. In that encounter, the memo says, Mr. Scott ''inquired of Geanes regarding Geanes' desire to work in North Carolina.'' **********Within days, Mr. Geanes received a call from another Columbia executive offering him a job in that state, the memo says. **********Mr. Geanes immediately informed hospital lawyers of each approach. South Miami was sold to another hospital. Once the hospital ''decided not to sell out to Columbia, the offers to Geanes ceased,'' the memo says. **********Mr. Geanes, who is no longer with the hospital, said he had made his statements under subpoena before a grand jury and refused to comment further. **********Mr. Moen did not return phone calls. Ms. Richardson, the Columbia spokeswoman, declined to comment fully until she researched the events, but she said ''the integrity of this company is impeccable.'' **********Three other hospital officials told law enforcement agents that they or their colleagues had been offered personal benefits or approached about jobs as the company was negotiating to buy their hospitals. **********For example, Joe Kiefer, the chief executive of a hospital in Tarpon Springs, Fla., told investigators that, while negotiating a sale to Columbia, the company offered him a trip to the Super Bowl -- including tickets, travel and hotel accommodations. Mr. Kiefer declined; the negotiations were unsuccessful. **********During the investigation, the agents made oral and written requests for interviews with senior Columbia executives, including Mr. Scott and Mr. Moen. The case was closed months later, the memo says, without any response from the executives. **********How the Analysis of Medicare Costs Was Done **********The study of Medicare costs is based on an analysis of more than 30 million records of Medicare patients who were admitted to hospitals in Texas and Florida in 1995. The New York Times matched records of these patients with bills for hospital readmissions, admissions to rehabilitation and skilled nursing units, outpatient services and doctor bills within 30 days of discharge. **********To account for differences among patients, hospital stays were grouped into 1,500 categories that took into account the type and severity of patient conditions. Costs figures and referral rates were then calculated and adjusted to account for differences in conditions. **********The possibility that differences found in costs or referral rates between Columbia/ HCA hospitals and the typical Texas hospital were due to chance alone is less than 1 in 10,000. Differences remained after taking into account statewide variations in hospital size and wage rates. **********The study included only patients in conventional Medicare programs for the elderly who were admitted to an acute care hospital. It excluded patients admitted for drug or psychiatric treatment, patients transferred to hospitals from nursing homes and other institutions, patients living out of state and patients discharged in the last 30 days of 1995. **********The study did not calculate precisely how much of the post-hospital care was paid to a Columbia/HCA affiliate across Texas. But it examined such payments for referrals to rehabilitation units in two metropolitan areas, Corpus Christi and El Paso, and found that a large proportion went to Columbia facilities. **********To examine differences in medical coding practices for simple and complex respiratory infection and pneumonia, The Times compared groups of related Medicare payment codes using 1995 Medicare records for Florida and Texas. **********JOSH BARBANEL"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/11/business/leap-partnership-gets-2-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-07-11", "snippet": "Chicago and Los Angeles offices of Leap Partnership unit of Leap Group are awarded two accounts with combined billings estimated at $19 million; central region of Daewoo Motor America selects Leap's Chicago office; Los Angeles Department of Water ...", "word_count": 208, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Leap Partnership Gets 2 Accounts", "print_headline": "Leap Partnership Gets 2 Accounts", "body_text": " **********The Chicago and Los Angeles offices of the Leap Partnership unit of the Leap Group were awarded two accounts yesterday with combined billings estimated at $19 million. **********The central region of Daewoo Motor America in Arlington Heights, Ill., part of the South Korean conglomerate Daewoo Group, selected Leap's Chicago office as the first agency to handle its account.

''We are leaving now. See you on earth.'' **********Upon being told that his Soyuz space capsule had successfully cast away from the Mir, Mr. Tsibliyev muttered, ''Thank god.'' **********And as soon as he and the flight engineer, Aleksandr Lazutkin, landed, after a final glitch or two, he flashed a big smile and said, in response to the usual question: ''What other feelings could we have? We are just happy to be back.'' **********The euphoria may fade fast, though, because Mr. Tsibliyev has some explaining to do. He presided over the longest, most serious and most highly publicized string of disasters in the 11-year history of the space station. **********President Boris N. Yeltsin has already set the mood for the return, complaining in an aside on Friday that the Mir was a technical marvel, and that its legion of recent problems was due solely to ''human error.'' That is shorthand for Mr. Tsibliyev, the 43-year-old veteran astronaut who spent seven months on the station in 1993 and six months there this year. **********In June he crashed a supply ship into the part of Mir that supplies much of its electricity, causing the station to lose nearly half its power. While he and his crew circled the globe there was a major fire, serious oxygen failures and several problems with the power supply system. The cooling system failed, and so did the process that turns urine into bath water. **********For a while a delayed supply ship forced the crew to wonder if it would ever be able to discard its own mounting heaps of trash. **********Then, after the crash in June, Mr. Tsibliyev developed stress-induced heart problems that convinced ground controllers he was in no shape to attempt the tricky repairs the station now needs to survive. **********Today Mr. Yeltsin released a statement praising the ''persistence, courage and heroism'' the astronauts showed during their mission. Nobody was fooled. At Mission Control, in the suburbs near Moscow, the deputy fight director, Viktor Blagov, suggested that Mr. Tsibliyev's troubles had just begun. **********''We have found not a single fault in the systems of either Mir or Progress during the collision,'' Mr. Blagov said at a news conference. Progress was the supply ship that rammed into the side of the Spektr science module while Mr. Tsibliyev was guiding it. ''A logical conclusion follows -- technology was not at fault there,'' Mr. Blagov concluded abruptly, implying rather baldly that the fault was Mr. Tsibliyev's. **********The final judgments on the crewmen will probably have to wait until next week, when other astronauts begin to repair the damage. They are  Anatoly Solovyov and Pavel Vinogradov, who arrived on the station Aug. 7, and the American astronaut Michael Foale, who is staying on from the earlier crew. **********First they will try to reconnect the power supply system that has been cut since the accident on June 25. If that succeeds, the team will try to find and repair the hole in the side of the craft. **********If they can fix the problem, then Mir will almost certainly continue  training astronauts to work on a new international space station. But if they fail, then the accident in June will almost certainly have meant the end of the space station, and possibly of Russia's long, vigorous role in manned space flight. **********Even today's getaway appears to have been marred somewhat by the type of minor problems that have come to define Mir. **********The crew landed a little early today and, according to Russian television, that was because Mission Control called a last-minute switch. **********Mr. Tsibliyev and Mr. Lazutkin were supposed to circle the station and photograph the damage before beginning their descent into the atmosphere. **********At the last moment, according to the network, they were told to skip the photo shoot. Why? In 1994, the last time Mr. Tsibliyev left the station, he ran his Soyuz capsule into one of its sides, a minor fender-bender that required no real repair. But at Mission Control today, the nervous leadership decided that their weary commander had had all the flying he needed and it was time to get him home simply and quickly. **********Even the final landing proved faulty. The engines that are supposed to fire and slow the capsule, and soften the impact, failed to work properly. The parachute system performed flawlessly, though, and neither the crew nor the capsule seemed harmed. **********As soon as they landed this afternoon the astronauts were flown by helicopter to a nearby base to undergo preliminary medical examinations. They then traveled by plane to Chkalovsky military air base near Moscow. Late this evening they arrived at the main space training ground, Star City, where they were to be reunited with their families. **********On Saturday the two will face the Russian press, which has devoured  their cosmic mishaps with great eagerness, for the first time. Soon after, if they choose, they will be free to try to forget the whole journey. **********''Sure they will have some effects of the trip and the re-entry,'' said Igor Goncharov, the mission's chief doctor, speaking about the psychological scars of the last six months.

Under certain circumstances, they would also have to adjust their reported profit to reflect changes in the derivatives' value. **********The proposal, which runs some 200 pages and offers dozens of illustrations detailing the ins and outs of the rule, incorporates a number of changes from a preliminary outline offered by the accounting board more than a year ago. **********''The revised proposal reflects most of what we heard from respondents to the exposure draft,'' said Edmund L. Jenkins, the new chairman of the board -- an independent, private-sector group -- who said that it had sought to simplify the accounting and to allow companies greater flexibility. **********The draft will be subject to a 45-day comment period. After that, if the rule is finally approved by the board, it would go into effect at the beginning of 1999. **********The proposal for the complex new accounting treatment puts the F.A.S.B. on the hot seat. The group has been viewed as increasingly vulnerable to pressure from the companies that are affected by its rules. In one embarrassing failure, it was forced to retreat after it proposed requiring companies to treat the stock options they awarded employees as an expense. Protests from business, particularly high-technology companies, culminated in a threat of Congressional intervention. Another event of that sort would be a significant blow to the accounting board's credibility. **********Opposition to the proposed rule is already mounting. In recent weeks, dozens of executives from major financial companies like Bankers Trust, Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Fannie Mae, Keycorp, J. P. Morgan and Goldman, Sachs have expressed concern about the rule's impact and argued that the board should have delayed issuing its proposal. And Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has joined the argument, saying the board should reconsider its position because of companies' serious concerns that the rule ''would not improve the financial reporting of derivatives activities and would constrain prudent risk-management practices.'' **********But the accounting board seems to be marshaling strong support from outside its ranks as well as from the Financial Accounting Foundation, which supports and oversees the group. The foundation's new chairman, who took over Aug. 1, is Manuel H. Johnson, a former Fed vice chairman and co-chairman of Johnson Smick International, an economic consulting firm in Washington. Mr. Johnson was among the new trustees brought in last year when the Securities and Exchange Commission pushed for more public representatives on the foundation's board. **********''F.A.S.B. has not had a good enough network and system of support,'' Mr. Johnson said in a telephone interview before the draft proposal was released. ''It has been left out there isolated.'' **********Although the foundation has no say in the drafting of accounting rules, Mr. Johnson said he believed that the trustees could play a major role in educating their fellow executives and building more support from companies that use financial statements and benefit from the board's rule-making. **********Mr. Johnson's willingness to stand behind the board may be particularly valuable as a counterweight to Mr. Greenspan. ''I think the Fed is an important element,'' said Mr. Johnson, who worked with Mr. Greenspan at the central bank. He said he would try to make sure that the issues raised by the Federal Reserve, which oversees banking regulation, were considered carefully by the accounting board. **********But Mr. Johnson dismissed a notion raised in recent weeks that the board's process had not been sufficiently deliberate and open to comment. **********''No one can accuse F.A.S.B. of dropping a time bomb,'' he said, pointing out that the board had been contemplating the matter of financial instruments for a decade or more. ''This issue has been beaten to death.'' **********The board also has the backing of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''We must not lose sight of the fact that this project grew out of widespread concerns about major derivatives losses that caught investors by surprise in 1994,'' said Michael H. Sutton, chief accountant for the S.E.C., in a prepared statement. ''The F.A.S.B.'s proposal responds to the need for more transparent derivatives accounting.'' Companies like Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings reported substantial losses from their use of derivatives. **********Among the board's other supporters are the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, whose president and chief executive, Barry Melancon, described the issue as ''too complex to be determined according to purely political pressures.'' The Association for Investment Management and Research is also backing the accounting standards board. **********But banks, whose industry is most affected by the new rule, may still take their case to Congress. A letter from a group of 22 executives at major banks and corporations argued that the accounting treatment of derivatives involved crucial issues that ''must be considered, if not by the F.A.S.B., then by the Securities and Exchange Commission, other regulatory agencies or Congress.'' **********Mr. Jenkins expressed dismay at the notion that the development of accounting rules would become a subject of Congressional debate. **********''I would be quite disappointed if this matter comes before Congress,'' he said.

The move has been portrayed as leading to lower prices for phone calls -- a realistic possibility. But if you remember when the United States deregulated telecommunications a year ago, we were promised a lot more than just lower prices. Supposedly, the invisible hand of the marketplace would also build an information superhighway into our homes. Despite the talk from the deregulated utilities, this hasn't happened yet, and it doesn't look as if it will happen anytime soon. **********The twisted paths woven by the three cables coming into our homes -- electricity, telephone and cable television -- are matched only by the pretzel logic advanced by those who celebrate telecommunications  deregulation. When Congress and President Clinton deregulated the communications industry, the program was sold on the premise that competition allowing phone companies to carry television signals, for example,  would spur technical advancement and lower prices. Private investment, the theory  went, would provide all the capital needed for the information superhighway. **********But in a short time, deregulation has degenerated into a game in which the wires never change. Instead of a new fiber-optic cable in every home (carrying voice, data and video), the same old wires are simply being sold under different brand names and  with different pricing. **********The jury is still out on whether deregulation will lower prices, but it is becoming  clearer that no major communications companies plan a true information superhighway. Over the next few years, billions of dollars will be poured into selling new brands of services, but there are no signs that even a dime will be spent to bring a technologically superior cable to your home. **********For example, both AT&T and MCI have plans to offer local phone service on a widespread basis. But are they planning to build a new cable into your home? No. They want to use existing lines from the local telephone companies. **********A few years ago, several Baby Bells teamed up to find a way to deliver digital television over telephone wires, in anticipation of deregulation. Deregulation is here, and now their joint venture, Tele-TV, is  disbanding, saying the technical hurdles are too great. Instead, one of the phone companies, Pacific Telesis, will start offering wireless cable. But this 20-year-old technology, previously known as multichannel multipoint distribution service, or M.M.D.S., offers no advantages over cable or multichannel satellite television services except that it is cheaper to build than running wires into homes or launching a satellite. In New York City, Liberty Cable, a similar wireless cable service offering fewer channels than regular cable television, has operated for years. **********When allowing phone companies into the cable television business was first proposed, didn't everyone expect them to upgrade their phone wires? When competition was proposed for local phone service, wasn't it assumed that there would be new and improved wires to provide this service? By the same logic, cable television companies, now allowed to offer phone service, could enter the local phone market by leasing the existing phone wires from the Baby Bells, thus eliminating any need to upgrade their cable TV wires to handle phone calls. **********Now, electric companies are about to become deregulated. But don't expect any new and improved wires here, either. The plan is to allow similar leasing of existing wires. **********PACIFICORP, a West Coast power company serving 1.4 million customers, announced last month that it would start offering Internet access, long-distance telephone service and cable television. It sounds like a high-technology approach, especially if you have read reports  about how electric companies were developing ways to carry phone calls and other information over their wires. But take another look: Pacificorp has only made deals to resell a potpourri of services -- satellite TV, wireless modem service and long-distance telephone -- from existing providers using the existing wires. The breakthrough is that a single company will bill customers  for all the services. Similar plans for one-stop shopping were recently announced by two other power companies. **********Imagine the possibilities: If you're short of cash one month, instead of choosing between having your telephone or cable TV or electricity cut off, maybe you can lose them all at once. **********The comedian Jerry Seinfeld has defined regifting as giving a gift you've received to someone else. Now, rebranding -- providing an existing service under a new brand name -- has made a joke of telecommunications deregulation. Instead of freeing companies to develop exciting new technologies, it has freed them to develop new marketing plans to sell you services you can already get elsewhere. **********Perhaps the most pathetic example of re-branding is the way AT&T entered the multichannel television business last year to compete with cable television. Is this a new video-over-phone technology? No. AT&T just slaps its logo onto a standard satellite dish. This from the company that tantalized a generation of kids, myself included, with  the Picturephone at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair, and that, in 1984, was forced to divest itself of those very local phone wires they're now trying to lease back in the name of competition in local phone service. **********As a nation, we need to commit ourselves to building a true information superhighway. We need to invest in the communications infrastructure in the way we invested in the transportation infrastructure in the 1950's and 60's, with interstate highways. **********Just as these highways have promoted the free flow of goods, a national information superhighway would promote the free flow of ideas. Rechristening the same old wires and technology under new brand names adds about as much to the advancement of communications as Hershey adds to the future of chocolate by wrapping its Kisses in different wrappers for different holidays. **********Instead of building a bridge to the future,  we're turning our public utilities into ad agencies. So far, deregulation has contributed nothing toward building that bridge, but it's sure helping to build brand awareness."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/13/business/finance-briefs-065358.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Capstone Capital Corp., Birmingham, Ala., is selling $65 million of convertible subordinated debentures due in 2002 through Smith Barney Inc.

Her crime thriller ''All That Remains'' was on the best-seller list and another, ''Cruel and Unusual,'' was on the way. The money was pouring in -- she had made more than $1 million the previous year -- and the actress Demi Moore was talking about starring as Dr. Kay Scarpetta, the medical examiner who is the heroine of Ms. Cornwell's novels, in a movie. **********Not bad for a 37-year-old divorced former reporter who three years earlier had been working in a windowless office in the basement of the Richmond morgue, borrowing money from friends to pay the bills. **********But instead of making merry, Ms. Cornwell sat alone in the living room of a rented beach cottage in Malibu, Calif., on a January afternoon, working on a screenplay for ''Cruel and Unusual'' and polishing off a pitcher of Bloody Marys. She then got into her rented Mercedes-Benz 190 and headed to the trendy Ivy at the Shore restaurant for dinner with her agent, Diane Cairns, and knocked back two glasses of wine. **********Driving home along the Pacific Coast Highway, she rammed the Mercedes into a stalled, empty van, flipped her car over three times. She ended up trapped, bruised and bleeding in the wreckage. A Jaws of Life rescue tool had to be used to pry her free. **********Three years later, the 41-year-old author of six crime best sellers, who made more than $17 million last year, travels New York City in a stretch limousine and appears at book signings with armed bodyguards, says she is glad she had the accident. She now says her personal life was spiraling out of control back then, threatening to ruin her finances as well, and her brush with death came as a wake-up call. **********''It was a necessary experience,'' Ms. Cornwell said in the living room of her rented apartment overlooking Central Park. ''Things were out of control. I was going to live or die. I was going to be bankrupt or I was going to make it.'' **********Running her hands through her streaked blond hair, she added, recalling the accident: ''I remember thinking I wasn't going to go yet. I had to straighten this out.'' **********There was a lot to straighten out -- both in her life and in her finances. Indeed, it is never easy to disentangle the two; when one is a mess, so frequently is the other. And Ms. Cornwell's life reads like a psychologist's checklist of emotional stress and excess: Abandoned by her father as a child and later placed in foster care by her emotionally distraught mother; hospitalized for anorexia as a teen-ager; infatuated with an English professor, whom she pursued in college and married upon graduation; tortured by mood swings throughout her adult life; involved in a messy lesbian love affair with a married F.B.I. agent several years ago, and periodically hooked on the alcohol she drank to calm her nerves. **********On top of that, she had no experience in handling large sums of money. She grew up poor; her professor-husband joined the ministry, and she chose low-paying careers -- first in journalism, then in clerical work. Worst of all, her emotional roller coasters were diagnosed as manic depression, a disorder often marked by episodes of irresponsible behavior and frantic spending. **********Then, almost overnight, Ms. Cornwell hit the big time. ''Postmortem,'' the tale of Kay Scarpetta's hunt for a serial killer, brought both critical praise and five major crime-fiction awards for its gritty realism. In quick order, she pumped out three more novels, ''Body of Evidence,'' ''All That Remains'' and ''Cruel and Unusual,'' similarly grisly tales about Ms. Scarpetta's exploits. Her books might have been made into movies by now, and she would be more of a household name, but for the fact that she insisted on retaining so much control over the projects. **********But Ms. Cornwell was ill-prepared to handle a fortune that now amounts to about $10 million. ''Unless you come from an extraordinary family, what do you have that ever equips you?'' she asked. 'Being a waitress at college certainly doesn't. Being a reporter certainly doesn't. Look at all the successful people and how they destroy themselves and others.'' **********Indeed, though Ms. Cornwell says otherwise, some former associates say financial success brought out the worst in her. Like so many other newly minted celebrities, she had no idea what to do with so much money and, instead of seeking out investment advice, she went on impulsive spending sprees. ''During my manic phases, I would buy a $100,000 Mercedes and drive it away in it, or I would buy $10,000 worth of jewelry,'' she said. One shopping trip resulted in $27,000 worth of furniture. She even hired her Richmond lawyer, Susan Armstrong, to handle her personal affairs at $75 an hour and had her phone lines switched to the law firm so a paralegal could answer her calls. **********And she recalled a nurse, ''sweet as she could be,'' when she had the stitches from the accident taken out. ''She looked at me in my Escada jeans,'' Ms. Cornwell added, referring to the luxury designer label. ''And she said, 'Oh, my God, sweet Jesus, is that Escada you have on?' So I went to the Escada boutique and bought her a $2,000 jacket. That's certainly not a good way to build a financial portfolio.'' **********Her accountant, Brian LaLonde, tried to restrain her, but to no avail. ''I would say, 'You're not getting any royalty checks or advance checks for a while,' '' Mr. LaLonde recalled. '' 'You need to stop spending.' '' **********IF her finances were getting hammered, her personal relationships were getting pulverized. She hired and dismissed members of her research staff with abandon. She had numerous money disputes with underlings, once accusing a former employee, Cynthia Stevens, of failing to return some property to her. (Ms. Stevens countersued Ms. Cornwell, complaining of sexual harassment. Ms. Stevens agreed to return the property and drop her complaint.) And she had a falling-out with an old friend, Dot Jackson, a colleague from her days as a crime reporter at The Charlotte Observer, over the credits to a screenplay on which they had collaborated, as well as over what Ms. Jackson saw as her bullying of employees. ''It was peculiar how many people Patsy thought were greedy, and they weren't greedy in anybody else's view,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''And she bad-mouthed them to everyone. She was a real bully.'' **********Though Ms. Cornwell last week offered to give Ms. Jackson the screenplay rights, Ms. Jackson said the matter was in the hands of her agent. (In the last year, Ms. Jackson has worked as an occasional freelance writer for The New York Times.) **********Ms. Cornwell's celebrity status left her so fearful that others might physically assault her that she began appearing at book signings with bodyguards, moved into a private community in Richmond behind a security gate, slept with a gun at her side, and started to carry firearms, she said, ''wherever it's legal.'' **********In one lengthy 19-point memorandum to her staff, she raised an alarm about a woman who she believed had become ''obsessive'' about trying to meet her. For her protection, she instructed her employees to get permits for concealed weapons, to get firearms training ''if they feel comfortable'' doing so, and to post a security guard at her door when she went to the hospital. She also asked them to use an alias when reserving plane tickets, hotel rooms and restaurant seatings -- ''except for places like Spago, where without my real name I might not get a table,'' according to the memo. **********Though she ordered that the memo be shredded after it was read, a copy was provided to The Times by a former associate. Ms. Cornwell said she did not remember the memo, but conceded that she takes ''any measure I need to for my security.'' **********AS for investing the cash that escaped her shopping binges, Ms. Cornwell didn't have a clue. ''There was more money coming in than I had ever had before,'' she recalled. ''I didn't know anything. My husband had signed all the checks.'' She tried to learn, telling herself, ''Patsy, you're a smart girl; you didn't just fall off a turnip truck,'' but the complexities of portfolio management eluded her. ''I certainly didn't know what a tax shelter was,'' she conceded. **********She invokes her tight working schedule to explain her financial ineptitude. Not only was she churning out books, she was absorbed in the task of building a staff and distracted by personal decisions like whether to buy a house or car. But she acknowledges that she was slow to seek professional assistance. ''I had no business manager,'' she said. ''Nobody was talking to me or telling me how much money I had.'' **********In 1991, she finally decided to seek financial advice from a friend at a Richmond money-management firm. For the first meeting with him, she got a lift to his office  in the morgue station wagon -- with a body rolling around in the back. As a favor, the adviser recommended that Ms. Cornwell put about $45,000 in a mutual fund that ended up earning only about 2 percent a year. **********Why it should take a near-fatal car crash to jar Ms. Cornwell back to reality and start her on the road to financial recovery might seem puzzling to ordinary investors -- the millions of Americans who force themselves to squeeze a few thousand dollars a year from their salaries into their 401(k) plans or other retirement accounts. **********But a look at her troubled life helps explain the riddle. A childhood scarred by separations from both parents led to adult years tormented by an increasing mood instability. By the time sudden wealth showered on her, Ms. Cornwell was simply incapable of responding with the discipline and maturity that any sound investment strategy would require. **********Her father, Sam Daniels, a Miami lawyer, and her mother were divorced when she was 5. She said he left home on Christmas Day to join his secretary, whom he had gotten pregnant. ''I was at that age when little girls worship their daddies,'' she recalled. ''It killed me. It absolutely killed me. I remember him coming out into the hallway. I knew immediately what he was doing. He was never coming back. I ran over crying and screaming and wrapped around one of his legs like a little tree frog and I was screaming 'Don't go! Don't go!' He kind of put me off. He didn't say anything. He just went out the door.'' **********After that, Patsy Daniels rarely saw her father. ''I used to walk to the post office on holidays and my birthday, several times a day, hoping for mail, or gifts,'' she recalled. ''But nothing came.'' **********In 1963, her mother moved the family from Miami to a two-bedroom house in tiny Montreat, N.C. Two years later, nearly broke and close to a breakdown, she left Patsy and her two brothers with neighbors -- the evangelist Billy Graham and his wife Ruth. The Grahams placed the children with Manfred and Lenore Saunders, Christian missionaries who had returned from Africa. **********Ms. Cornwell, who acknowledges having a Gothic imagination, remembers her foster mother with horror. ''That lady would glare at me with reptilian eyes,'' she said. ''She would make me do dishes again and again, six or seven times of washing the same jar. At school she would tell the teachers to watch me cause I was a cheater. **********''I write about fear because I know it better than anything partly because of the incredible fear I had living in that house,'' Ms. Cornwell added. **********AS she does often in recounting unpleasant episodes from her past, Ms. Cornwell paints herself as the victim of a cruel or uncaring adversary. But others do not share that view. Mrs. Saunders, told of Ms. Cornwell's painful memories, chuckled and said, ''I loved that girl, but I was a strict disciplinarian.'' The author's brother John, now a Navy officer, recalls the couple as strict but well intentioned. But Ms. Cornwell is ready with a retort. ''I was a girl,'' she said. ''I got treated differently.'' **********At the age of 18, Patsy Daniels was treated for anorexia for one month at the same hospital, Appalachia Hall, where her mother had been a patient. ''It was like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' '' Ms. Cornwell recalled, referring to the novel and movie featuring a demented nurse who keeps her patients drugged like zombies. ''There were no young people, and everyone was walking around being zapped with shock treatments.'' Ruth Graham, who had befriended young Patsy and remains in close touch with her, confirms that the hospital ''was a really grim place.'' **********She muddled through and went on to Davidson College in Davidson, N.C., graduating not only with honors in English but with a husband, having doggedly pursued Charles Cornwell, an English professor in his late 30's. Her friends say now that the marriage was a disaster from the start and that she constantly derided her spouse. (Ms. Cornwell denies such behavior.) In any case, she soon turned her attention to a career, landing a reporting job at The Charlotte Observer in 1979 and eventually ending up on the police beat. **********When Mr. Cornwell moved to Richmond in 1981 to become a minister, his wife turned to writing books, starting with an authorized biography of Mrs. Graham that caused a temporary rupture in their relationship. By now, Ms. Cornwell had become immersed in the police culture that she covered at her newspaper, and decided to try her hand at crime novels. To learn more about the nitty gritty of police work, she took a job as a computer analyst in the Richmond morgue, spending much of her time with Marcella Fiero, a medical examiner, when she wasn't hanging out with the local police officers. **********Her first three books, based on a male detective, were rejected. Despairing, she asked her agent for advice, and was told she ought to write about her day-to-day experiences in the morgue. So she wrote ''Postmortem,'' her first Scarpetta novel. Though she got an advance of only $6,000, the novel's critical success launched her career. **********Slowly, her books caught on. Income from her writing jumped from almost nothing in 1989 to $560,000 in 1991 and $1.7 million in 1992 as her books reached the best-seller lists. As her fame grew, some former friends say, her obsession with money kept pace. A former associate recalls her as being obsessed with money. ''I can remember during a walk we took,'' this person said. ''She said, 'What do you consider a millionaire: $1 million in the bank or $1 million in assets?' '' **********And Ms. Jackson, her former colleague at the Charlotte newspaper, concurs. ''If you had money, it was good,'' she said. ''If you didn't have money, it was beneath her. In the beginning, she was hyper-intense about her work. But she was not arrogant or selfish or obsessive about money. She got that way when she began to get some.'' **********SIMULTANEOUSLY, Ms. Jackson asserts, Ms. Cornwell assumed an increasingly imperious stance toward employees, often requiring them to sign confidentiality agreements that bound them never to discuss her with former employees or with outsiders. Though Ms. Cornwell asserts that other celebrities do likewise, Ms. Jackson countered: ''I loved her, but I think she began believing her own press releases. I think she thought that if you want to get ahead, this is the way you treat people.'' **********Today, Ms. Cornwell acknowledges that her behavior turned erratic at times under the influence of her undiagnosed manic depression. ''That was not the best time of my life, I would be the first to admit,'' she said. **********But she rejects accusations that she worships money. ''I don't think about money,'' she asserts. **********One disappointment was her failed overtures to Hollywood celebrities. First, she wooed Jodie Foster to play Kay Scarpetta in a film, but Ms. Foster showed no interest. Then she held sporadic and ultimately unpleasant and unsuccessful discussions with Demi Moore to take the same role. **********''Demi made me angry,'' Ms. Cornwell said. ''She demanded to see the script before it was done. She sounded rather threatening on the phone.'' Ms. Moore did not return telephone calls seeking comment. **********For all Ms. Cornwell's fame, the only close and long-lasting relationships she formed were with her fictional protagonists: Kay Scarpetta and Ms. Scarpetta's niece, a lesbian F.B.I. agent. Ms. Cornwell found solace in writing, and came to view her characters almost as flesh-and-blood acquaintances with minds of their own. **********Each time she revisits them, she said, ''I put them on the page and they sit at the table and talk to each other, but I don't really hear them. I can't tell what they're feeling. It's like they're leaving me out and I don't appreciate it. Then I have to say: 'Look, either make me the center of your attention here or I'm going to delete you.'' **********''Sometimes, they just burst to life and next thing you know, I'm into page 200,'' she added. ''It's wonderful. It's like having a relationship.'' **********Even so, her depressions sometimes brought on writer's block. ''My mood would go up and down,'' she recalled. ''I couldn't get it to change. I would go for weeks and I couldn't write because I would get so depressed.'' **********In the fall of 1992, under a psychiatrist's care, she began taking the anti-depressant drug Prozac while at the same time seeking solace in alcohol. **********''I was drinking way too much,'' she said. ''I was going to bars -- gay bars or straight bars. I mean, I didn't care. That was manic behavior.'' **********The drinking and manic behavior continued -- and then came the car crash. **********While the accident didn't transform Ms. Cornwell overnight into a paragon of sweet reason and financial savvy, it started a process of soul-searching that has certainly changed her financial and professional life. **********Late in 1993, she checked into Edgehill Newport, a clinic for recovering alcoholics in Newport, R.I., that has induced her at least to reduce her drinking, she said. And her physician, Erica Blanton, diagnosed her as a manic-depressive and prescribed lithium to suppress the mood swings. **********At first, Ms. Cornwell resisted, but Dr. Blanton calmed her fears. **********''She told me I was bipolar,'' the author said. ''At first I didn't know what she meant -- I thought she was referring to my sex life.'' **********She began taking lithium in the spring of 1994, and she says she believes it has brought some balance to her life, making her a better listener and helping her deal with problems more calmly. ''I am more stable,'' she said. ''My chemistry is more stable. I don't make snap impulsive decisions because my brain is not working right. If I spend $20,000 on art now, I know that I can afford it. It doesn't put me close to the edge.'' **********To make her point, she pulled out a gold pillbox during a recent dinner at Elio's restaurant in New York City, removed a lithium pill and popped it into her mouth. ''I take it everywhere,'' she said. **********One thing she cannot control, however, is the publicity surrounding her romantic entanglements, notably an affair several years ago with the wife of an F.B.I. agent. That liaison came to a messy conclusion when the husband tried to ambush and kill his wife, who was also an agent, in a church basement in Manassas, Va. At his trial, he argued that the affair between his wife and Ms. Cornwell contributed to his mental instability and pushed him toward the crime. He was convicted of attempted murder. **********At first, Ms. Cornwall says, she feared that all the gossip about the incident would provoke a backlash against her and pigeon-hole her as a gay writer. **********''I had no idea what to expect,'' she said. ''Would people burn an effigy in my yard?'' **********She held a book signing with great trepidation, ordering her aides to sweep the bookstore for bombs and to hire ''every security cop we can get our hands on.'' She was relieved to find that news about her personal life had no effect on her book sales. **********She believes that her medication, as well as her experience, have made a difference in her work, too. She hired an office manager, Chris Bailor, a former Richmond policewoman, and the once-brisk turnover among her staff of seven women has slowed. **********Certainly Ms. Cornwell is more prolific than ever. The lithium ''has made my writing better,'' she said. **********Critics disagree. ''Hornet's Nest,'' her first novel without Dr. Scarpetta, is currently No. 4 on the New York Times best-seller list, where it has appeared for eight weeks. The Times's critic called the book ''exceedingly dull.'' A critic for Entertainment Weekly described the book as ''a mess.'' A review in The Daily News called it a book in ''the throes of an identity crisis.'' **********STILL, Ms. Cornwell says she can now concentrate better on her writing. Before, ''I would work. Then I'd get up,'' she said. ''Then I'd work, and I'd leave the house to do an errand. I'd do anything not to sit still.'' **********Lithium changed that, she said. ''I wrote 220 pages of 'Cause of Death' in 10 days'' back in 1995, she boasted. And, ''I didn't drink a pitcher of Bloody Marys afterward.'' **********But in fact, she has not sworn off alcohol, she acknowledged. ''I had to go out and drink tequila after that to try and knock myself out so I could sleep,'' she said, speaking at a rapid clip that suggests her moods can still be intense. 'But I didn't drink a pitcher of Bloody Marys and I didn't drive.'' **********Besides moderating her drinking, she is raking in the money. With four more novels reached the best-seller lists both in the United States and abroad, she earned $4.5 million in 1994, $7.4 million in 1995 and $17 million last year. **********Though Ms. Cornwell is not as widely known as Danielle Steele, Michael Crichton, Tom Clancy, John Grisham or Mary Higgins Clark, whose blockbuster books have become films or television movies, she too belongs to the club of a dozen or so authors who command multimillion-dollar advances. For United States rights to her next three books, Putnam has paid her $24 million, which she will collect as she delivers the manuscripts. **********Moreover, she now considers herself much more firmly in control of her money than ever. At the suggestion of her lawyer, Michael Rudell, a partner at Franklin, Weinrib, Rudell & Vassallo, a New York firm that specializes in the entertainment industry, she recently hired Stanley Gillman, a partner at the accounting firm of Yohalem Gillman & Company, as her financial consultant. **********Mr. Gillman's job is to advise her how to deploy a $5 million portfolio that is currently concentrated in blue-chip stocks. ''We are trying to help her find a good investment house,'' Mr. Gillman said, ticking off well-known Wall Street firms like Neuberger Berman, First Manhattan and Sanford C. Bernstein. Ms. Cornwell said her goals were quite conservative and acknowledged that she had none of the fascination with investing that characterizes her obsession with crime. ''If I were to sit down and spend all my time talking to lawyers and accountants, I would never write books,'' she said. ''I don't pretend to be a business person. I am just a person who has business who is an artist.'' **********In addition to her $5 million in liquid assets, Ms. Cornwell has an almost equal amount in property. She owns an office building, a home and land in Richmond valued altogether at roughly $3 million. She has condominiums in the Cayman Islands and in Hilton Head, S.C., worth about $2 million together. On top of that, she has put about $1 million into a charitable foundation. **********If she is more cautious about wasting money on cars and clothes and other consumer goods, Ms. Cornwell does not stint on paying big money to do research for her books, especially if that means flying off to far-away locales to capture the color of places she writes about or maintaining a permanent staff to help with her with research and travel arrangements. When she decided that the serial killer in ''From Potter's Field'' had to come from a pecan plantation, for example, her staff found a pecan plantation in South Carolina. She flew there immediately. **********As she was finishing her next book, ''Unnatural Exposure,'' last year, she said, ''I realized that Scarpetta had to go to London, and she had to go to Victoria Station.'' She flew there, too -- on the Concorde, at her own expense. **********''I want to go to strange places and I want to get there fast,'' she said. ''Read my books. There is an energy and an authenticity.'' **********Still, Ms. Cornwell allows her enthusiasms to be tempered by her financial overseers. When she suddenly decided she wanted to buy her own jet, for example, Mr. Gillman persuaded her to hold off. ''Let's get some information on the flying that you do first,'' he told her. ''Then you can decide if you should buy a jet, lease one or time-share it.'' **********Mr. Gillman also talked her out of paying cash for a $1 million office building that she bought in Richmond and into taking a 15-year, $700,000 mortgage instead. ''We felt she could make better use of the money than putting it into the building,'' he said. **********Aware of her history of impulsive buying, he has also tried to scold her out of repeating her past mistakes. ''I don't want you buying any more property. I know that's hard because I know how much you like to buy motorcycles or planes or whatever,'' Ms. Cornwell recalled. **********One area about which she is unlikely to listen to outside advice is her security. Ms. Cornwell never shows up at book signings without bodyguards. The security at her home is extensive and her driver is a former police officer. On a recent trip to Ireland, Finland and England to promote ''Hornet's Nest,'' she took several staff members and posted guards at book signings there, too. **********Ms. Cornwell, who estimates that she has attended some 600 autopsies, said the experience would make anyone ''intelligently cautious.'' ''You can't see all that and have the same view of how safe the world is,'' she said. ''When women come in and they have had their throats dismembered or been raped or men have been stabbed 120 times, you're never the same. You go home and you worry about things that other people don't. For me, it is compounded by being well-known and people are aware of you.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/24/business/economic-calender.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Calender", "print_headline": "Economic Calender", "body_text": " **********Expected dates for the release of major economic indicators this week. **********MONDAY **********None **********TUESDAY **********Consumer Confidence Feb. **********WEDNESDAY **********None **********THURSDAY **********Durable-Goods Orders Jan. **********Existing-Home Sales Jan. **********Weekly Jobless Claims **********FRIDAY **********G.D.P.

That compares with net income of $144 million, or 9 cents, in the period a year earlier, after a charge of $376 million, or 23 cents a share, related to the company's restructuring its international beverage business, and profit from discontinued operations of $134 million, or 8 cents. **********The spinoff of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell is part of the plan of the company's chairman, Roger Enrico, to shed cash-hungry businesses and better compete against Coca-Cola. **********Despite the strong earnings, Pepsico's shares fell $1.5625, to $38.4375, after hitting a 52-week high of $40.6875 early in the day. **********Analysts said the stock fell amid concern over a 2 percent drop in Pepsi's domestic beverage profits and because several analysts cut fourth-quarter earnings forecasts. **********''The U.S. beverage results were disappointing,'' said Caroline Levy,  of Schroder & Company, who upgraded Pepsi to ''outperform significantly'' on Monday.

It was the first growth for Pepsi's international beverage business in a year. The international beverage division reported an operating profit of $75 million. Pepsi is restructuring its international bottling business and recently signed an agreement for Suntory to be its primary bottler in Japan. **********''The one question mark in the whole Pepsi story has been international beverages,'' said a Prudential Securities analyst, George Thompson.

Pepsico's international profits offset a 2 percent decline, to $425 million, in operating profits in North America in the quarter. Pepsi said soft-drink prices remained competitive for most of the quarter, improving sales but lowering profits. **********In the United States, Pepsi said that almost all its bottlers had signed new contracts, freeing it to pursue fountain accounts from restaurants.

Havas, meanwhile, was reported to be shopping for a bigger stake in Canal Plus SA, Europe's biggest pay-TV service. **********It appeared to be the start of another round of musical chairs involving many of the top players in French industry, finance and media.

Alcatel confirmed that it was in discussions with privately owned Dassault and state-owned Aerospatiale about the Thomson takeover. **********But neither Dassault nor Aerospatiale, which are set to merge in 1997, would comment. **********At current market prices, the 58 percent of Thomson-CSF that the government wants to sell would cost about 11 billion francs ($2 billion). Thomson-CSF shares rose 4.60 francs to close at 169. **********Generale des Eaux, which has broad interests in public services, transport, media and other fields, would become one of the biggest players in the European media with a majority stake in Havas. The two companies said discussions were \"in progress concerning their respective interests in audiovisual activities.\" **********In expanding its stake in Canal Plus, Havas would become more directly involved with media competitors such as Rupert Murdoch of News Corp. instead of being a holding company for a multiplicity of publishing and broadcasting interests.

S. Barrington's, a lobster and pasta restaurant on the corner of East 54th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan. **********Marisa Baridis, 29, and Jeffrey L. Streich, 31, who both worked in the securities industry, had become acquainted on summer weekends in the Hamptons. **********But they were from opposite ends of Wall Street: Ms. Baridis was a legal compliance officer at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, perhaps the most blue-blooded giant in the securities industry, while Mr. Streich was a struggling broker who had worked at a succession of smaller firms -- D. H. Blair, A. S. Goldmen and Gruntal Financial -- that specialize in speculative stocks. And during the summer, market regulators barred Mr. Streich from the industry, citing several violations of securities laws. **********Seated in front of the full-length window last month, the two seemed like just another attractive young couple out on a date. But this was not just any date. Mr. Streich was paying Ms. Baridis for sensitive inside stock information that she knew he would profit from, a lawyer involved in the case said. She was nervous, telling him she could go to jail. He swore ''on his mother's ashes'' that he would be careful with how he used the information. **********At Morgan Stanley, Ms. Baridis was in charge of maintaining a ''Chinese wall'' to avoid conflicts about privileged information within the firm. She had acquired a wealth of information about planned mergers and reorganizations of her firm's clients. But that weekend, instead of safeguarding that information, as she was legally bound to do, Ms. Baridis was selling it to Mr. Streich for $2,500 in hundred-dollar bills, something she had reputedly done several times before. **********What Ms. Baridis did not know was that Mr. Streich wore a hidden recording device that caught every word of their conversation. And they were sitting by the window so they could be caught on camera by an undercover crew working for the Manhattan District Attorney's office. **********The two even talked about their fears of being caught, comparing themselves to Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, who pleaded guilty to securities felonies in the 1980's. **********The next week, on Monday, Nov. 3, detectives from the District Attorney's office appeared at Morgan Stanley's new offices off Times Square and took Ms. Baridis in for questioning. Later that week, she was charged with insider trading. **********Ms. Baridis was arraigned the next day in New York City Criminal Court and charged with grand larceny, possession of stolen property, scheming to defraud, accepting a bribe and securities fraud. Ms. Baridis's father, Anestis, who owns a bridge-painting company in Pennsylvania, met her $250,000 bail, securing it partly with his house. **********Yesterday, Ms. Baridis was arraigned again and indicted on new charges of grand larceny, conspiracy and bribery. The indictment also charged Robert Breed, 29, a broker at First United Equities; Howard Boyar, 34, a broker at GKN Securities, who resigned Nov. 12, and Vincent M. Napolitano, 29, who the authorities say ran a securities business out of an East Side apartment. They face charges including conspiracy, possession of stolen property, securities fraud and bribery. From the summer of 1996 through this month, the indictment said, they all traded on information provided by Ms. Baridis ''to make hundreds of thousands of dollars'' and conspired ''to steal more than $1 million through insider trading.'' Ms. Baridis made about $70,000, according to prosecutors. **********During this time, the District Attorney's office said yesterday, the defendants used confidential information from Morgan Stanley relating to 13 companies: Healthcare Imaging Services, Owen Healthcare, Starsight Telecast, Ontrak Systems, Square Industries, American Medical Response, Ocean Energy I, Georgia Pacific, Reading & Bates, Coram Healthcare, Doubletree, Rohr and Einstein Bagels. **********Mr. Breed and Mr. Boyar, who live on the Upper East Side, had both worked at D. H. Blair, where Mr. Streich started out. They had later gone on to work at A. R. Baron, a brokerage firm that was itself indicted earlier this year, along with 11 of its brokers and former executives, and has since closed. **********''When all the facts are in, I am confident that Ms. Baridis will not be the villain of the piece,'' said Paul Shechtman, a lawyer for Ms. Baridis at Stillman & Friedman, a New York law firm. ''Jeff Streich is a person who has difficulty telling the truth. What I have come to find is that when he prefaced a statement to Marisa with 'I swear on my mother's ashes,' it was a giveaway that he was about to lie.'' **********Matthew Brief, Mr. Streich's lawyer, did not return repeated telephone calls yesterday. Ron Rubinstein, Mr. Napolitano's lawyer, said his client had pleaded not guilty and had posted bail. John F. Triggs, Mr. Boyar's lawyer, also said his client had pleaded not guilty and posted bail, as did Michael Kalmus, a lawyer for Mr. Breed. **********Mr. Streich has gone underground; messages left with his father, a family friend and a former colleague elicited no response. ''No, he does not live here,'' said a woman who answered the telephone at a Manhattan number where his father said he might be reached. **********Mr. Streich's four-year securities career was apparently over after he was barred permanently in July and fined $50,000 for unauthorized trading in customers' accounts. Mr. Streich then somehow found himself ensnared in a growing investigation of A. R. Baron, a brokerage firm where several of his former Blair colleagues worked. That is what may have made him so eager to assist the District Attorney's office in its snaring of Ms. Baridis and the others. In yesterday's indictment, Mr. Streich was referred to as ''John Doe, a conspirator,'' and a prosecutor declined to confirm his role in the case. **********The fall for Ms. Baridis has been swift and sudden. Just a month ago, with her job at Morgan Stanley, four years' experience at Smith Barney and a law degree from Touro College, Ms. Baridis had bright prospects. When she was not working, Ms. Baridis liked to go to bars and party with her friends before retiring to her apartment at the Wellesley, an upscale building on East 72nd Street. **********In her career on Wall Street, Ms. Baridis would also have garnered an annual bonus that would lift her salary, which was more than $70,000 a year at Morgan Stanley. A little extra financial help from home meant that even with a $2,400 rent, Ms. Baridis could live relatively well. **********Prosecutors are now trying to freeze Ms. Baridis's assets and are seeking a forfeiture of $100,000 from her. Smith Barney has said that it is cooperating with the authorities. **********Jeanmarie McFadden, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley, said yesterday: ''After reviewing the grand jury indictment, we have terminated Marisa Baridis's employment with the firm, effective immediately. We will continue to cooperate fully with the District Attorney in this matter.''  Ms. Baridis had been on unpaid leave since her original indictment. **********Mr. Streich's descent was more gradual. A graduate of community college and the State University of New York at Brockport, he began his brokerage career in June 1991 at D. H. Blair, which just this year paid more than $4 million to settle a case with regulators related to overcharging and other infractions. He seemed to have found his niche, telling his father and friends that he had passed his broker's exams on his first try ''with flying colors.'' **********After a short spell at another New York brokerage, A. S. Goldmen & Company, in the late summer and fall of 1993, Mr. Streich moved to Gruntal for a few months before starting at Beacon Securities in March 1994. That firm never got off the ground, however, and Mr. Streich left in August 1995. **********Mr. Streich even persuaded Faith Merlob, a friend of his late mother, to invest $10,000 of her money in Beacon Securities, money that she lost, she said earlier this week. She does not blame Mr. Streich, she said, adding that he had called her recently to say that she might soon see a newspaper article ''about him being an informant.'' **********''Somebody has got to do something with all these brokerages,'' said Ms. Merlob, who said she did not blame Mr. Streich for her loss. ''He's really a nice person, he really is.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/27/world/china-press-now-lacks-tea-leaves.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1997-02-27", "snippet": "Beijing's major newspapers carry front pages with identical layouts of Deng Xiaoping's funeral; newspapers have given extensive coverage to Deng's death, but there have been few articles about China's political transition; photo (M)", "word_count": 715, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Press Now Lacks Tea Leaves", "print_headline": "China Press Now Lacks Tea Leaves", "body_text": " **********On Red Star Lane, a narrow alleyway in downtown Beijing where tiny stalls compete for space to sell fruit, comic books, socks and newspapers, it was the newspapers that sold swiftly this afternoon. **********It did not really matter which newspaper a customer picked, because they all looked exactly the same. Beijing's major newspapers -- People's Daily, Beijing Daily, Guangming Daily, People's Liberation Daily -- all carried front pages with an identical layout, photographs and headline: ''Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Funeral Solemnly Held in Beijing.'' **********In a period of political transition, after Mr. Deng's death last week at 92, China's news outlets are the first place to look for a hint that a real change is under way, or that someone is challenging the new leadership headed by President Jiang Zemin. **********But today, the pages of China's major newspapers looked deadly dull, with the same full text of President Jiang's eulogy, itself a dry account of Mr. Deng's life and contributions that lacked any sign of initiative or rhetorical flourish. For a reader, not much to go on. **********In fact, with China changing so rapidly in business and society, it is striking how torpid and old-fashioned the news outlets remain, and it is even more striking on a big news day. The more modern China becomes each year, the more its official coverage of political events stands out for seeming to be stuck in another time. **********Given such a listless rendering of the day's news, what may be most surprising is that many newspapers sold at all. But Chinese newspaper readers, from years of practice, expect to look for subtle indications of political shifting, not for an accurate rendering of the day's events. **********So today's news of Mr. Deng's funeral, full of symbolism if not content, was something to feed on. The day's newspapers sold far faster than usual on Red Star Lane. **********''I want to read the speech,'' said Sun Yaping, a Government employee, referring to the way he will scour it for subtle references. ''This is an important time to read carefully.'' **********Wang Yanli, a retired man who wandered down the lane from his home to buy the afternoon paper, said: ''I'm getting old and don't care so much about politics. But I want to see how it looks today.'' **********Oddly, it is precisely at times of national crisis in China when journalists are least busy, rather than the reverse. With a large and sensitive news story at hand, a Chinese editor explained, the writing and layout are dictated entirely by the authorities at the Propaganda Department, with little room for much else. **********''They give us the material and put it in,'' said the editor, who insisted on anonymity. ''This week has been the most relaxed we've been in years.'' **********Wu Guoguang, a former editor at People's Daily who now teaches at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, pointed out that Chinese newspapers had progressed in small ways in the last 10 years, covering crime and international news that was simply omitted in the past. **********''In the political realm, you really have no chance of seeing anything in the newspapers,'' Mr. Wu said. ''If we have a serious power struggle, it is more likely to be reported in a debate over economic policy.'' **********Mr. Wu added that with the wheels of change turning slowly in China's top leadership, he did not expect to see any sign of serious debate in the Chinese news media for about six months. **********Virtually all newspapers in China are Government-controlled, and editors at the large ones take guidance daily from the Propaganda Department, now run by Ding Guangen. He has coordinated a political campaign in the last year to make sure that China's press, films and television are tightly supervised. **********Ever since the Communist Party took power in 1949, China's media have been used to carry out political campaigns. That situation reached an extreme at the height of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, when People's Daily reflected the fanatical attitude of the day with the headline: ''There Is Chaos Under Heaven -- the Situation Is Excellent.'' **********A glaring exception to state control over the news media came in 1989, when student demonstrations paralyzed the party's leadership and won the sympathy of newspaper editors.

Otherwise, only coercion can achieve the Taliban goal, Mr. Arlacchi said, and that would backfire. **********Still, Mr. Arlacchi was beaming after his three hours of negotiations with the Taliban, which began almost immediately when he arrived from Europe on Sunday. **********He was particularly exultant about a promise from the Taliban to allow women to work in a textile factory on the edge of town, which the United Nations will help rehabilitate. The extent of this commitment is not clear. But if it is fulfilled, it will be something of a breakthrough in the Taliban's treatment of women. **********Reopening the factory is part of a pilot poppy eradication project, which should lead to Kandahar Province being poppy-free within a year, Mr. Arlacchi said. **********During the negotiations, the Taliban also agreed to destroy all new poppy fields in this southern province, to destroy any heroin laboratories in the country and to allow United Nations officials complete access to all areas to insure compliance. **********But the path to a poppy-free Afghanistan is fraught with potential perils, not the least of which is the nature of the Taliban Government. **********''It is not recognized, and it is not credible,'' said a senior United Nations official who advised Mr. Arlacchi before the negotiations. ''Whatever they agree to, how long it will last, it's a relative matter.'' **********The Taliban, who began their march to power three years ago, now control about three-quarters of Afghanistan, including just about all of the poppy-growing regions. **********Only three countries have recognized the Taliban as the Afghan Government: Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. On her recent visit to an Afghan refugee camp in Pakistan, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright described the Taliban's treatment of women and children as ''despicable.'' Women are not allowed to work and must be fully covered when outdoors, and girls are barred from going to school. **********Mr. Arlacchi said he thought that the Taliban had embarked on a poppy eradication program in an effort to overcome their negative image in the world. ''I told them: 'Your image is bad. Nobody likes you. You are isolated.' '' Mr. Arlacchi said. ''I told them bluntly, 'You have two problems -- drugs and women.' '' **********He said he believed that the Taliban would deliver on their commitment, noting that they had virtually eliminated the use of hashish, long common here. And with their dictatorial powers, the Taliban have also successfully put many other Draconian measures into effect. **********Taliban officials said their commitment to eradicate poppy came from the Koran, which forbids the use of drugs, the Governor of Kandahar Province, Mohammed Hassan, said after meeting Mr. Arlacchi. **********''Because we are Muslims, we are against any kind of business with drugs,'' Mr. Hassan said. **********In exchange for the commitment to eradicate poppy cultivation, the Taliban want help from the United Nations in rebuilding the country, which has been devasted by nearly 20 years of war. Irrigation canals and roads must be repaired, and farmers desperately need seed and fertilizer. **********As a start, the United Nations will help get the textile factory 10 miles outside town operating again. **********The factory will provide jobs for 1,400, the plant manager, Mohammed Nausadi, 61, said as led a tour of the darkened plant on Sunday evening. Built by the West Germans in the 1970's, the plant has the capacity to produce 500 tons of yarn a year for carpet weaving, and a million yards of cloth for shawls, he said, animated by the thought of the machines soon humming again. **********When the factory was fully operating, it employed 53 women, Mr. Nausadi said. The small number is a reflection of the fact that even before the Taliban, women did not fare well in rural Afghanistan, where donkey-drawn carts move along dusty roads and villagers live in sand-colored hovels made of thick mud. **********Mr. Arlacchi said he hoped that about 200 women would be employed when the factory was fully operational again. **********But Governor Hassan said only that there had been an agreement ''in principle'' that women could work there. ''Let's see the condition of the factory,'' he said. ''Then the decision will be taken on how many.'' **********In keeping with Islamic principles, men and women will not be allowed to work in the same area, he said. That will require walls to be built. There will also be a separate entrance for women. **********With few factory jobs, farmers will be weaned away from poppy cultivation only if they can earn more from other crops, United Nations and Taliban officials agree. **********That may not be so easy. **********On the outskirts of town, hard against a rock outcropping, Wali Mohammed sold about 65 pounds of poppy seed last season. Buyers came from all over, he said, with a smile, and he was paid the equivalent of some $700. **********''It was a lot of money for me,'' said the 66-year-old peasant, who has 11 children. Today, he was working with a small knife around the onions and radishes he has planted. From these he will earn $200, he said. **********''After the vegetable season, I will grow poppy again,'' he said. **********Another farmer, Haji Ehsanullah, said he, too, was prepared to grow poppies this season. But he might forgo doing so. **********''If I get assistance from the Government, I will stop,'' said Mr. Ehsanullah, 45, the father of 10."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/08/world/un-yields-to-congo-on-massacre-investigation.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1997-07-08", "snippet": "United Nations Sec Gen Kofi Anan gives in to demand by Pres Laurent Kabila of Congo that UN replace international team of experts selected to investigate allegations of massacres of Hutu refugees from Rwanda; Kabila has objected to presence of Chi...", "word_count": 501, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

It is now likely to be postponed for some time, raising concerns that evidence can be removed or destroyed in the interim. **********The Kabila Government, which as a rebel movement ousted President Mobutu Sese Seko in May, has said that any killings were carried out by renegade troops, not as a matter of policy. The Government has also asked for 10 days' notice of the names of the new investigators and is insisting on other concessions. **********The decision to send a team more to Mr. Kabila's liking has distressed officials within the United Nations, who believe that at least 200,000 Rwandan Hutu once in eastern Congo, the former Zaire, are still unaccounted for. It has also led to sharp criticism from human rights groups. **********''This is a disastrous precedent,'' said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who said that government leaders have not been accommodated this way in the past. ''Look at Cuba, Sudan, Iran, Iraq -- there are plenty of countries who have refused access,'' Mr. Roth said. ''In each case the United Nations has said: 'Look, this is who we appointed. You either let him in or suffer the consequences of becoming an international pariah.' '' **********Mr. Kabila has objected to the presence on the team of Roberto Garreton, a Chilean human rights lawyer. In April, Mr. Garreton said he had enough evidence of massacres to warrant a full investigation.  The 53-member United Nations Human Rights Commission then asked him to lead a team to eastern Congo, where reports of massacres are still accumulating. An advance party of negotiators spent more than a week in Kinshasa trying to reach an agreement with Mr. Kabila's Government. When that failed, the United Nations Human Rights Center in Geneva turned the matter over to Mr. Annan. **********At the State Department today, the spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said the Administration supported Mr. Annan's decision to take over responsibility for the Congo investigation. Mr. Burns also backed the Congo Government's request that the investigation should cover not only the reported deaths of Hutu, but also of Tutsi in what was then eastern Zaire since March 1993. **********In Geneva, Mr. Annan said on Thursday that ''the most important thing is for us to get the facts.'' **********''The alleged mass killings ought to be investigated, and we will do whatever we can to investigate them,'' the Secretary General said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/11/business/prices-steady-to-lower-on-treasuries.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1997-04-11", "snippet": "Prices of US Treasury securities are slightly lower to unchanged; 30-year bond slips 2/32, to price of 94 3/32 to yield 7.10 percent, unchanged from April 9 (M)", "word_count": 503, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prices Steady To Lower on Treasuries", "print_headline": "Prices Steady To Lower on Treasuries", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities were slightly lower to unchanged yesterday, as investors sold on the fear that forthcoming data would point to stronger inflation and keep the Fed in a restrictive mode. **********The 30-year bond slipped 2/32, to a price of 94 3/32 to yield 7.10 percent, unchanged from Wednesday. **********Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said: ''There have been few statistical releases for the bond market to digest thus far this week, and as a result activity has been rather lackluster.

But tomorrow morning, March statistics for both the Producer Price Index and retail sales are to be released, ''and the markets will be anxiously awaiting these statistics,'' he added. **********Mr. Fine said that even if the price index was favorable, it might not prove too helpful to the bond market, as the Fed is looking beyond the current inflation environment toward future price increases in determining monetary policy. **********''As a result,'' Mr. Fine said, ''the retail sales number takes on even more importance, particularly in light of Chairman Greenspan's comment that future spending is the key to economic outlook. Needless to say, retail sales in both January and February forged ahead rather strongly, and while spending in March is expected to have slowed somewhat from this overly rapid pace despite a boost from the Easter holiday at the end of the month, it is highly unlikely to deter the Fed from further tightening. **********''Indeed, until there is a definitive slowdown in the pace of economic growth, the bond market will continue to anticipate the next Fed move toward a less accommodative monetary policy.''

But today the technology known as R.D.S. -- for Radio Data Systems -- seems destined to join the eight-track tape and the Betamax videocassette recorder as a flop in the United States. **********''Smart'' radios arrived on American shores five years ago with impressive potential. They could tune stations by format rather than frequency and interrupt a cassette or compact disk -- or regular programming -- when they had something important to transmit about the weather or the traffic. They could even be equipped to print out information transmitted by the station. **********Adding to the prospects for success in America was the technology's encouraging record of consumer acceptance in Europe and East Asia. R.D.S.'s liquid-crystal displays of text could be placed on car, portable and home radios. **********Yet, despite a strong push by the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association and some of its members -- both of which furnished the needed hardware free to big radio stations in an effort to jumpstart R.D.S. -- the technology arrived here stillborn. Today, there is a growing sense among radio broadcasters and manufacturers that the breakthrough may never happen. **********''I don't see or hear much about it,'' said Ed Schwartz, the head of engineering for New York's WCBS-AM and WCBS-FM. **********The manager of a Duluth, Minn.,  FM station had never seen his own station's R.D.S. display until Bruce Elving, the publisher of FM Atlas, showed it to him. ''I guess that tells you something about the success of the medium,'' Mr. Elving said. **********James Stevens, product manager for radios at Blaupunkt, a pioneer in European R.D.S. since its start in 1985, called the situation in the United States ''a classic chicken-and-egg situation.'' Only several hundred commercial FM stations, of a total of 5,468, use the technology. This, along with the limited number of R.D.S. radios, falls well short of the critical mass needed. **********Experts on the technology react to the somber prognosis with regrets.  Mr. Elving regards the episode as a missed opportunity for broadcasters. He sees R.D.S. as ''an excellent promotional tool'' since call letters and format are flashed continuously on a liquid-crystal display. **********A radio that can print can also provide such information as song titles and artists without waiting for the disk jockey to do so. In Houston, KTBZ-FM has shown the potential of R.D.S. by transmitting such data to roadside electronic billboards. **********As originally conceived, an R.D.S. radio could be fitted with small printers similar to those that issue taxi receipts. These could contain information like titles, artists and where a CD could be purchased. Or a listener could hear a commercial while the radio printed a discount coupon. **********As engaging as all this might sound, it does not hint at what may be the single greatest utility of R.D.S.: its role as an aid to improved traffic-flow management. That is the case in Europe, where R.D.S.-equipped receivers are common in expensive automobiles, and public transportation officials have seized upon this technology. **********For an American motoring along the Autobahn, it can be unnerving at first to hear the music suddenly give way to an announcement about an accident ahead. In that setting, ''you get pretty quickly sold'' on the benefits of R.D.S., according to Eric Braun, vice president for new technology at the consulting firm of Frank N. Magid Associates. **********This same technology could also be used with an accessory buzzer to alert listeners to breaking news they might otherwise miss. **********With such an array of applications, how could R.D.S. miss? **********Experts cite a variety of reasons. For one thing, they say, the American version puts too great an emphasis on the printed identification of call letters and format to the exclusion of other features. They also blame poor promotion for the low consumer awareness. **********Most pointedly, the experts cite the reluctance of broadcasters to try anything that might remotely threaten the loss of their audience, even if only for a short interval. **********''I want my listeners to stay with my station,'' said one broadcaster who insisted on not being identified.  ''I don't want to give them reasons or give them technology that will enable them to suddenly tune out, automatically or otherwise.'' **********Also holding back R.D.S. in America is the fact that some of its selling points address needs peculiar to the European market. For example, the ability of the car radio to switch automatically from one network affiliate to another with a stronger signal is useful only for a network-based system of broadcasting. In the United States, commercial FM radio is devoted primarily to locally originated fare. **********Moreover, since the R.D.S. signal rides on an FM subcarrier, AM stations are effectively shut out. That is not a problem for Europe where news and information programming is in generous supply on FM. But in this country, most news and talk stations are AM. **********Mr. Elving has not given up all hope. Perhaps, he said, the analogy of color TV -- which took more than a decade to win consumer acceptance -- applies. But unless R.D.S. can be ''resuscitated,'' he warned, it will follow the path of Dolby FM, which, he recalled, ''went the way of the dinosaur.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/17/business/data-general-comeback-built-on-cost-cutting-and-innovation.html": {"writer_name": "Glenn Rifkin", "pub_date": "1997-03-17", "snippet": "Data General Corp, troubled minicomputer giant, is making comeback, fueled by sales of two new machines and fanatical commitment to cost-cutting; chief executive Ronald L Skates's turnaround strategy gets credit; photo (M)", "word_count": 1316, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Data General Comeback Built on Cost-Cutting and Innovation", "print_headline": "Data General Comeback Built on Cost-Cutting and Innovation", "body_text": " **********After a decade of losses totaling more than half a billion dollars, the layoffs of more than 13,000 of the company's 18,000 workers and a close brush with bankruptcy, Data General's executives feel like survivors of an ugly train wreck. No one is quite ready to declare victory and celebrate. **********But after being written off as dead in the unforgiving world of high technology, the former high-flying minicomputer giant, a company whose brash and aggressive style was chronicled in Tracy Kidder's Pulitzer Prize-winning book ''The Soul of a New Machine,'' has turned around. **********The comeback effort has been fueled by the sales, if not souls, of two new machines and a fanatical commitment to cost-cutting. **********Always respected for its technological prowess, the Data General Corporation has been able to rebound because of two crucial product lines -- a high-end server called Aviion that is intended to accommodate the data processing needs of an entire corporation and a disk storage system called Clariion. Revenue growth was 10 percent in 1995, and 15 percent in 1996, when revenues from products -- as opposed to services -- grew by 22 percent. **********Wall Street has noticed. Data General's stock has jumped 43 percent from $14 to $20 since Jan. 1, closing at $19.25, down 25 cents, on Friday. Several analysts have switched their recommendations from hold to buy. **********''You have to give credit where it is due,'' said Peter Labe, an analyst with Buckingham Research Group in New York. ''They have met or exceeded expectations for six quarters now. We're past the point of calling it a turnaround.'' **********Mr. Labe said that he had not recommended Data General's stock since 1981, the year Mr. Kidder's book was published. **********Much has changed since Data General served as a bellwether for the minicomputer revolution that swept the industry in the 1970's. By the mid-1980's, when Data General reached $1.3 billion in revenues, the computing world had embraced personal computers, and sales of Data General's larger minicomputers quickly began to dry up. **********Data General was hit harder and faster than rivals like the Digital Equipment Corporation and I.B.M. because it lacked the large and loyal installed base of customers to sustain it through a transition to new products. **********Over the next decade, as the company scrambled to revamp its product offerings under the open-systems banner, sales of its Eclipse minicomputers dried up, falling by 40 percent annually starting in 1987. The old core business was disappearing faster than the new product, Aviion servers, could be put on the market. Last year, as revenues from the Eclipse line dwindled to $25 million (from $900 million in 1989), the minicomputer era ended for Data General. **********From 1986 through 1995, Data General lost $547 million, and the company laid off two-thirds of its work force. ''It was like a baseball bat to the knees,'' said Ronald L. Skates, Data General's 55-year-old president and chief executive. ''We came this close to going out of business,'' he added, with his thumb and index finger an inch apart. **********Some analysts remain conservative about the company. Shao Wang, of Smith Barney, said he was impressed with what he had seen, but he continues to put a neutral rating on the stock. ''The balance sheet is very clean and they are starting to attract some hotshot developers, but I'm not recommending it,'' he said. ''They've had such a long history of poor financial performance that six quarters of profitability feels relatively short. And these are the same guys running the show.'' **********Mr. Skates, an accountant from Price Waterhouse, took over as chief executive from the legendary founder of Data General, Edson D. de Castro, in 1989. Unlike such ill-fated rivals as Wang Laboratories and Prime Computer, Data General had avoided excessive debt, insuring that even in the worst of times the company always had more cash than debt and thus could narrowly avoid a Chapter 11 filing. **********Mr. Skates's strategy was to develop computers with open, nonproprietary systems for mid-sized companies. He entrusted the vision for the new products to Tom West, the hero of Mr. Kidder's book and a man who had somehow endured at Data General for 25 years, a notable feat in an industry marked by short bursts of technology genius followed by burnout. ''It's amazing they've been able to hold a talent like West,'' said Steven Smith, a Paine Webber analyst. **********Under Mr. West, the company developed its Aviion offerings and began building a fault-tolerant line of computers, which were built with twin systems, a main one and a permanent backup to provide a safety net against system crashes. In the early 1990's, short of cash to support the fault-tolerant products and fearing that that market was shrinking, Mr. Skates killed the project. But the development team had already produced the fault-tolerant storage system, which put Data General at the forefront of a new market. **********At first, Mr. Skates said, he did not realize what he had. At an Aviion product announcement in New York City in 1991, a financial analyst spotted the storage system and leaned over to Mr. Skates. ''This is a phenomenal product,'' he said. **********Intrigued, Mr. Skates returned to Westboro and immediately set up a separate business unit to build and sell the storage product, named Clariion. Lacking the financial resources to build a sales force to sell the product, he decided to offer the system to rival computer makers to sell under their own brands. **********It was a move into new territory for a company used to selling directly to customers. But ''Data General had the right product at the right time to catch an opportunity,'' said Clive Surfleet, marketing manager for Hewlett-Packard's Enterprise Storage Solutions Business. **********Hewlett-Packard became the first and biggest partner for Data General, reselling the Clariion product under the Hewlett banner. In less than four years, Clariion has become a $500 million business for Data General. Of that, nearly $300 million has been sold through Hewlett-Packard. Data General recently signed up other companies, vendors including Silicon Graphics and Storage Technology, to sell the product. **********Rick Chapman, senior vice president for information systems at Columbia/HCA Healthcare Systems, the $20 billion health care giant in Nashville, is one of Data General's largest customers, with an investment of up to $50 million in the company's systems. Mr. Chapman praised Data General's technology and its prices, which are generally lower than competitors. **********This year, the company is scheduled to introduce two new product lines. One is a more powerful high-end version of the Aviion server. The other is a small server to distribute information to a network of computers aimed at Internet users and planned to sell for less than $1,000. **********The new server, called ThiinLine, will be at the forefront of a family of Internet ''appliances'' that Data General plans to build in yet another separate business unit, Mr. West said. He pointed out that the ThiinLine concept complements the growing market for network computers, the low-priced, scaled-down Internet terminals that will provide easy access to simple Internet functions like E-mail and browsing. **********''There are 7 million servers on the Internet now and predictions are that there will be 70 million in the next two or three years,'' Mr. West said. ''The question is: what will these servers be? They will not be refrigerator-sized minicomputers or even general purpose computers. More likely they'll be specialized, single-function appliances with a two-button interface and the ease of use of a toaster.'' **********Despite its recent run of success, a decade of ill fortunes has rendered the company all but invisible, or worse, irrelevant. Although Mr. West said that recruiting top talent had become easier, Mr. Skates said his two biggest challenges were increasing the size of the sales force, from 800 to 1,100 people, and getting Data General's name on the lists of potential vendors at large companies. **********''We have a high success rate when we get a chance to bid, but the problem is we don't get invited in enough,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/17/your-money/IHT-briefcase-commodities-vehicle-for-small-investors.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-05-17", "snippet": "Taking refuge in commodities has long been a defense against inflation, but not something readily available to small investors.

But yesterday the major stock market indexes fell by about 8 percent in Brazil, 4.5 percent in Mexico and 5 percent in Russia -- two to four times worse than the 2 percent decline suffered by American stocks. **********''There really didn't seem to be a place to hide yesterday,'' said Rajeev Bhaman, co-manager of the Oppenheimer Developing Markets fund. ''When the sentiment goes against a class of assets like the emerging markets, everything goes together.'' **********The widespread fallout from the Asian currency crisis, which caused the Hong Kong market to fall 10.4 percent yesterday, started to take a toll on American mutual fund investors, who previously this year have shown some skittishness at volatility in the American stock market. **********At T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, investors generally appeared to be moving money out of international funds yesterday and into either United States stock funds or money market funds, said Steven Norwitz, a spokesman. Similarly, at Fidelity Investments in Boston, investors made slight redemptions in international funds yesterday while moving money into domestic growth stock funds or money market accounts, said Teri Kilduff, a spokeswoman. And at Charles Schwab & Company in San Francisco, investors made net withdrawals of $13 million from mutual funds of all types yesterday, a spokesman said. **********What happens now in emerging markets around the world could depend as much on the reactions of American mutual fund investors as on the plans of central bankers around the globe. **********''If people end up withdrawing capital from these emerging markets, they could all be in trouble,''  Mr. Bhaman said. ''People may end up saying that because things are bad in China, they don't want to lend money in Brazil.'' **********So far, however, the problems have been contained in Asia, and nearly all of the withdrawals from emerging market mutual funds in recent weeks have been from funds that specialize in the Asian and Pacific markets, said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund cash flows. **********In the week ended Wednesday, Asian funds suffered net outflows of $53 million, while emerging market funds overall took in $149 million, Mr. Adler said. **********Funds investing in the Pacific region had already fallen 10 percent to 20 percent this year, before the sharp declines this week. And while most fund managers say they are attracted by the greatly depressed prices in Asian markets, they have been reluctant to plunge in and buy in the middle of the downturn. **********''The question is do you want to get in the way of a falling safe, even though you know there's lots of money in it,'' said Robert Swift, a senior portfolio manager at Putnam Investments. ''Right now, people are stepping aside.'' **********And when they do participate, they are as likely to raise cash in order to brace themselves for possible redemptions by shareholders. ''Depending on how fast we see stability returning, I think we could see investors make a high level of redemptions in emerging market funds in the next few weeks,'' said Angeline Ee, co-manager of the Montgomery Emerging Markets fund. **********That could spread the weakness in Asia to other regions. The markets outside of Asia that most worry fund managers include Brazil, which suffers from several of the same negative economic factors that have led to currency declines in Asia. **********''We have concerns about the real,'' the Brazilian currency unit, Ms. Ee said. ''Brazil has a current account deficit, a fiscal deficit, and the real is currently overvalued. I think that is why it was hit so hard today.'' **********Brazil is also one of the largest, most liquid Latin American markets, which means that it is one of the first emerging markets that mutual fund managers turn to when they need to sell stocks quickly. **********Other, smaller South American markets, however, appear to be less vulnerable. **********Certainly, Latin American stock funds still have big gains for the year, as do Russian funds. In Eastern Europe yesterday, Russian blue-chip stocks were hit the hardest, but stocks of smaller companies fell much less sharply yesterday. **********Christian Strenger, chief executive of Deutsche Bank's mutual fund unit, said he believed that because much of Russia's economic growth is internally generated, rather than dependent on exports, it does not face many of the dangers that have recently afflicted Asian markets. **********Whether Asia experiences the V-shaped decline and recovery that investors saw in Mexico two years ago, or a longer, drawn-out recovery like that experienced in Japan in recent years, depends on who steps forward to help the Asian countries and how willing those countries are to make often-painful economic adjustments. **********Not all Asian markets fell apart yesterday, and some managers foresee that the long-lasting effect of the currency problems there will be to make products from Asian countries more competitive. **********Stock prices rose in Taiwan, for example, and one big industry there -- makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment -- could find that Asian currency declines have made their products more attractively priced relative to those of American and Japanese rivals. **********For investors in emerging market mutual funds, the least effective way to grapple with crisis is likely to be withdrawing money from emerging markets now, only to pour it back in when the stock markets appear on the upswing again is likely to be a fruitless pursuit. **********''Emerging markets have gained 15 percent annually over the long term, but that can vary by 40 percent each year,'' said David Bugen, a financial adviser in Chatham, N.J.

O'Hagan, a Minneapolis lawyer who had made $4.3 million in trading in Pillsbury stock and stock options after he had learned that Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. a London-based client of his firm, planned a hostile takeover bid for Pillsbury. The Minneapolis food company's share price soared after the Grand Met offer was disclosed. **********His conviction had been overturned by an appellate court that concluded that his conduct was not illegal because he was not an insider of Pillsbury, the company whose stock was being traded. **********Under the standard approved yesterday by the Court, anyone who gains inside information under conditions in which that person knows it is supposed to remain confidential may not use it for trading. That could cover anyone from a financial printer to a law firm secretary. But it would not cover someone who learned of the information by chance, such as overhearing a conversation in a bar. **********The Supreme Court decision, by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, reinstated the conviction and in so doing upheld the ''misappropriation theory'' that the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis had ruled invalid. That theory had been used in many insider trading cases in recent years, among them those against Ivan F. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine, two Wall Street figures who went to jail in the 1980's. Had the appeals court's opinion been the law then, they would probably have escaped prosecution. **********''This decision reaffirms the S.E.C.'s efforts to make the stock market fair to all people, whether you're a Wall Street veteran or a Main Street newcomer,'' said Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********The court ruling had been anxiously awaited at the S.E.C., which feared that the scope of current insider trading laws could have been severely narrowed. The S.E.C. brings civil cases on insider trading, while the Justice Department brings criminal ones, like the case against Mr. O'Hagan. **********Under the so-called classic theory of insider trading, which was not at issue in yesterday's decision, it is illegal for a corporate insider, or a temporary insider like a lawyer for the company, to trade in that company's securities on the basis of material nonpublic information. It is also illegal for someone who was tipped by such an insider to do so. **********The misappropriation theory extended liability to those who used such information from one company to trade in securities of another company. **********''It makes scant sense to hold a lawyer like O'Hagen'' to have violated the law, Justice Ginsburg wrote, in a decision signed by five other Justices, ''if he works for a lawyer representing the target of a tender offer, but not if he works for a law firm representing the bidder.'' **********She said the misappropriation theory was ''well tuned to an animating principle'' of Federal securities law, ''to secure honest securities markets and thereby promote investor confidence.'' **********While the misappropriation theory will most often be used in the context of corporate takeovers, it could have other uses as well. For example, an employee of the Food and Drug Administration who bought stock in a pharmaceutical company with the knowledge that the Government was about to approve a new drug could be charged under the theory. **********Even with yesterday's decision, some people with inside information would still be free to trade on it. Someone who obtained it innocently, such as by finding a document accidentally left in a taxi, could trade on the information. And while those who get tips from insiders would still be liable in most cases, the Government must show that the person receiving the tip knew or had reason to know that the person giving it was violating a confidence. **********The misappropriation theory was developed by courts after earlier Supreme Court rulings that had rejected cases brought against a financial printer and a securities analyst for trading on material, nonpublic information. It had been endorsed by several circuit courts of appeal, but rejected by two, leading to the Supreme Court decision. **********In the Supreme Court's only previous consideration of the misappropriation doctrine, a 1987 decision regarding R. Foster Winans, a former Wall Street Journal columnist who had bought shares before publication of a column about those stocks, the Court split 4 to 4 on that issue and did not issue a ruling. That left standing a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York affirming the theory, but did not create a precedent binding on other circuits. **********Mr. O'Hagan was convicted on 57 counts and sentenced to 41 months in prison. In addition to violating the insider trading law, he was convicted of mail fraud and of violating an S.E.C. rule that bars insider trading in connection with a tender offer. The High Court reinstated all the convictions. **********Three Justices -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia -- voted not to approve the misappropriation theory. Justice Thomas, in a dissent, argued that the fraud committed by Mr. O'Hagan was on Grand Met, by depriving it of exclusive use of its information. The misappropriation was complete before the trade, and therefore the fraud was not ''in connection with'' the sale of securities, as required by the statute, Justice Thomas argued. **********Justice Thomas, joined by the Chief Justice, also said the S.E.C. rule on tender offers was illegal, but it was endorsed by the other seven Justices. All nine said they would reinstate Mr. O'Hagan's conviction on mail fraud charges. The appeals court had said that that conviction could not stand because it was based on the securities fraud conviction, but Justice Thomas rejected that argument. The others did not need to reach it, because they had affirmed one or more securities convictions. **********The case, United States v. O'Hagen, No. 96-842, was sent back to the Eighth Circuit, which may consider other parts of the appeal by Mr. O'Hagan that it had not previously considered because it had already thrown out the convictions. **********Mr. O'Hagan, who maintains that he bought Pillsbury stock and options to buy stock for reasons other than having inside information, has since been disbarred for embezzling $1 million from an escrow account he controlled. According to the Government, the insider trading was an effort to raise cash to cover up the original embezzlement.

As of Jan. 1, it became financially correct, too. **********You might have missed it in the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, but a provision in the law almost doubles the amount that a couple with a nonworking spouse can contribute to individual retirement accounts. **********Effective for the 1997 tax year, the change means stay-at-home spouses and their employed mates can invest up to a combined $4,000 in I.R.A.'s, up from $2,250, putting them on par with families in which both spouses work. **********Before, only families with two wage-earning partners could contribute the maximum of $4,000, or $2,000 apiece. **********''It recognizes the value of the work women do in the home and takes into account that most women who are not employed out of the home now, will be, and need to worry about saving for retirement,'' said Ellen Bravo, the executive director of 9 to 5, a national association of working women. **********The so-called ''spousal I.R.A.'' is seen as a way to encourage more women to save for retirement. Numerous studies show that women fail to save enough for retirement, and for several reasons. Women tend to move in and out of the work force, making their saving sporadic. They live longer, requiring their savings to be stretched further. And women still earn less than men, compounding the first two problems. **********While the money in I.R.A.'s grows tax deferred until withdrawn, families still must meet certain tests to get an immediate tax deduction for their contribution. First, the spousal I.R.A. is available only to couples filing jointly; these couples can generally take the full $4,000 deduction on their income taxes if neither person is covered by a pension plan. If at least one person is covered, the couple can still take the full deduction if their adjusted gross income is less than $40,000. A partial deduction is permitted for those with incomes of up to $50,000. **********Because many families will not be able to get an immediate deduction, they will probably skip the new spousal I.R.A. And families with income low enough to qualify for the deduction may have trouble coming up with the spare cash to contribute. **********''The new law could help those families who make less than $50,000,'' said Tom Cooney, a tax expert with Rippe & Kingston C.P.A., an accounting firm in Cincinnati. ''But unfortunately, a lot of those people can't afford to save that sum or they are already working.'' **********John L. Steffens, an executive vice president of Merrill Lynch & Company, said of the I.R.A. change: ''This is a very important first step. Is it absolutely the best thing that could happen for women? Probably not.'' **********But response was strong on the first business day that the expanded accounts were available. Merrill Lynch said that on Jan. 2, its customers opened 4,000 spousal I.R.A.'s, up from about 400 on the same day last year. Planners urged investors with more income to look beyond the deduction. The money in I.R.A.'s still grows tax deferred, as it always has, and that benefit is available to all taxpayers, regardless of income. **********''If you have the cash flow to do it, I think it's a good idea, even if you don't get a deduction,'' said Cindy D. Coddington, a financial planner with David L. Babson & Company in Cambridge, Mass. **********For people who have I.R.A.'s containing deductible and nondeductible contributions, there is one big downside: an accounting headache when it comes time to make withdrawals. **********Anyone interested in making an I.R.A. contribution should do so now instead of waiting until the last minute, which would be April 15, 1998, for the 1997 tax year. The sooner your money is invested in an I.R.A., the longer it has to grow tax deferred."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/17/business/face-lift-at-board-of-trade-high-tech-say-hello-to-primal-instinct.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1997-02-17", "snippet": "Chicago Board of Trade opens for business on Feb 18 with what is billed as 'the world's largest trading floor'; Board of Trade officials say advanced technology should help exchange maintain its longtime ranking as world's leading futures and opti...", "word_count": 1421, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Face Lift at Board of Trade: High Tech, Say Hello to Primal Instinct", "print_headline": "Face Lift at Board of Trade: High Tech, Say Hello to Primal Instinct", "body_text": " **********It's hoopla time at the Chicago Board of Trade, where what is proudly billed as ''the world's largest trading floor'' opens for business Tuesday morning. The new trading hall will be home to as many as 8,000 traders, brokers and support staff members. **********Board of Trade officials say the advanced technology should help the exchange maintain its longtime ranking as the world's leading futures and options marketplace. **********In fact, though, the new trading floor is not really a showcase of the cutting edge in trading technology. While the floor is ready for traders and brokers to use the latest  technology, the truth is that most have no intention of doing so for now. Trading on Tuesday will not look much different from trading last week, because the new floor is less a showcase than a reminder that the deployment of new technology is often retarded by the conflicting agendas, experience and fears of the people who will use it. **********The Board of Trade's chairman sees the new arrangement as a starting point that could accelerate technological changes there. ''The new floor creates an environment to get people to think less defensively about technology,'' said Patrick Arbor, the chairman. **********Ambivalence about new technology shaped the project from the very beginning. Early on, Board of Trade officials, sensitive to member criticism that the entire project was too ambitious, declined to invest $150,000 for a virtual reality mock-up of the new room. Mock-ups are a new but increasingly common architectural tool that compared with an old-fashioned model, gives clients a much truer perspective of how a room will look inside. But it all sounded too futuristic for Board of Trade officials. Only after the pits were constructed did members find problems with sightlines and other features that sparked bitter complaints and some revisions. **********''There's a lot of what's been done here that can't be explained except by referring to their traditions,'' said Charles Kinsey, chief executive of Space Management Programs Inc., the Chicago-based interior architect for the $182 million Board of Trade project and numerous other exchange building projects around the world. **********Those traditions start with ''open outcry'' trading, in which futures and options contracts on everything from corn to Treasury bonds change hands via shouted and hand-signaled bids and offers. Impenetrable to outsiders even when trading is calm -- and downright frightening when markets are moving fast -- it is a muscular world rooted in the 19th century, when the Board was created to trade corn contracts. **********Open outcry bears little outward resemblance to newer computer-based methods of trading where office-bound brokers and traders armed with sophisticated mathematical models and surrounded by screens of news and price information make deals with unseen counterparts as likely to be in Tokyo or London as across town. **********If where you sit in computerized trading is irrelevant, where you stand in open outcry systems is crucial. Brokers on the top rung at the outside of a pit have clear sightlines to booths at the edge of the trading floor from which they receive orders via hand signals. They also enjoy easier access than those in the pits to runners bringing information from other sources. They can also see the whole pit more easily, giving them an advantage in filling orders. **********Top-rung real estate at the Board of Trade's pits goes by general consensus to brokers with seniority and a track record of generating business in the pit. Many such brokers are reluctant to encourage the development of wireless communications and trading systems that could level the playing field for those deeper in the pit. They find allies for their position among traders in the pit who count on them for business. **********Over time, every pit develops a delicate ecology of relationships that new technology is bound to upset. It is an ecology so expensive and difficult to create from scratch these days that most new exchanges developed in recent years reside entirely on computers. But where it exists, open outcry is prized for making prices equally visible to all players. **********''There are all sorts of competing business interests within an exchange but there always seems to be a very strong sentiment of it ain't clearly broke don't fix it,'' said Daniel Rappaport, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, which plans to move to its new trading floor at the edge of New York harbor on Memorial Day. **********For a time starting in the late 1980's, the common wisdom in trading circles was that for all their benefits open outcry systems were destined to go the way of the dinosaur. Where pit traders traditionally had the best seat for taking the pulse of the market, the advantage was shifting to office traders with easy access to news services and other information that drives prices. Some trading floors, like the London Stock Exchange, gradually became deserted as trading shifted to computers. **********The Board of Trade pursued a wide range of actions aimed at sustaining pit trading, including investing in electronic systems that would handle some of its products during hours when the pits were closed. **********The most ambitious of those investments, a joint venture with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters to start a worldwide computer-based trading system called Globex, floundered both before and after the Board of Trade dropped out in 1994. The other, the Board's more modest Project A network, is growing steadily. **********The new floor comes on line at a time when many open outcry markets are thriving and many Board of Trade members feel less compelled to gamble on drastic changes. It was built primarily in response to overcrowding in the oft-renovated pre-World War II room across the street where Treasury bond futures, options and other financial contracts sensitive to changes in interest rates have been traded since the 1970's. These trades have mushroomed in tandem with the national debt. **********But many Board of Trade officials felt the building project had to add not just elbow room but better access to market information (the new room has giant electronic billboards carrying news from several wire services along with trading data) and faster communications among the employees and customers of trading firms. It also had to move everyone closer to paperless trading. **********That last goal requires electronic orders and record-keeping from start to finish, including the use of hand-held electronics in the pits. In essence, the people in the pits would have to combat the computer-equipped office traders by tying themselves into computer networks,  too. Without such technology to cut costs, speed up trades and record-keeping and provide clearer audit trails, the exchange might survive for decades but would almost certainly continue to lose market share to unregulated, over-the-counter traders. **********''We've put in place all the right building blocks with the new floor,'' claims J. Donald Karmazin, senior vice president of technology at the Board of Trade. **********Indeed, the new floor is designed to support the simultaneous use of 20,000 electronic devices, including 12,000 computers, 6,000 wired or wireless phones, and 2,000 video devices. Some 27,000 miles of cable on a service floor underneath the trading floor give member firms the flexibility to organize their voice and data equipment into local networks -- and reorganize them on the fly -- without venturing on to the crowded trading floor. **********For now, though, the only activity close to the long-range technology goal is a pilot project for one firm, a subsidiary of Timber Hill Group of Valhalla, N.Y., to trade extremely small lots of Treasury bond futures with an entirely electronic system that numerous other exchanges and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have already approved. **********And only 14 firms will be initially putting clerks in the pits with devices that receive orders electronically, eliminating the pit brokers' reliance on hand signals from booths or paper slips that are now brought in by runners. Just 50 have signed up for wireless headsets although the new room is set up to handle hundreds of calls simultaneously. **********Suspicion that technology will cause more harm than good remains rampant. Other exchanges use video cameras to allow traders to see what is going on in other pits and provide the equivalent of instant replay footage in football games to settle disputes about whether a trade was really completed and who the parties were. The danger of such misunderstandings could be much greater in the new room, where pits are as much as 41 feet across, bigger than any the traders are used to. **********But fears that such cameras will become an abused instrument of surveillance for government regulators has led the Board of Trade to severely restrict their use."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/28/business/accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Wall Street Access, New York, to Burkhardt & Hillman, New York, to handle advertising for the brokerage firm, previously at Frankfurt Balkind Partners, New York.

Hundt, has failed in a last effort to schedule new auctions for wireless communications licenses that are held by companies in danger of defaulting on more than $10 billion in payments. **********Mr. Hundt spent the last two weeks trying to persuade his fellow commissioners to allow these companies to give back their licenses and participate in a new round of auctions without paying a heavy financial penalty. But the other three commissioners -- Susan Ness, James H. Quello and Rachelle B. Chong -- support an alternative proposal that would force the companies to forfeit millions of dollars. **********With his tenure as F.C.C. chairman likely to end next month, Mr. Hundt said yesterday that the commission would not be able to devise a solution before Congress appoints a new chairman and three commissioners. ''All this commission can do now is to bless a proposal, and that's a shame,'' he said in a telephone interview. **********The mounting financial troubles of the auctions have vexed the F.C.C. for more than a year. And Mr. Hundt's inability to solve the problem adds a sour note to the end of his otherwise productive term. Now, it is up to Mr. Hundt's nominated successor, William E. Kennard, to deal with these companies, which are tottering on the brink of insolvency. **********''You've got a three-way tug-of-war, and every solution leaves one party unhappy,'' said John Bensche, an analyst at Lehman Brothers who has advised the F.C.C. on how to deal with the troubled companies. **********The seeds of this impasse were planted in early 1996, when the F.C.C. auctioned off a swath of licenses for a new type of cellular service, called Personal Communications Services, or P.C.S. Although the licenses were reserved for small  entrepreneurial companies, they fetched huge prices, raising $10.1 billion for the Treasury. **********But the large numbers proved too good to be true. The winners of the P.C.S. licenses ran into financial trouble almost immediately, as the stock market turned hostile to wireless companies of all kinds. Last March, one of the largest bidders, Pocket Communications, filed for bankruptcy protection. And with several others threatening to do the same, the F.C.C. temporarily stopped collecting payments on the licenses. **********Since then, Mr. Hundt has been enmeshed in a tug-of-war with his three fellow commissioners about how to treat the license holders. He says the Government should forgive the bidders some of their debt to free up the licenses, so they can be reauctioned. Mr. Hundt's fear is that if the companies all filed for Chapter 11 protection, it would tie up the licenses for years -- depriving the F.C.C. of any revenue and consumers of new competitors in cellular service. **********''Bankruptcy litigation is the communications equivalent of a land war in Asia,'' said Mr. Hundt, who noted that he was familiar with bankruptcy law from his days as a corporate lawyer. **********But the other commissioners, led by Ms. Ness, contend that if the companies are absolved, it would corrupt the auction process and discourage other bidders from entering future auctions. Ms. Ness, along with Mr. Quello and Ms. Chong, have developed a plan that would relieve the bidders of some obligations, but would be far stricter than Mr. Hundt's approach. **********''To the extent that the F.C.C. disrupts the market, we are doing a disservice to people who believe in auctions,'' said Ms. Ness, who added that she is a former banker. **********Ms. Ness has softened her position in recent weeks. She said she would now be willing to allow companies to return half their licenses; in return, their debt would be halved. But she is adamant that the companies would have to forfeit their entire upfront deposit. **********Mr. Hundt said companies that returned half their licenses should be forgiven half their deposits. He also circulated a proposal under which a company would give back all its licenses, and would then receive a credit equal to half its initial deposit. The company could use its credit to bid in a reauction of those same licenses. **********For her part, Ms. Ness said such an arrangement would give an unfair advantage to existing license holders in a later auction. **********Whatever plan the F.C.C. adopts, the question is whether the companies or their creditors would return the licenses to the F.C.C. without any inducements. The F.C.C.'s negotiation with one bankrupt carrier, Pocket, suggests that the companies may play hard ball. **********Executives close to the company said the commission had offered Pocket a deal in which it would return all its licenses and be excused from its $1.3 billion in debt payments. But the company would forfeit its $130 million deposit. Alternatively, Pocket could return half the licenses and its debt would be cut in half. Lawyers for Pocket recently rejected the F.C.C. offer as unacceptable, according to these executives. **********But officials at the F.C.C. who are sympathetic to Ms. Ness said Mr. Hundt only offered that proposal after submitting an earlier plan that was far more generous to Pocket -- effectively dooming the later proposal. A spokesman for Pocket said the company would not comment. **********These F.C.C. officials, who declined to be identified, said Mr. Hundt was being obdurate in his refusal to compromise with his colleagues. They said he would rather put off the entire auction issue for the next F.C.C. than accept a plan other than his own. **********Mr. Hundt, meanwhile, tried to sound a collegial note. He said that the commissioners were far closer to agreement than they had been earlier this year. Among other things, all four commissioners now agree that the F.C.C. should not resume collecting payments until next March, giving the companies time to raise fresh capital. **********But time is not on Mr. Hundt's side. President Clinton nominated Gloria Tristani, a utility regulator from New Mexico, yesterday as his final nominee to the F.C.C. That opens the door to Congressional hearings on all four F.C.C. nominees, including Mr. Kennard. **********Barring any further hitches, Mr. Hundt may have to relinquish his office as soon as Oct. 3 -- leaving the thorny matter of debt-laden wireless companies for Mr. Kennard and his new colleagues to settle."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/23/business/international-business-new-economic-chief-sees-slow-march-to-open-china-markets.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1997-09-23", "snippet": "China's newly elevated economic chief, Zhu Rongji, says he plans to move cautiously in opening nation's markets and exposing its state-owned enterprises to foreign competition; Zhu also declares that it is 'unreasonable to exlude China from WTO,' ...", "word_count": 1133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Economic Chief Sees Slow March to Open China Markets", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; New Economic Chief Sees Slow March to Open China Markets", "body_text": " **********China's newly elevated economic chief, Zhu Rongji, said today that he planned to move cautiously in opening the nation's markets and exposing its sclerotic state-owned enterprises to foreign competition. **********But Mr. Zhu, in his first public comments since becoming one of the country's three top leaders last week, also declared that it was ''unreasonable to exclude China from the W.T.O.,'' a reference to the continued insistence by the United States that China agree to a rigorous timetable for liberalizing its economy before it can join the World Trade Organization. **********The Clinton Administration, officials in Washington say, is under growing pressure to relax some of those requirements before President Jiang Zemin makes a state visit to Washington late next month. Later this week, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin will spend two days in Beijing to set the stage for that meeting. **********While Mr. Zhu doled out morsels to a hungry audience of bankers and investors here today -- about new tax policies, protecting China's currency and finding work for millions of laborers whose jobs are threatened by privatization plans -- what he said was nearly overshadowed by how he said it. He joked easily, answered questions right from the floor, and made no effort to minimize the problems of China's deeply troubled banking system. **********''It wasn't exactly Oprah,'' a senior American official said afterward, ''but it wasn't the China we are used to seeing.'' **********On a key question many in the audience wanted answered -- how, exactly, China plans to transfer ownership of industries from the Government to some form of shareholding without casting millions of workers into the streets -- Mr. Zhu bobbed and weaved. But that was expected, mainly because he is considered the likely successor to Prime Minister Li Peng next spring. He has nothing to gain by further angering local officials who already view him as the architect of the downsizing process sweeping through China's resolutely noncorporate factories. **********For the Clinton Administration, perhaps the stickiest issue Mr. Zhu raised today was Chinese membership in the trade organization, a group of nearly 130 nations pledged to lower tariffs on imported goods and a regimen of steady economic liberalization. Two years ago, the Administration sent China a road map of changes it would have to make before it qualified, including a rapid end to subsidies of state enterprises. While some progress has been made in negotiations, officials fear there has not been enough for Mr. Clinton to declare at the talks next month that China is well on its way to membership. **********''This problem will be solved eventually,'' Mr. Zhu said with a broad smile today. ''It is unreasonable to make such demands on China, which is still a developing economy.'' **********There are some hints that the United States may soon back away from its hard-line stance, showing flexibility over the amount of time China will be allowed before it must comply with the rules. Japan has said it is ready to let China into the organization, which also acts as a court of world trading rules. Mr. Rubin is expected to talk about the issue when he meets Mr. Zhu and President Jiang at the end of the week. **********There were also hints today that China has been alarmed by the speed with which its Southeast Asian nations fell into a contagious currency crisis in recent weeks. Mr. Zhu said he had been advised to take his time before allowing investors to freely move capital of all kinds across Chinese borders. **********The Government-controlled China Daily said today that Liu Jibin, vice minister of finance, was backing away from any quick move to make the Chinese currency fully convertible into dollars, and vice versa. Mr. Liu was quoted as saying that the Southeast Asia crisis had sent ''a warning signal'' to other developing nations about the dangers of surrendering control of the currency to speculators and investors. **********Unlike the smaller Southeast Asians, though, China is coming to the markets well armed. Mr. Zhu disclosed today that foreign exchange reserves now stand at $131.6 billion, one of the highest levels in the world. They are so high, in fact, that officials traveling with Mr. Rubin say they believe the decision to keep that war chest securely in the bank may be unwise when the money could go toward buying power plants and other equipment that could help modernize industries that have changed little since Mao Zedong's death in the mid-70's. **********But over the long haul, Mr. Zhu declared today, Washington will get what it seeks: a far more transparent financial system. **********''To step up the reform of the financial system,'' he said, ''China will strengthen the currency-regulation function of the central bank and the financial supervisory systems, and promote the commercialization of state-owned banks.'' It is unclear, however, how he will dispose of huge loans that the banks made for political reasons rather than on the basis of credit-worthiness to failing state industries. **********''China will also improve the capital structure and quality of the commercial banks,'' he concluded, ''vigorously but steadily develop and regulate the financial market, improve and enact financial laws and regulations, and learn modern financial-management expertise.'' **********Already, Chinese leaders have found something in common with President Clinton that they can talk about next month: They have all been surprised that revenue has flowed into Government coffers faster than anyone expected. **********As a result, Mr. Zhu said, China would restore a series of tax exemptions for foreign technology and other goods that was revoked last year. **********''We will resume our policy of tax exemptions as early as possible,'' he said, leading some in the audience to speculate that in recent months the country had grown worried that American and Japanese companies were slowing their direct investments. Nonetheless, Motorola and General Motors, among others, are planning investments that could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, and tax incentives might help close the deals.                     --------------------        I.M.F. to Raise Assessments **********By Bloomberg News **********The International Monetary Fund plans to increase its members' contributions by 45 percent, to the equivalent of $285 billion, reflecting the increased size of the global economy. **********In a statement, the I.M.F. said on Saturday that its executive board had agreed to recommend that the amount of money members add to the fund be increased by the equivalent of $88.4 billion. **********The contributions, called quotas, determine the amount that a country can borrow from the fund as well as its voting power within the 181-member organization. **********The increase comes as the fund is warning private lenders that they may have to share more of the pain in future bailouts like those engineered for Thailand and Mexico. **********The United States is the biggest contributor, providing more than 18 percent of contributions, or $36.1 billion.

Rather than an across-the-board tax cut, the $96 billion package is a series of narrowly focused measures intended to achieve specific goals. How much you benefit depends on your personal circumstances. Here is a guide to achieving key financial objectives under the new rules. **********THE new and expanded retirement-savings accounts created by Congress and the Clinton Administration will no doubt provide an impetus for more people to salt away more money. But the new choices  of savings vehicles will also force many people to make complex decisions about how to allocate money among existing programs like 401(k)'s and the new options, as well as to factor in changes like the reduction in capital gains taxes. **********''The real benefit of the tax bill for people who qualify is that there are now a bunch of options that will point people in the direction of saving for retirement and starting early,'' said John H. Gardner, a senior manager in the Washington national tax office of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm. **********The tax bill expanded the traditional Individual Retirement Account in several ways, including raising the income limits restricting eligibility for making tax-deductible contributions and allowing penalty-free withdrawals for some college expenses and for up to $10,000 to buy a first home. **********But the most far-reaching change was the creation of a new retirement account, named the Roth I.R.A. after its principal sponsor, Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware. The new I.R.A. is likely to prove a big hit with people whose income has been too high to qualify for traditional I.R.A.'s, as well as with banks and brokerage firms, which are feverishly developing plans to sell a variety of Roth I.R.A. investment alternatives. **********Under the Roth I.R.A., contributions are not tax deductible. But income accumulates in the account tax free, and as long as the account has been open for five years and the proceeds are used after age 59 1/2 or for certain other purposes, distributions from the account are tax free. The tax-advantaged contributions to the Roth I.R.A. are limited to $2,000 a year, the same limit applying to tax-deductible I.R.A.'s. **********Many people will not have a choice between the Roth I.R.A. and the traditional tax-deductible I.R.A. Although the income limits for the traditional I.R.A. will double over the next decade, to $80,000 in modified adjusted gross income (generally total income minus income adjustments other than IRA deductions) for joint filers and to $50,000 for single filers, the limits will leave many of the people who have the most money available for retirement savings ineligible. The income limits for the Roth I.R.A. are much higher, at $150,000 in modified adjusted gross income for couples filing jointly and $95,000 for single filers. **********For those eligible for both types of I.R.A., the choice between the two s hinges largely on whether they think their income tax rate will be substantially lower when they use the money. **********Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, calculated that the Roth I.R.A. was slightly more profitable for the person whose tax rate would be the same at the time of both contribution and withdrawal. But, the firm said, for the person whose tax rate would fall between contribution and withdrawal, the traditional I.R.A. would be more profitable, although only if the person invested rather than spent the tax savings in the first year. **********People with existing I.R.A.'s will have another tough decision to make: whether to convert them into Roth I.R.A.'s. The law permits such rollovers for people with income of $100,000 or less. But such a conversion would require paying taxes at ordinary rates on the withdrawals from the existing I.R.A. Whether the long-term benefits of a rollover would outweigh the immediate tax bill would depend on several factors, but financial advisers said rollovers would be most attractive to people who expect to remain in high income-tax brackets after retirement, since proceeds from the Roth account could be withdrawn tax free. **********Financial advisers said people who are eligible for 401(k) programs in which the employer matches part of the contributions would probably find the 401(k) still the best retirement savings vehicle. But the calculation would become more complicated if there is no employer match, a calculation based on a person's expected income tax rate when withdrawals are made from the I.R.A., and on the investment's rate of return and other factors. **********For people who still have money for retirement savings after their maximum 401(k) contribution, the Roth I.R.A. would almost certainly be best. **********The reduction in the capital gains tax should also lead people who are saving for retirement through variable annuities to take another look at their strategy. **********Annuities are essentially mutual funds in which profits accumulate tax-deferred until withdrawal, when they are subject to ordinary income-tax rates. Because much of any long-term profit on mutual fund investments will be subject to lower capital gains rates, annuities will become less attractive to some investors. But others will continue to find annuities preferable, because they often entail less risk than mutual funds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/06/business/volkswagen-to-raise-4-billion-to-expand.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-09-06", "snippet": "Volkswagen AG says it will sell 6 million new shares, for about $4 billion, to expand operations in Asia or South America; company's shares plunge 8.8 percent amid concern that new shares would dilute existing shares (S)", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Volkswagen to Raise $4 Billion to Expand", "print_headline": "Volkswagen to Raise $4 Billion to Expand", "body_text": " **********Volkswagen A.G., Europe's largest car maker, said yesterday that it would sell 6 million new shares, raising 7.5 billion Deutsche marks, or $4 billion, to expand operations in Asia or South America.

''Their nest had been right there, just below the crest of beach. What a nightmare, this whole dreadful affair.'' **********Just across a channel from a United Nations-designated World Heritage site called Hinchinbrook Island, the Cardwell birds feed among threatened mangroves. The trees form a tangled scrim of tide-washed branches and roots, serving as a nursery for marine flora and fauna. **********That day three years ago, the bulldozer was cutting down some of the mangroves, preparing ground for a $100 million development of waterfront residences, shops, restaurants, a 210-berth marina and a hotel. Yet almost as fast as old mangroves were torn up, Mrs. Thorsborne, a 70-year-old widow, and legions of other conservationists were planting new ones, 12,000 seedlings in all. **********It is a testament to the intrepid trowel brigade, as well as to court challenges and any number of protests and demonstrations, that this development project, which has galvanized environmentalists throughout Australia, has made little progress in three years. **********Scars of the clearing remain. Some roads have been built on the site, dredging has started for the marina and glossy brochures have been printed. But although the developer has poured an estimated $12 million into the project, not one structure has risen and none of the blocks of real estate have been sold. **********The campaign to protect this stretch of Queensland coast from a project that would double the population of Cardwell, a fishing town of 1,200, has attracted support because of its proximity to one of the most environmentally fragile regions anywhere. **********Three miles across the Hinchinbrook Channel from Cardwell is Hinchinbrook Island, the world's largest island national park and a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, which stretches 1,500 miles along the coast. **********The island, channel and reef are all listed under the World Heritage Convention of the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization as worthy of special recognition and protection for the extraordinary diversity of their animal and plant life. **********The curlews may find other beaches. But the marine mammals flourishing around Hinchinbrook Island, and easily visible during one slow boat ride to the island, could be in mortal danger from scores of high-speed craft berthed in a new marina. **********The mammals include bottlenose, humpback and irrawaddy dolphins, and the even rarer dugongs, gentle creatures that hold their suckling young in their flippers and apparently love the taste of the sea grass around the island. **********Prof. Helene Marsh, of the department of tropical environmental studies and geography at James Cook University in Townsville, fears that dugongs will meet the same fate as their cousins, the manatees of Florida. From 1979 to 1991, she counted 628 manatees killed in collisions with boats in Florida waters. **********Professor Marsh estimates that 100 dugongs use Hinchinbrook Channel every year and that the population has remained relatively steady in recent years, although dugong numbers elsewhere along the Great Barrier Reef have declined. ''Even one fatality per year is likely to be unsustainable, on top of other impacts,'' she said. **********Yet Cardwell is sharply divided over the so-called Port Hinchinbrook development project. It is a town with no movie house, no supermarket, no high school and 12 long-vacant shops. Several modest motels, a gas station at either end of the main road and a couple of fish-and-chips establishments are the main features. You can drive through Cardwell in under 90 seconds, and most people do. **********So if tourism, which has brought prosperity to other parts of the Queensland coast, seems to have passed Cardwell by, some powerful figures think it only fair if it now catches up. **********Keith Williams, a colorful Queensland developer who bought the 260-acre site in 1993, has most of the local business officials on his side as well as the town council. **********Mr. Williams's main claim to fame is a Miami Beach-type project on nearby Hamilton Island, with high-rises, a 400-berth marina and an international airport that can handle Boeing 767's. **********Mr. Williams declined to return a phone call, but in press statements he has accused his opponents of using ''scare tactics'' to try to mislead residents about the effects of the development. **********A local real estate agent, Lindsay Hallam, who is seeking to sell 90 Port Hinchinbrook residential lots as well as condominiums and marina berths, is chairman of the Chamber of Commerce's Port Hinchinbrook committee. He says the town has been in decline a long time and ''needs the new facilities to get the jobs'' -- at least 50, he estimates, during the construction phase and 700 permanent jobs once the project is complete. **********In his office recently, Mr. Hallam pulled out charts and brochures and cited scientific evidence to try to lay to rest what he called misrepresentations of the project. **********''Of course we don't want people to destroy the area,'' he said. ''Far from it. If there are environmental problems, we say give us hard evidence. No one has done that.'' **********The rift between supporters and opponents is immediately evident from banners along the residential streets, which create the atmosphere of a political campaign. **********''So Long Dugong'' and ''No to Hinchinbrook Resort No Way'' face off against ''Port Hinchinbrook for Kids and Jobs'' or just ''Yes Yes Yes.'' **********As emotions have risen, so have reports of violence. Several protesters, many from Cairns and Townsville and some from as far away as Sydney, said they had been dragged through the mud and beaten. The police have rarely intervened, they said. So far, however, no one has been seriously injured. **********Mrs. Thorsborne, who lives in an old wooden house in a nearby rain forest surrounded by her beloved creatures, says she has received a telephoned death threat and been spat on in town. **********Another member of Friends of Hinchinbrook, Ken Parker, 38, who has been on disability since an accident at a local prawn farm, says he has received ''four or five telephoned death threats, and been advised to leave the country.'' **********But Mr. Parker, a Scottish-born boat builder and sailor who has lived here for 12 years, laughs off the threats. As his aluminum skiff kept the developers' dredge in the distance, he pointed to a dugong surfacing briefly on the starboard side, a sea turtle to port. **********''This has to be one of the most beautiful places in the world,'' he said. ''I don't think I could ever leave.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/13/business/for-stock-values-a-yardstick-with-a-difference.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Brush", "pub_date": "1997-04-13", "snippet": "Price-earnings ratio, which compares stock price with company's profits per share, may be most common measure for finding low-priced deals in market; some investors turn to lesser-known instrument: price-sales ratio; this measure compares stock pr...", "word_count": 1384, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Stock Values, a Yardstick With a Difference", "print_headline": "For Stock Values, a Yardstick With a Difference", "body_text": " **********MANY investors treat the stock market like a flea market, poking through overpriced merchandise to find a real bargain. But rather than studying furniture styles or the history of glass making in the search for that low-priced deal, investors use statistical tools. **********The price-earnings ratio, which compares a stock price with the company's profits per share, may be the most common measure. Other bargain hunters look at a stock's price relative to the company's book value per share. **********Some, however, turn to a lesser-known instrument: the price-sales ratio. This measure compares the stock price with the company's sales per share, revealing how many invested dollars are needed to buy one dollar of revenue. At Disney, for example, the price-sales ratio is 2.31, derived by dividing the current share price ($72.375) by the sales per share ($31.38). Sales per share are calculated by dividing total sales ($21.18 billion) by the number of shares outstanding (675 million). **********The average price-sales ratio for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is 1.60. Value seekers typically focus on companies with low-priced stocks -- those with a ratio of less than 1. **********Investors who look to the price-sales ratio say it has several advantages. Although sales figures can be manipulated, they are not subject to all the stratagems that companies can use to embellish earnings or distort book value. ''Revenue is one of the things that is least fiddled with,'' said Kenneth L. Fisher, who runs Fisher Investments in Woodside, Calif. **********The price-sales ratio can also be a window on a company's near-term potential. A low price-earnings ratio -- signifying a cheap stock -- can simply mean the company has little revenue, and therefore little profit. Its shareholders are taking a leap of faith that the company can ring the cash register a lot more in the future than it has in the past.  But a low price-sales ratio often applies to a  company that already has significant sales; its costs just eat up much of its profits. In that case, all the company may need is an economizing program that widens the gap between what it takes in and what it keeps. **********''The price-sales ratio captures your imagination,'' said Edward Bousa, portfolio manager of the Putnam Equity Income fund. ''It gives you an idea of what an underperforming company could be worth if it got its margins up.'' **********In ''What Works on Wall Street'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996), James P. O'Shaughnessy, a money manager in Greenwich, Conn., found that from 1952 to 1994 companies with low price-sales ratios often sharply outperformed the market. In one calculation, involving the more than 10,000 companies with at least $150 million in market capitalization, Mr. O'Shaughnessy found that the 50 stocks with the lowest price-sales ratios had an average annual return of 15.42 percent over those 43 years, compared with 12.45 percent for the entire group. **********To study the price-sales ratio, The New York Times asked Compustat, a unit of Standard & Poor's, to rank all the nonfinancial companies in the S.& P. 500 by the measure. **********Of the 432 companies in the survey, which was conducted on Wednesday, Microsoft had the highest price-sales ratio, at 12.5, while the Fleming Companies, one of the nation's largest food wholesalers and distributors, had the lowest ratio, at 0.04. A total of 179 companies might draw the immediate attention of bargain hunters: they all had ratios of less than 1. **********But one of the first lessons of the price-sales ratio, Mr. O'Shaughnessy and others said, is that a low ratio by itself does not necessarily signal a good investment. **********For example, many companies in the survey have low price-sales ratios because they are in inherently low-margin businesses -- discount retailers, say, like Woolworth and Walgreen, which had ratios of 0.37 and 0.84, respectively. (When profit margins are so narrow that only a few cents land on the bottom line, investors pay less for a dollar of sales.) Generally, improving the margins of companies in such industries is not as easy as in other sectors. **********Other enterprises with low price-sales ratios belong to out-of-favor industries like paper and forest products, which are under pressure from lower-cost foreign producers and hurt by the strong dollar, according to Mr. Bousa. This group includes Boise Cascade (0.28), the Mead Corporation (0.59), Union Camp (0.81) and Westvaco (0.89). **********Similarly, according to Standard & Poor's stock reports, Fleming Companies had a rock-bottom price-sales ratio in part because supermarkets are starting to be food distributors themselves. That shift has helped push down the price of Fleming shares from about $30 in September 1995 to $16.25 at Friday's close. **********In other words, a low price-sales ratio is just the beginning. Investors must also scrutinize the company to see if it has the potential to improve its margins. **********In this further inquiry, Mr. O'Shaughnessy looks for companies whose earnings and stock prices have risen in the last year. ''This helps you find cheap companies that are on the rebound,'' he said. **********Such an approach has lead Mr. O'Shaughnessy to Kmart and TJX, retailers with price-sales ratios of 0.19 and 0.51, respectively, in the survey. **********In the early 1990's, Kmart lost market share to competitors like Wal-Mart and Target. In the last year, however, it has been closing underperforming stores, cutting corporate overhead, improving inventory and distribution systems and selling off interests in other retail chains to raise cash and strengthen its balance sheet. **********''The financial issues are almost out of the way, and they may pay off some debt ahead of time,'' Mr. O'Shaughnessy said. **********TJX, the discount-clothing chain that owns T. J. Maxx, is feeling the benefits of its acquisition of Marshalls, another off-price retailer, in late 1995. This has improved  buying power and lowered costs; indeed, the stock price rose from $17 to $47 last year in part because of these prospects. **********Moreover, TJX is far bigger than its largest competitor, according to a report by Jeffrey Feiner, of Salomon Brothers. That makes TJX ''a true emerging category killer,'' Mr. Feiner wrote. He also believes that the stock, despite its 1996 run-up, is cheap, at least when the company's projected earnings are considered. **********MR. BOUSA also seeks companies that have low price-sales ratios and  are cutting costs. He likes Whirlpool, Ryder System and Delta Air Lines. **********Whirlpool, with a ratio of just 0.40 in the Compustat survey, ''looks cheap for a company that is a leader in its business,'' Mr. Bousa said. Profits have been weak in its European divisions, he said, adding that he believes that the company has been ''very busy restructuring there, and we will soon start to see results.'' The company will also soon begin to see a payoff from its Asian investments, he said. **********Ryder, a leader in truck leasing and business shipping, had a price-sales measure of 0.43, but it is economizing, too. Closing less profitable offices and cutting some layers of management will help it save $75 million this year -- 1.6 percent of annual operating expenses -- and the same amount in 1998, Mr. Bousa said. ''At the moment, margins are well below what they should be,'' he said. ''I expect them to increase significantly over the next few years.'' **********Cost-cutting at Delta, the third-largest domestic carrier, is also well under way. Delta has been eliminating unprofitable routes in Europe, where new marketing alliances with Swissair, Sabena and Austrian Airlines may also help earnings. **********Delta, with a 0.51 ratio in the survey, is also trying to contain costs and increase productivity. ''Delta has done a tremendous job of working with a largely nonunion labor force in an industry that tends to be union,'' Mr. Bousa said. Moreover, Delta Express, which offers low-cost flights between the South and the Northeast, has limited inroads from discount carriers like Southwest and Valujet. **********What about high price-sales measures? Like the low ratios, they are just a guide.  Drug companies, for instance, often have wide profit margins. Thus, the Pfizer and Schering-Plough ratios of 4.9 and 4.8 do not  necessarily mean the stocks are pricey. **********But a lofty ratio can be a red flag. Microsoft's ratio of 12.5 is a caution for Richard H. Fontaine, portfolio manager of the Fontaine Capital Appreciation fund. **********''Microsoft is a great company,'' Mr. Fontaine said. ''But it is so big, it can only grow as fast as the industry. The premium the market is asking you to pay grossly overestimates the growth of this company.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/23/business/company-news-cisco-systems-to-buy-light-speed-a-software-maker.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-12-23", "snippet": "Cisco Systems Inc to acquire Light Speed International Inc for $160 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CISCO SYSTEMS TO BUY LIGHT SPEED, A SOFTWARE MAKER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; CISCO SYSTEMS TO BUY LIGHT SPEED, A SOFTWARE MAKER", "body_text": " **********Cisco Systems Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Light Speed International Inc., a closely held maker of software for communications companies, for $160 million in stock.

Phrases like ''environmental colonialism'' and the ''Western rape and pillage of the world's resources'' have  poured forth, along with predictions that Kyoto could forge a new and even deeper split between the richer and poorer nations of the earth. **********At one level, the Indian anger seems curiously misplaced, considering the acknowledged deterioration of India's own environment and the blame that many of these same environmentalists and politicians place on governmental failures at home. If India's environment is visibly among the most polluted anywhere, particularly in terms of air quality in the major cities, it is a problem closely linked to a burgeoning population, now nearly 980 million, that has almost tripled in the 50 years since independence and continues to grow by 20 million every year with scant sign of any government effort to promote birth control. **********As anybody struggling with the choking levels of air pollution in New Delhi, Bombay or Calcutta can attest, India is fighting a losing battle with urban traffic levels that double every five years, Dickensian factories that generally ignore environmental controls and the reliance in heavy industry on heavily sulfurous coal. The situation in New Delhi, the capital, has become so threatening that some Western embassies have begun discouraging the assignment to India of any diplomat or family member with respiratory problems, especially small children. Indian experts have even warned that rising sea levels could cost the country large portions of its 3,000-mile coastline within the next 50 years. **********But when it comes to international efforts to deal with global warming, many of those who will have a decisive voice in India's policies approach the issue as though environmental degradation is mainly the fault of, and a problem for, the industrialized nations of the West. If there were any doubt of the strength of feeling on the matter, it was dispelled when Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral attended the meeting in Edinburgh in October of the nations of the Commonwealth and agreed to a closing communique that said, seemingly innocuously, that all countries attending the Kyoto meeting ''will need to play their part in policies that would result in significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.'' **********Mr. Gujral was met with a barrage of criticism at home to the effect that he had sold out India and other developing nations with large greenhouse gas emissions, China and Brazil prominent among them. Those nations have said that it is up to the United States and other Western nations to cut back on emissions without imposing similar requirements on poorer countries that are struggling to catch up economically with the West. This position has been squarely rejected by President Clinton, who announced in September that the United States ''will not assume binding obligations unless key developing nations meaningfully participate in the effort.'' **********Indians marshal numerous arguments against their country's accepting any mandatory emissions controls. Many are rooted in political arguments that depict the ''one-worldism'' of Western environmentalists as a mask for efforts to shackle the economic development of poorer nations just as they show signs of beginning to claim a greater share of the world's wealth. **********Even among Indian environmentalists who accept the need for limits, there is a common political premise: that whatever environmental regime emerges from Kyoto should be based on ''per capita entitlements'' to pollute the atmosphere, an approach that would ultimately allow India and China, with nearly two-fifths of the world's population, to pump more carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere than the United States, Canada and all the nations of the European Union combined.

Well, if Mr. Dole had tried to rent a car with that card, he would have gone nowhere. **********The big car rental companies, including Hertz and Avis, have recently stopped letting people rent cars using just a Visa Check card or the similar Master Money card from Mastercard. The card companies, and the banks that issue these cards -- known as debit cards -- are furious. And so are some customers. **********For years, the car rental companies have used possession of a credit card as a crude way to weed out potentially risky renters, just as they have usually ruled out renters under the age of 25. **********But this test does not work with debit cards, because banks will now give them to nearly anyone with a bank account. Charges on debit cards, which go under many names, come directly out of a customer's checking account almost immediately rather than appearing on a monthly credit card statement. And in contrast to using a credit card, which the debit cards physically resemble, no loan is involved in the transaction. **********Debit cards ''provide no qualification of creditworthiness,'' Lisa LoManto, a Hertz spokeswoman, said. ''Hertz is entitled to a certain level of confidence because in car rental, unlike almost any other business, the customer is given total control of a vehicle with an approximate value of $20,000.'' **********There are now more than 60 million Visa and Mastercard debit cards in use. They differ from the debit cards that are linked to automated teller machine networks like NYCE or MAC because their use at a retailer requires a signature rather than keying in a personal identification number. **********As these debit cards become increasingly popular, strains are appearing among customers, merchants and banks. The problems range from difficulties when the cards are lost or stolen to complaints from merchants -- including the nation's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart -- that the fees to accept these cards are too high. The new car rental rules represent the first case in which debit cards cannot be used in the same way as credit cards. **********Jack T. Kelly, owner of Pied Piper Real Estate in Provincetown, Mass., gave up all of his credit cards because he liked using his Master Money card instead. But he found himself potentially stranded when Hertz told him it would not accept his card to reserve a car for a coming vacation in Palm Springs, Calif. **********''They say that this card is usable anywhere a Mastercard is, and it certainly is not,'' he said in a telephone interview, fuming that the $23,900 balance in his checking account did not get Hertz, a unit of the Ford Motor Company, to change its policy. ''There are a lot of people like me who have done away with their credit cards and now are stuck.'' **********The rental car companies are requiring a customer with only a debit card to follow the same procedures as someone who pays cash. That involves making an application several weeks in advance and leaving a substantial deposit. **********Consumer advocates, who have battled the rental companies with accusations that they practice racial and age discrimination in renting and charge unjustifiably high insurance rates, said the new debit card rule might well be reasonable. **********''If we argue the car rental companies are responsible for any damage over $100 and that they can't discriminate on race or age,'' said Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group in Albany, ''they should be able to make renters meet other tests. People who don't have a credit card should be able to rent a car, but they may have to go through a 30-day credit check.'' **********The card companies are split over how hard to defend their longstanding policy that credit and debit cards should be treated interchangeably. **********Stacey A. Pinkerd, the product manager for Visa's check card, said Visa ''reluctantly'' went along with the change. ''The car rental industry is unique because they are letting a customer drive their assets off the lot,'' he said. **********Mr. Pinkerd said Visa did insist that a customer be allowed to switch the rental payment to a debit card when the car is returned, even though a credit card had to be used to obtain the car. And he said Visa is working to find another way for car rental companies to screen debit card users. **********Mastercard, unlike Visa, says it intends to fight for equal treatment of debit cards. **********As for the banks that issue debit cards, they are upset that their debit card customers are being treated differently. ''We have received customer complaints about their inability to use a debit card to rent a car,'' said Richard Comandich, senior vice president of U.S. Bank in Portland, Ore. ''We hope Visa looks at the issue closely.'' **********Other bankers, speaking on the condition of anonymity, are much harsher. ''Visa has compromised the brand,'' one bank executive said. **********In 1996, there were 1.6 billion transactions on Mastercard and Visa debit cards in the United States, an increase of 95 percent from the year before. By contrast, there were 1.1 billion debit transactions linked to A.T.M. networks, up 32 percent, according to Bank Network News, a Chicago newsletter. **********The new debit cards have become more popular because they are easier to use and more widely accepted than those that require personal identification numbers. Moreover, for the tens of millions of Americans who do not qualify for a credit card, the cards are their first opportunity to put something with a Mastercard or Visa label in their wallets. Until recently, the cards also provided the easiest way for such individuals, many of whom have had financial troubles, to rent a car or buy merchandise over the phone. **********Banks like the debit cards because transactions on them are less costly to process than paper checks. Also, some banks charge customers a fee for the cards. And for the Mastercard and Visa versions, banks receive a fee from merchants of about 1 percent of the purchase price. **********Retailers, though, have become increasingly unhappy about the growth of these debit cards, precisely because they do not want to pay the fee. **********In October, Wal-Mart and the Limited sued Visa over its rule that forces merchants to take the debit cards if they also accept Visa credit cards. In February, the National Retail Federation joined the suit and added Mastercard as a defendant. **********What especially galls the retailers is that for them the Visa and Mastercard debit cards are a lot more costly than the older A.T.M. network debit cards, which charge only a few pennies per transaction. **********Confusingly, a single card can have both a Visa or Mastercard logo and the mark of an automated teller machine network like NYCE or MAC. If a signature is required, rather than a personal identification number, the fee paid by the merchant is higher. The credit card companies say the higher fee reflects a greater risk. Even though both types of transactions involve electronic verification of the money in the consumer's checking account, the card companies say their experience has been that signature transactions, which are processed more slowly, result in more overdrafts. **********For consumers the debit cards also carry a little more risk. If the card is stolen, a thief can go on a spending spree with the money in a customer's checking account. Federal law limits liability to $50 if the cardholder notifies the bank within two days of discovering a missing card. But the bank has up to 20 days to put the money back into the checking account. **********For Jack Kelly, the real estate agent who was not able to rent from Hertz, debit cards are losing their appeal. ''I was able to rent a car from Budget, but I don't think that will last,'' he said. ''If this doesn't change, I'll go back to using American Express.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/14/business/first-foreigner-to-lead-japanese-company-retires.html": {"writer_name": "Stephanie Strom", "pub_date": "1997-11-14", "snippet": "Mazda Motor Corp says Henry D G Wallace, first foreigner to head a Japanese company, is retiring as president; James E Miller, Mazda executive vice president, will replace Wallace, whose contract is scheduled to expire in June; Miller, an American...", "word_count": 463, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "First Foreigner to Lead Japanese Company Retires", "print_headline": "First Foreigner to Lead Japanese Company Retires", "body_text": " **********The Mazda Motors Corporation said today that Henry D.

Miller, 50, a Mazda executive vice president, will replace Mr. Wallace, whose contract was scheduled to expire in June. Mr. Miller, an American who has been groomed for the top spot at Mazda, is a former marketing executive at the Ford Motor Company, which owns 33.4 percent of Mazda. **********The resignation of Mr. Wallace comes after recent speculation, which Mazda did not deny, that he would be leaving. At the Tokyo Motor Show last month, there was talk that Mr. Wallace might leave because his wife was unhappy living in Hiroshima, where Mazda is based. **********Kaoru Kurata, the automotive industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs Japan, said, ''I'm slightly surprised, but we analysts have been assuming he would leave the company at the end of the year or early next year.'' **********The company was scheduled to release its six-month interim financial report today. Analysts expect Mazda to report 10 billion yen, or $80 million, in net losses for the first six months of the current fiscal year.  But they are confident that Mr. Wallace has engineered a turnaround that will start showing up in next year's numbers. He has streamlined management practices, forbidding senior managers from bringing support staff members to meetings and  establishing a promotional track based on merit rather than seniority. **********He also cut costs without layoffs and strengthened the company's ties to Ford. The companies have aligned their production cycles and will be sharing vehicle platforms and power trains. **********In Japan, where auto sales were down 9.6 percent in the first half of this year, Mazda was the only car maker whose sales did not shrink, said Edward Brogan, an automotive analyst at Salomon Brothers. The company introduced a small mini-van, the Demio, which was aggressively priced but profitable because it sold well. **********''They were surprised by its success,'' Mr. Brogan said. ''It was originally designed to draw people into the showroom.'' **********Though sales have improved in Europe, Mazda's sales in the United States, however, continue to lag, and the company has had to cut back on research and development and capital expenditures while getting its house back in order. **********Mazda's ads in Japan, featuring Mr. Wallace, a 6-foot-2-inch Scotsman speaking halting Japanese, are popular. **********''Using him as the face of the company has probably strategically been an error, given that he never said he was going to stay here forever,'' Mr. Brogan said.

That mantra from a Federal Express Corporation advertising campaign sums up the ambitions the overnight shipping industry has for computer technology. Express companies compete with each other and the United States Postal Service not only on speed, price and reliability, but also on convenience and ease of use, and that is where computers come in. **********The World Wide Web is one of three main avenues for computerized service, providing basic information and performing a few useful tasks, primarily for occasional customers. For high-volume shippers, many of the big express companies supply special software to speed the flow of overnight letters and rush parcels. And the freight specialists offer ''logistics solutions'' to businesses, combining automated record-keeping with other services like handling of customs formalities. **********The most widespread function is tracking. Enter a shipping order number, and in some cases one more piece of data like the country of origin, into a screen form, and the site reports whether the parcel has been delivered, along with when, where and to whom. All the companies listed except TNT Worldwide Express, a subsidiary of TNT Ltd. of Australia, offer tracking through Web sites; Federal Express also offers tracking by return E-mail. **********Most of the sites offer a directory function that will provide the address, phone number and business hours of the company office nearest a given ZIP code in the United States. United Parcel Service also includes its drop boxes in office buildings and industrial parks, and gives the latest pickup times for each; Federal Express includes drop boxes and retail stores that accept packages for it. **********Looking up any of the companies' offices overseas is usually a less friendly process. DHL Worldwide Express, like some others, lets youchoose the desired continent by clicking on a map. After that, it usually is a matter of manually scrolling through lists of countries, and then cities in the country, though some sites will search for a specified city. The Fedex site seems at first glance to offer extensive information about each country it serves, but on closer inspection almost all of it turns out to be generic, with little other than contact numbers changing by country. **********Another common feature of all the express company sites is a big helping of the sort of public relations boilerplate that most corporate sites offer: company histories and mission statements, news releases and annual reports -- of interest to a potential employee or stockholder but little use to a customer. **********Special features make a few of the express company sites stand out. **********If you already have a Federal Express account number, you can generate a completed shipping order on your laser printer.

Overnight letters are a sideline business for the ''snail mail'' people, but they can be tracked on line just as their commercial competitors can be. There is a comprehensive postage calculator in the site, but it requires a cumbersome march through as many as five linked pages to arrive at an answer; tables of postal rates are also available. And post office addresses can be looked up for any ZIP code. **********The rest of the service's huge site is devoted to reams of material on postal policies and regulations, contract bidding and procurement, stamp collecting, address changes, missing money orders, shipping supplies and passport applications, as well as miscellaneous red tape."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/19/world/pro-islamic-premier-steps-down-in-turkey-under-army-pressure.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1997-06-19", "snippet": "Prime Min Necmettin Erbakan, first head of Islamic party to lead Turkey, yields to pressure from military and resigns on June 18 after nearly a year in power; asks Pres Suleyman Demirel to keep his coalition in power by naming Foreign Min Tansu Ci...", "word_count": 932, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pro-Islamic Premier Steps Down In Turkey Under Army Pressure", "print_headline": "Pro-Islamic Premier Steps Down In Turkey Under Army Pressure", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, the first head of an Islamic party to lead Turkey, yielded to pressure from the military and resigned today after nearly a year in power. **********''I resigned because I am a true patriot,'' Mr. Erbakan said after a 45-minute meeting with President Suleyman Demirel. He asked the President to keep his coalition in power by naming his junior partner, Tansu Ciller, the secular Foreign Minister, as his successor. **********President Demirel made no statement, however, and aides said he would begin consultations with party leaders on Thursday. **********Mr. Erbakan, who will remain in office until his successor is sworn in, had been subjected to a sustained political assault by senior generals who complained that he was undermining the secular basis of Turkey's modern republic and its pro-Western stance in foreign and military affairs. **********In the year that Mr. Erbakan held office, the generals objected to overtures he made toward Iran and Libya, repeatedly took military initiatives without consulting him, and recently expressed fury at his refusal to curb religious academies and private Koran schools. **********The generals' political intervention never went beyond strong public statements. But the statements had escalated to the point that they seemed to imply the threat of direct action against Mr. Erbakan's Government. On three occasions since 1960, Turkey's military has staged coups after losing patience with civilian governments. **********The generals' campaign against Mr. Erbakan provided Turks with the spectacle of a powerful institution claiming to be so committed to defending democracy that it uses means that in many countries would be considered undemocratic. **********In fact, some critical commentators called the tactics a ''soft coup.'' But one secular leader, Denis Baykal of the Republican People's Party, said the military had played the role of a ''democratic pressure group.'' **********''We cannot ignore the fact that the army has contributed to this development,'' Mr. Baykal said. ''The thorn that dug itself into the foot of the democratic regime has been plucked out.'' **********Whoever President Demirel, the country's elder statesman, chooses as Prime Minister must put together a government that can win support from a majority of the 550 members of Parliament. With major parties suffering defections and party leaders offering various inducements to wavering members, it is highly uncertain that either Mrs. Ciller or the main opposition leader, Mesut Yilmaz, could succeed. **********President Demirel's other alternative is to name a caretaker government that would lead the country to elections within 90 days. **********Despite his resignation today, Mr. Erbakan, a veteran of three decades in Turkish politics, remains popular and has shown no intention of leaving the political stage. On the contrary, he said earlier this week that he would step down only as a way to reinforce his mandate through new elections. He likened such a maneuver to ''an airplane being refueled while it is flying.'' **********It is not clear when elections might be called, but aides to Mr. Erbakan said he would like them to be held as early as possible, perhaps in October. A federal prosecutor has filed a suit asking that Mr. Erbakan's Welfare party be banned as subversive, and party leaders fear that if elections are not held soon, an unfavorable verdict might prevent them from running at all. **********In an election, Mr. Erbakan would probably be helped by the lack of unity among secular parties. His Welfare party might be able to win votes by positioning itself as the victim of intrigues by military officers, press barons and other anti-Islamist figures whom he has denounced as ''secular fascists.'' **********In the absence of a strong leftist party here, Welfare has also become the political home of many villagers, migrants and poor people who feel themselves left behind by the social injustices that have accompanied Turkey's economic boom. In that sense, it is similar to many Islamic parties in North Africa and the Middle East, where the mosque has become a focus for social discontent as well as religious fervor. **********Still, various opinion surveys indicate that the military is the most respected institution in Turkey. Its actions against Mr. Erbakan have sharpened its profile as the guarantor of secular rule, but have also led to criticism that it is overstepping its mandate and acting as a partisan political force. **********Mr. Erbakan's Government was the 54th since the founding of modern Turkey in 1923, and the fifth in two years. The Welfare party won 22 percent of the vote in the December 1995 election, and secular parties spent months trying to form a government without him. Because of personal and political disagreements, they failed. **********Six months after the election, Mr. Erbakan forged an unlikely coalition with the secular True Path party. The True Path leader, Mrs. Ciller, became deputy prime minister and foreign minister despite the fact that she and Mr. Erbakan had traded bitter charges during the campaign. **********Military commanders were suspicious of the Government from the moment it was sworn in 50 weeks ago. They were unhappy with Mr. Erbakan's decision to pay early visits to Libya and Iran, which they consider hostile. Later they reached accords with Israel without consulting him. Recently, they began an offensive against Kurdish guerrilla havens in Iraq without notifying him. **********The military's displeasure broke into view in February, when it demanded that Mr. Erbakan retreat from his pro-Islamic policies. They insisted that he curb religious schools and ban private Koran courses. After some hesitation he promised to comply, but did not do so. Military leaders were infuriated.  On Monday, Mr. Erbakan issued a veiled warning to political leaders who seemed to be urging military intervention. ''We are all in the same boat,'' he asserted.

Fabri-Centers, which is based in Hudson, Ohio, had disclosed in late 1995 that the S.E.C. might bring charges over its earlier financial statements.

These are prepared by company managements and are not usually audited, he noted. **********The S.E.C's complaint also highlighted the role that company estimates can play when earnings are figured, a role that many investors may not be aware of. **********According to the S.E.C. complaint, Fabri-Centers, which sells fabric for arts and crafts, knew the dollar amount of sales at each store. But it did not know exactly what items were sold, so it did not know exactly how much profit it made on the sales. The company's practice was to do a detailed inventory of each store once a year, figure out what its profit margins were, and then apply those margins to future sales. **********But in the last two months of 1991, during the company's busiest sales period, it did not check out any operating stores, the S.E.C. contended. When the company closed its books for the year in February, the profits of more than 70 percent of sales were estimated. **********When the company resumed doing inventories in January and February, officials discovered that their margin projections were far too optimistic, in part because of stiff price competition, the S.E.C. said. This information was not disclosed in the company's annual or quarterly reports, or in the registration of a convertible debt issue that the company sold in March 1992. The $3.3 million payment Fabri-Centers agreed to make is based on profits it made in the debt issue, Mr. Gerlach said. **********The S.E.C. contended that Fabri-Centers' financial officers continued to try to cover up the problems with their estimates, using various accounting gimmicks that inflated results for three quarters. **********Fabri-Centers soon stopped relying on profit-margin estimates because it installed cash registers that kept a running tally of what products were sold, said Ron Gaston, the current chief financial officer.

Most of these rollovers are caused by collisions with other vehicles, curbs and other objects, and not by swerving, two Federal officials said. **********Brakes on light trucks, which now account for one of every two family vehicles sold, are generally not as effective as car brakes, partly because Federal safety standards for trucks are slightly more lenient than those for cars, a leading brake engineer said. **********Large sport utility vehicles and pickups account for an unusually large share of pedestrian deaths, apparently because of their weaker brakes and lack of maneuverability, a senior regulator said. **********Meanwhile, sport utility vehicles are nearly three times as likely as cars to kill the drivers of other vehicles during collisions, said Thomas Hollowell, a top researcher at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. **********Regulators and insurers are becoming much more interested in the dangers posed by light trucks, to the dismay of auto executives, who worry that their most profitable models could soon be subject to tighter regulations or higher insurance rates. **********The Society of Automotive Engineers, a nonprofit group that plays a large role in setting technical standards, organized the conference in response to rising light-truck sales and growing industry interest in the associated safety issues. It was the industry's first gathering ever to review and seek solutions for the overall safety problems presented by light trucks. Journalists were not invited to the conference, but a reporter from The New York Times who registered was allowed to attend. **********In a speech at the conference, which focused mostly on sport utility vehicles, the auto industry's leading safety official responded indignantly to suggestions that a broad safety problem existed. Insurance data show that sport utility vehicles have a slightly lower death rate per registered vehicle than that of cars, said Barry Felrice, the director of regulatory affairs for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association. **********But Kennerly Digges, director of safety research at the National Crash Analysis Center, an organization financed by the Government and the auto industry, presented a study showing that once people in sport utility vehicles are involved in an accident, they are as likely to die as people in cars. That is true because the high death rate when sport utility vehicles roll over offsets the low death rate in all other collisions, Mr. Digges said. Sport utility vehicles are four times as likely as cars to roll over in an accident, he found. **********The insurance data cited by the auto manufacturers are not adjusted for the fact that sport utility vehicles are often driven by middle-aged parents who have few accidents regardless of what they drive. By looking at what happens to people in vehicles that are involved in accidents, Mr. Digges was able to focus on whether sport utility vehicles do in fact provide more protection. **********''People feel safer in them because they're higher and they're bigger, and as long as they're staying with all four wheels on the ground, they're fine,'' Mr. Digges said. ''But when they have four wheels in the air, there's a problem.'' **********Mr. Felrice said he was suspicious of researchers like Mr. Digges who use statistical tools to analyze death rates. He contended that the sheer size of sport utility vehicles had to improve occupants' chances of survival once they got into crashes. **********Auto makers contend that most rollover accidents occur when a vehicle hits a curb or other object with considerable force, upsetting the balance of the vehicle and causing it to turn over. Consumer Reports magazine has suggested that certain sport utility vehicle models can roll over even during tight turns without hitting other objects. But two Federal officials said today that 92 percent of all rollovers were caused by collisions or contact with other objects. **********Mr. Digges said sport utility vehicles rolled over so easily that even the best drivers were in danger because they might swerve to avoid an accident and hit a curb or another vehicle instead. Mr. Felrice acknowledged that the rate of rollover accidents in which someone died was two and a half times as high for sport utility vehicles as the rate for cars. But he contended that many of these rollovers occurred when young or impaired drivers hit curbs and other objects. Mr. Digges and Mr. Felrice agreed that the latest sport utility vehicles were less prone to roll over than earlier models. **********Mr. Felrice said the sheer weight of the biggest sport utility vehicles probably reduced their risk of rollovers. But Charles Kahane, a senior researcher at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, presented evidence in a speech today that the frequency of rollovers was the same for all but the very smallest light trucks, which have a higher rate. The centers of gravity for the largest light trucks are so high as to offset the stability provided by their extra weight, Mr. Kahane said. **********Among the more popular sport utility vehicles are the Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler, the Ford Explorer and Expedition, the Chevrolet Blazer and Suburban and the Nissan Pathfinder. **********Federal safety standards are more lenient for light-truck brakes than for car brakes for measures  like stopping distances, while light trucks in general are harder to control than cars when drivers try to brake and steer at the same time, said John H. Sapp, the senior brake systems manager at Lucas Varity, one of the world's largest brake manufacturers. Light trucks are required to be able to stop from 60 miles an hour within 216 feet, for example, while cars are required to stop within 204 feet, he said. **********While some light-truck models meet some of the car brake standards, Mr. Sapp said he could not think of any light-truck model that met all car brake standards. Federal brake regulations issued two years ago will require all but the biggest sport utility vehicles and pickups to meet car standards in 2002. **********Mr. Kahane said in his speech that weak brakes and lack of maneuverability might explain why the biggest light trucks accounted for an unusually large share of pedestrian deaths. Most light trucks were designed for use in rural areas, not densely populated cities and suburbs, he noted. **********Mr. Hollowell, the Government's top researcher into what happens to vehicles during crashes, presented a separate study today confirming growing suspicions in the auto industry that light trucks are unusually deadly to car occupants. **********Sport utility vehicles are nearly three times as likely as midsize cars to kill the drivers of other vehicles during crashes, while full-size pickups are more than three times as likely to kill other drivers, according to Mr. Hollowell's statistics. The statistics are part of a new Government study to be released in February, Mr. Hollowell said. He also said that the Government would conduct six crash tests in January and February pitting sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickups against midsize sedans. **********Light trucks pose a danger because they are heavier than cars, ride higher off the ground and have stiff frames, Mr. Hollowell said. The stiff frames do not absorb much energy during a crash, transferring more of the force of a crash to whatever they hit. When a Ford Ranger hits a concrete barrier during a Federal crash test, the peak force of the impact against the barrier is twice as great as when a slightly heavier Ford Taurus hits the same barrier at the same speed, Mr. Hollowell said. **********Two auto maker engineers said that they privately welcomed greater public scrutiny of light trucks because it would strengthen the hand of safety advocates inside the auto makers who have questioned the shift toward ever bigger vehicles. Until recently, industry engineers who spoke up about light-truck safety received little attention as marketing executives focused on the immense profits, said one engineer who insisted on anonymity. **********''Voices were heard,'' he said. ''They just weren't listened to.''. **********Mr. Felrice said that safety had always been a top priority for the auto makers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/02/business/amstrad-to-sell-unit-to-bosch-of-germany.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-04-02", "snippet": "Amstrad PLC, British consumer electronics maker, is selling mobile telephone unit Dancall Telecom to Robert Bosch GmbH of Germany for 92 million pounds ($150 million) (S)", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Amstrad to Sell Unit To Bosch of Germany", "print_headline": "Amstrad to Sell Unit To Bosch of Germany", "body_text": " **********Amstrad P.L.C., the British consumer electronics maker, said yesterday that it was selling the mobile telephone unit Dancall Telecom to Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. of Germany for $:92 million ($150 million).

His first stop was Honduras, where he and his Central American counterparts issued a joint declaration condemning China's designs on Taiwan. **********Though half a world away from East Asia, Central America has in recent years emerged as one of the main battlegrounds in the decades-old diplomatic struggle between China and Taiwan. Now, with Hong Kong under Chinese control, the scope and intensity of the contest between Communist Party leaders in Beijing and the prosperous island they regard as a renegade province have rapidly risen to new levels in this region. **********Of the 30 countries that recognize the Republic of China on Taiwan, rather than the People's Republic of China in Beijing, as the legitimate government of China, 14 are in Central America and the Caribbean. Taiwan's influence and generosity throughout the region are traditional and widespread and have led to increasingly conspicuous efforts by Beijing to neutralize that advantage. **********For Taiwan, relations with Central America and the Caribbean provide both political legitimacy and a promising market for trade and investment. This region's trade with China and Hong Kong is also booming, but China has been less successful, until recently, in efforts to persuade countries to recognize Beijing. **********''There have been rumors that after the first of July, perhaps the relations between my country and the nations of Central American and the Caribbean would be affected,''  Chang Hsiao-yen, Taiwan's Foreign Minister, said during a two-day visit here, referring to the date on which Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty. ''But those relations are solid and quite cordial, and I have come precisely to seek a better and more effective way to deepen them and increase our mutual support in the international arena.'' **********The maneuvering is especially intense here, and focuses on the Panama Canal, which the United States is scheduled to hand over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999. China is the fifth largest user of the waterway, while Taiwan has cultivated a particularly close relationship with the Panamanian Government and has made large investments here, including a container port at a former American submarine base. **********''The Chinese, both China and Taiwan, have spotted an opening and are trying to exploit it,'' an American military official said. ''The United States is leaving Panama, there's a void, and each wants to fill it.'' **********To increase its limited leverage in the region, China has not hesitated to brandish Hong Kong. Even before assuming control of the former British colony, Beijing had warned nations recognizing Taiwan that they would have to close their consulates and negotiate new arrangements if they wished to maintain a diplomatic presence in Hong Kong. **********That alarmed many governments in this region that have made millions of dollars selling visas or passports to Chinese from Hong Kong and the mainland. Typically, a relative or close friend of a president is appointed consul general in Hong Kong, and a healthy cut of the sales flows back into the pockets of top government officials. **********In Panama's case, there is also an implicit threat to the lucrative business of ship registrations. Panama is the flag of convenience flown by thousands of ships around the world, including many owned by Hong Kong or Chinese fleets. In the past, those fleets have often registered their vessels and crew members through the Panamanian consulate in Hong Kong; but now they may turn to the Bahamas, a competitor that broke relations with Taiwan in July. **********But Taiwan is not standing pat. In his meeting with Central American foreign ministers, Mr. Chang indicated that Taiwan might be willing to hire Central Americans to replace its estimated 240,000 ''guest workers'' who are currently imported from the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and other countries that recognize Beijing. **********During the meeting in Honduras, the countries of Central America described Taiwan as ''a sovereign country'' and said that only ''peaceful means should be used to reach national unification.'' They also agreed to a summit meeting with President Lee Teng-hui in September in El Salvador. **********At a time when the United States is reducing its own aid to the region, the indications of Taiwan's largess are becoming an ever more visible part of the landscape. Police cars and garbage trucks in Haiti, for instance, proclaim in French that they have been ''donated by the Republic of China on Taiwan,'' as do the trash cans in Castries, the capital of the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. **********Missions from Taiwan have helped increase rice yields and organized fishing and agricultural diversification projects. Taiwan also helps pay the operating costs of several foreign ministries and police forces in the region and regularly sponsors trips by government officials, military officers and journalists to Taiwan for training courses or ''familiarization visits.'' **********China's approach to the region, in contrast, seems to emphasize the stick much more than the carrot. The result of those hardball tactics, it would appear, has generally been resentment. **********''You gringos have pushed us around for 150 years, and we never liked it,'' said the Foreign Minister of one Central American country. ''So what makes the Chinese think that kind of Great Power arrogance would be any more palatable coming from them? For them to tell us not to recognize Taiwan is no different than Washington saying we shouldn't have relations with Cuba.'' **********$(After Central American countries said in late July that they favored a plan to readmit Taiwan to the United Nations, China issued a letter publicly warning that ''they would ultimately pay the price'' for that position. President Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua responded by denouncing the Beijing Government as one that has oppressed and slaughtered its own people, and on Aug. 3 he left Managua for a five-day official visit to Taiwan.$) **********Early this year, after a peace agreement brokered by the United Nations brought an end to 36 years of civil war in Guatemala, China delayed deployment of a United Nations military mission for nearly a month to punish Guatemala for its support of Taiwan's readmission to the international body. **********In Panama, Chinese pressures have been aimed primarily at the economy. More than a quarter of the $5.5 billion worth of goods sold in the Colon Free Zone each year are imported from Hong Kong, and Panamanian executives are accustomed to flying there on short notice to conduct business. Now, however, they are being told that the Panamanian Government's friendship with Taiwan means they need visas to enter Hong Kong, which is causing costly delays. **********''The dispute between China and Taiwan is a political one that ought to be resolved in East Asia and should not spill over into Latin America,'' Nessim S. Bassan, president of the Colon Free Zone Traders' Association, said. **********There are also some indications that China now feels it can play the game through Hong Kong intermediaries. In July the Bahamas switched recognition from Taiwan to Beijing after Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong conglomerate, agreed to invest more than $175 million in construction of a container port in Freeport and the purchase and refurbishing of three hotel complexes. **********In Panama, Hutchison Whampoa recently outbid American companies and secured the contracts to modernize and administer ports at either end of the Panama Canal. American officials have complained publicly that the bidding was marred by irregularities. **********''It is very hard to distinguish Hutchison Whampoa capital from mainland China capital,'' Mr. Chang, the Taiwanese Foreign Minister, said. ''Some people say we are using money to buy the region. That is not the case. It is mainland China who is doing this kind of thing, not us. But I think if they persist in this campaign against us, it is going to backfire against them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/15/business/phonetel-to-buy-communications-central.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-03-15", "snippet": "Phonetel Technologies Inc says it agreed to acquire Communications Central Inc for about $12.85 a share, or about $165 million in cash and debt (S)", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PHONETEL TO BUY COMMUNICATIONS CENTRAL", "print_headline": "PHONETEL TO BUY COMMUNICATIONS CENTRAL", "body_text": " **********Phonetel Technologies Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Communications Central Inc., an operator of public pay telephones, for about $12.85 a share, or about $165 million in cash and debt.

Just who is killing whom, and in what numbers, has become increasingly murky in Algeria. **********The Islamic Salvation Front, which has been banned since the last elections, urged Algerians today to boycott the elections for the 380-seat National Assembly. In a statement issued here, the party said a solution to Algeria's crisis could be found only through negotiation and ''national reconciliation.'' **********An earlier appeal from the party, issued last month and calling for a dialogue between the military rulers of Algeria and the now-jailed leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front has been met with silence by President Liamine Zeroual, a retired general who was elected in 1995. **********The extent of the Islamic Front's support in Algeria now seems much diminished, Western diplomats said, eroded by the savage violence of the guerrilla groups that split from it and took to killing artists, journalists, teachers, foreigners and whole village communities. But it remains uncertain whether a lasting peace in Algeria can be established without some negotiation with the party. **********Peace has been a central theme of the campaigns of the 39 parties and 7,000 candidates competing in the election. The parties include a newly formed movement, the National Democratic Rally, which is close to Mr. Zeroual and amounts to Algeria's new official political force, and a moderate Islamic party known as the Movement for a Peaceful Society, which has taken up some of the populist themes that won support for the Islamic Front. **********Those two parties, the only ones with a strong organization throughout the country, are widely expected to win the largest shares of the vote, with the National Democratic Rally enjoying a marked advantage. The Parliament is to be elected under a system of proportional representation for parties that win at least 5 percent of the vote. **********''I have visited the entire country in recent weeks and peace is the one thing people want,'' said Saddik Debaili, leader of the Front for Socialist Forces, an opposition party with its base in the Berber region east of Algiers. ''Unfortunately, the election amounts to the completion of the coup d'etat begun in 1992 and so is unlikely to provide the basis for peace.'' **********Mr. Debaili's argument is based on the fact that, unlike the vote of 1992, this election is being held under the terms of a Constitution that appears to create a veneer of democracy while insuring that real power remains with the military-backed President. The Constitution was approved last November, officially by 85.8 percent of the population, but Western officials say that vote was marked by pervasive fraud. **********No international observers were allowed to monitor the vote on the Constitution. But more than 100 observers, including 8 Americans, have been invited from the United Nations, the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity to monitor the parliamentary election. **********There are, though, more than 33,000 voting stations and Mr. Debaili, speaking in a telephone interview from Algiers, contended that fraud would again be widespread. **********Disillusionment with politics, fear of violence and general exhaustion among a population struggling with falling salaries have insured that the campaign up to now has been generally listless, said Mustapha Bouchachi, a prominent lawyer in Algiers. **********Under the Constitution, the Parliament will have severely curtailed powers. It is to be overseen by a Council of the Nation, one-third of whose members are to be picked by the President. Because any law proposed by Parliament will have to be approved by three-quarters of the Council of the Nation, the President will enjoy an effective veto over the legislature. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Zeroual's determination to win control of the Parliament is clear. The National Democratic Rally emerged abruptly in April and has enjoyed huge financing  and support from regional governments. More than 80 percent of its candidates have already held positions in the state apparatus, and several government ministers are candidates for the party. **********Despite rising oil prices, the country's economy remains mired in a slump that has left close to 30 pecent of the population unemployed. **********The Movement for a Peaceful Society, led by Mahfoud Nahnah, a former Arabic language teacher and imam, has tried to move into the void left by the banning of the Islamic Front. Formerly known as Hamas, but always a moderate movement, it has a strong grass-roots organization and is promising small business loans and shorter working hours for women. **********In recent weeks, the National Democratic Rally has strenuously attacked Mr. Nahnah. Referring to his imprisonment in the 1970's for the sabotage of telephone lines to protest widespread nationalization,  Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyatahia said, ''Those who cut down telephone poles laid the groundwork for those who now cut off heads.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/21/business/worldbusiness/IHT-lucky-break-underlies-stable-business-cycle.html": {"writer_name": "Carl Gewirtz", "pub_date": "1997-04-21", "snippet": "Why is this business cycle different from most others?

Club Mediterranee's shareholders have been so dissatisfied with the company's recent performance that in February, after last year's $130 million loss was announced, the chief executive, Serge Trigano, who is a son of the company's founder, was replaced by Philippe Bourguignon, the former head of Euro Disney. **********Industry officials say that confusion about the Club Med brand -- particularly over who vacations at the company's resorts, which it refers to as ''villages'' -- is partly responsible for Club Med's woes.

He said Club Med villages registered a ''marked increase'' last month in first-time vacationers, some of which could be attributed to the promotion. **********The tie-in with Calvin Klein Cosmetics, a unit of Unilever P.L.C., is aimed at single vacationers and entails a sweepstakes contest that promotes Escape perfumes for women and men and awards trips to villages monthly through next January. **********The sweepstakes is featured in two-page Escape ads with scent strips in the May and June issues of Details, Road and Track and People magazines; it is also being promoted at Escape counters in 1,300 stores around the nation.

The ads for this tie-in were created by CRK Advertising in New York, the in-house agency for the designer Calvin Klein. **********The alliance with Davidoff involves another sweepstakes, with the first prize a Club Med vacation for two plus a year's supply of Davidoff White Label cigars. The contest will be promoted this summer in 90 cigar stores in the United States and on the cigarshop.com World Wide Web site. The target here, Mr. Jordan said, is affluent ''consumers we don't usually talk to'' who might be interested in Club Med's more exotic villages. **********Mr. Jordan said the three programs together would cost $1 million to $2 million.

He also said  Mr. Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge regional commander, was afraid the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot would be brought to trial. **********''He did not want Pol Pot to be tried,'' Prince Ranariddh said, ''because if Pol Pot were tried, maybe Pol Pot would say that the hands of Mr. Hun Sen are as bloody as those of Pol Pot himself.'' **********By seizing power, the Prince said, Mr. Hun Sen will transform the Communist Khmer Rouge from a dying movement into a renewed fighting force. He said the guerrilla force that ruled Cambodia in a reign of terror that cost more than a million lives from 1975 until 1979 and then battled the Vietnamese-installed government that Mr. Hun Sen eventually led, would not let the coup stand. **********''Thanks to the coup, the Khmer Rouge will survive,'' Prince Ranariddh said. **********When Mr. Hun Sen took control  and declared Prince Ranariddh a traitor who would be brought to trial if he returned to Cambodia, Mr. Hun Sen leveled similar accusations of illegalities at his Co-Prime Minister.  The two were forced to share power in 1993 after an election that Prince Ranariddh's royalists won by a small majority, only to be threatened by violence by Mr. Hun Sen and his Communist Cambodian People's Party. **********The Prince, son of King Norodom Sihanouk, said working with Mr. Hun Sen over the last four years had been ''a nightmare.'' **********''I was trained in a liberal education,'' said Prince Ranariddh, 53, who graduated from the University of Aix-en-Provence and taught political science there from 1976 to 1983, when he took a leading role in his father's resistance movement against the Hun Sen Government. **********''I was the son of a King, part of a royal family. He was a student in Hanoi, a Stalinist. He was trained by Pol Pot. He was trained in a very tough manner, as a battalion commander, if I'm not mistaken.'' **********He described Mr. Hun Sen as ''irrational'' and unbalanced in their dealings. ''Sometimes he was violent, very violent,'' he said. ''He was very emotional, always changing his mind. But it was the formula that failed.'' **********''We, all together, for the sake of peace, accepted a very unworkable formula in 1993: one Government, two Prime Ministers,'' Prince Ranariddh said. ''And now we have seen that we have failed, completely failed.'' **********''We, all of us, betrayed the will of the Cambodian people,'' the Prince said, his voice at the breaking point. ''In a very courageous manner, the Cambodian people voted in 1993 to express their will to see Cambodia not only as a peaceful country but as a liberal and democratic country. That is why Cambodians voted for me and not the Communists.'' **********In a long statement distributed to Cambodian missions around the world this week, Mr. Hun Sen accused Prince Ranariddh of illegally negotiating with the Khmer Rouge and hiding some of their fighters in his Phnom Penh house and party headquarters. **********Mr. Hun Sen also said that the Prince had been illegally importing weapons, and had been involved in drug trafficking, the smuggling of ancient artifacts and fomenting ''social unrest and anarchy.'' **********Prince Ranariddh said Mr. Hun Sen's executions of royalist officials  in recent days had nothing to do with their efforts to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge, as diplomats have suggested, but rather with internal criminal investigations. This was particularly true in the case of Ho Sok, who was killed on Tuesday, he said. **********''Ho Sok had absolutely nothing to do with the Khmer Rouge,'' Prince Ranariddh said. Then, in a reference to the head of the faction believed to be holding Pol Pot, he added that Ho Sok ''was not part of the negotiations between me and Khieu Samphan.'' **********''But he was responsible -- he was appointed by me -- to investigate the trafficking of marijuana and other drugs,'' the Prince continued. ''That is the reason why he was assassinated.'' **********Prince Ranariddh accused Mong Rithi, Mr. Hun Sen's personal financial adviser, of being involved in drug trafficking as well as the trade in children for child prostitution. This year's United States Drug Enforcement Agency report on Cambodia does not mention politicians by name, but says Washington is setting up a national drug unit for Cambodia because the police had been ineffective in combating criminal activity and that political controversy was hampering anti-narcotics efforts. **********Prince Ranariddh said he had heard that Mr. Hun Sen had decided on June 11 as the date for the coup, but that it had been clear for months that he and his royalist party were  under threat. Some of the harrassment was public, including an attack on his residence. **********This followed a grenade attack on an Easter Sunday rally in Phnom Penh by Sam Rainsy, leader of the new Khmer Nation, in which 19 people died. Critics of Mr. Hun Sen have called this an assassination attempt  on Mr. Rainsy, who was gaining popularity. **********In Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, asked to look into the attack because of the presence of an American in the crowd, is nearing the conclusion that Mr. Hun Sen's bodyguards were involved. Cambodian journalists reported seeing police officers blocking rescue efforts. The United Nations has similar findings. **********Prince Ranariddh said he would go back to Cambodia to lead his royalist party, Funcinpec, in another election. But he added that he could not work with Mr. Hun Sen again and that he could not go to Cambodia now because of fears for his own safety. **********The Prince had meetings today with United Nations officials, including Secretary General Kofi Annan, and on Friday he is scheduled to meet in Washington with State Department officials and members of Congress. **********As today's meetings were taking place, the United States announced that it was suspending this year's $35 million aid to Cambodia for 30 days, in what the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, characterized as ''a very hard line'' with Mr. Hun Sen. Also today, in a major rebuff, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, decided to delay Cambodia's admission to the group. **********Prince Ranariddh said he would have four requests in his meetings. **********He wants diplomatic pressure put on Mr. Hun Sen, who he says has violated the 1991 Paris peace agreement that led to the United Nations-supervised elections in 1993. He wants governments and international organizations to put an aid freeze on Cambodia to demonstrate that coups carry a cost. He is seeking a mediator's role for King Sihanouk, now in Beijing for medical treatment. And, finally, he wants new elections. **********There is no time to spare, he said. **********''My followers in Phnom Penh and in the countryside are now the subjects of one of the most terrible repression coming from Hun Sen,'' he said. ''People are much more than frightened. It is back to the very totalitarian, Pol Potist style. The repression will be terrible, and the implementation will be terrible. I feel very, very sad for my country.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/15/business/banco-popular-of-spain-says-profit-rose-6.1.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-01-15", "snippet": "Banco Popular SA reports 1996 net rose 6.1 percent, to $459 million (US) (S)", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Banco Popular of Spain Says Profit Rose 6.1%", "print_headline": "Banco Popular of Spain Says Profit Rose 6.1%", "body_text": " **********Banco Popular S.A., Spain's fourth-largest commercial bank, said yesterday that profit in 1996 rose 6.1 percent, to 61 billion pesetas ($459 million), as falling interest rates put pressure on loan revenue. **********The rise in profit was in line with the 6.2 percent increase in earnings in the first nine months, though at the low end of analysts' estimates for the full year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/27/your-money/IHT-briefcase-2-german-giants-make-us-debut-with-adrs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-09-27", "snippet": "Two giants of German industry are making their debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

Peter Blair of Salomon Brothers Inc. in London is one of several who has Hoechst on his \"buy\" list. **********\"It's a company in transformation,\" he said, noting that it was moving out of the low-return commodity chemicals business, and building its profitable pharmaceutical, agro-chemical and animal health divisions. \"Hoechst's pharmaceutical business was number five in the world last year, but it is still viewed as a chemicals company, so there's hidden value there.\" **********The restructuring is holding back earnings right now, but the payoff is coming, Mr. Blair said. By the year 2000, he sees Hoechst's earnings per share at 6.20 Deutsche marks ($3.50), more than double last year's 2.80 DM.

Only \"poorly managed conglomerates\" need fear corporate raiders, he said. **********Veba's telecommunications unit also needs a partner to help it compete in Germany's opening market, Mr. Schumacher said.

There is even a trainer with a degree in exercise physiology to guide him through his workouts. **********Carmella Edelman has little use for the treadmills, but she has become a regular at the store for its cooking school, across from the aisle where Maybelline mascara and Stephen King paperbacks are sold. For about $30 -- food included -- students learn to whip up duck ravioli with brown butter sauce, chocolate-chip biscotti and other such delights. **********Is your driver's license about to expire? You can renew it at the store's customer service counter. Other chains are offering sushi bars and shoe repair, or providing baby-sitting while harried parents shop. **********All this, of course, is intended to lure people into supermarkets, and not just to tighten abs or teach customers to stir-fry. Once they're inside, the grocery store of the 90's is designed to get shoppers not only to buy toothpaste and cereal but also to fill their carts with high-margin convenience items like boneless, skinless, marinaded chicken breasts. Behind the scenes, meanwhile, store operators are working to shave pennies off the cost of stocking chicken-noodle soup and other staples that add little to their bottom lines. **********The goal is to push razor-thin profits closer to 2 percent than 1 percent, which is about all that even the best operators have been able to achieve in the supermarket industry. That challenge is attracting some of the smartest money in the United States and Europe to a business rarely regarded as innovative. It is forcing supermarket operators to spend billions of dollars remodeling outdated stores and investing in technology. And it is driving already big chains into the arms of larger, more powerful merger partners. **********THE food fight in Atlanta is a microcosm of what is happening across the country -- especially in growing cities where chains can plant huge superstores amid newly sprouted suburban subdivisions, in hopes of cashing in on robust economies, relatively cheap land and rapid population growth. **********With profits so slim, the chase is do or die, and Atlanta's market is especially competitive. Some grocers in this city, which in the 1990's has had among the highest rates of store openings and new market entrants in the country, have already been driven out. And there are likely to be more casualties  when the economy inevitably slows. **********''The square footage that is going in there is just mind-boggling,'' said Bonni Zwickel, an industry analyst for First Boston, surveying the Atlanta market. ''Second- or third-tier players just have to fall out at some point.'' **********The reason for the industry's attempts to remake itself? Investors are demanding better returns at a time supermarket companies are losing business to unlikely competitors that now stock grocery items. Toys ''R'' Us sells diapers and baby formula. Wal-Mart is counted as the fifth-biggest supermarket chain in America. And many baby boomers would rather buy Boston Market's take-out meals than supermarket frozen dinners or -- of all things -- the ingredients to actually cook a meal. **********''The line between grocery retailers and other kinds of retailers continues to blur,'' said Paul Bernish, a spokesman for the Kroger Company in Cincinnati, which at $25 billion in sales is the nation's largest grocery chain. ''Without us taking action and becoming smarter ourselves, we face the possibility of losing our place in consumers' minds.'' **********In Atlanta, the competition is visible in bickering over ads and promotions, battles for prime real estate and a proliferation of store concepts that may not pay off. What, after all, does Kroger really know about the fitness business? In the Alpharetta store, it did cruelly plant the gym just a few feet from the bakery. **********Despite the risk that some of their efforts will flop, the dozen or so competitors here are undaunted. Kroger relies on service -- offering, for instance, dry-cleaning at some stores. A struggling local chain, Harry's Farmers Market, pulls in customers from 20 miles away with the most extensive product assortment in town, everything from fresh fish heads to $100-an-ounce balsamic vinegar. Winn-Dixie has positioned itself as the bargain shopper's alternative, advertising cheap wine and beef. Publix has simply bullied its way into the $6 billion Atlanta market, spending more than $300 million to open about 60 stores in five years. **********The aisles are becoming crowded in other cities, too. In Houston and Dallas, Albertson's and Kroger have displaced Houston-based Randall's as the market leader by rapidly expanding with new or revamped stores. And Safeway, in which the New York takeover firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has a one-third stake, bought a leading chunk of the Southern California market last year when it acquired the Vons Companies. **********Other deals include the purchase of Stop & Shop Companies by Ahold N.V., a Dutch company, and the acquisition of Kash n' Karry Food Stores by Food Lion. In addition, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts recently purchased the Bruno's chain, continuing its spree of buying undervalued grocery companies with strong turnaround prospects. **********THE push to create larger regional chains is reshaping competition from Phoenix to Charlotte to Seattle, although parts of the Northeast have lagged behind the trend. The New York City area is an especially tough market that many operators avoid altogether because of its shortage of vacant land, high real estate and labor costs and zoning barriers. **********Even in New York, though, there have been changes. Stop & Shop is adding amenities in stores in Westchester County, including banks, pharmacies and expanded bakeries in some stores. Pathmark Stores is also upgrading and expanding. The company is building a store in Harlem and has said it will add bank branches in dozens of its New York stores. **********In the growth markets, however, consumers have come to expect even more variety, increased service and lower prices. While shoppers may judge the industry by the number of stores near their homes that have sushi bars, the real gauges of success have more to do with factors far from shoppers' view -- in produce coolers, warehouses and corporate offices. **********For example, customers at Kroger stores in Atlanta may think it is a coincidence when cashiers hand them coupons offering 50 cents off their favorite brand -- and flavor -- of ice cream. But scanners that tally their food bills at the checkout counters are simultaneously analyzing what they buy. This technology, growing in popularity among the chains, is being rolled out at hundreds of Kroger stores. **********The checkout data allow stores to instantly print coupons for items being purchased (or for similar products) and to electronically reorder merchandise as it sells. Because the promotions are linked to the inventory, fewer cases of soda collect dust in warehouses. **********Kroger, citing competitive reasons, declined to say how much money it was saving through its technology investments and other cost-cutting measures. Industrywide, though, such improvements can make the difference between turning a profit or reporting a loss as supermarket sales remain flat. **********THE industry's revenues, excluding sales from warehouse clubs and convenience stores, increased 11 percent last year, to $323.2 billion. But sales actually declined slightly after adjusting for inflation, according to Progressive Grocer, a trade publication. **********At the same time, the industry's operating expenses declined last year to 96.95 percent of sales, from 97.90 percent in 1995, according to the Food Marketing Institute, a trade group. Minute as that may seem, it was substantial for an industry that counts its profits in fractions of a penny: it contributed $3 billion to pretax profits, helping net income rise to 1.2 percent of sales from 1.14 percent in 1995 and a low of 0.49 percent in 1993, according to the marketing institute. **********Surprisingly, the value of supermarket stocks, which have always trailed the broader market, is still in the cellar. Food retailers' shares, as measured by the Standard & Poor's food retail index, rose 8.6 percent so far this year, versus the 21.4 percent gain for the 500 stocks in the broader S.& P. index. Part of the reason for the disparity is that the payoff from the big chains' costly investments is just beginning to show up on balance sheets; in addition, while supermarkets are becoming more efficient, many still suffer from heavy debts accumulated in leveraged buyouts during the 80's and early 90's. **********The attraction is that even with skimpy margins, large, well-run chains can turn in respectable profits. Kroger's net profit margin, for instance, was just 1.39 percent last year, but that translates into a decent $350 million on sales of $25 billion. **********Analysts say profitability should continue to edge up for the overall industry, between further cost-cutting and consolidations that are trimming purchasing, administrative, distribution and advertising expenses and giving grocers more clout with their suppliers. **********The industry makeover and the increased competition is fine by Ms. Edelman, the Roswell, Ga., woman who attends the Kroger cooking school in Alpharetta. She frequents several stores, depending on her needs. For recipe ingredients after class, she shops at Kroger. ''But actually, for my produce, I go to Harry's Market,'' she said. **********Already, the struggle to win the loyalty of customers like Ms. Edelman is taking a toll on some grocers. Winn-Dixie, long the No. 2 chain in Atlanta, behind Kroger, fell last year to third place, the victim of an assault on the market by Publix, a Lakeland, Fla., chain closely held by its employees. **********SIX years ago, when Ed Crenshaw, then a Publix executive vice president, pulled out his corporate credit card at a car rental agency in Atlanta, the clerk asked, ''What is Publix?'' and wanted to know if the name was spelled incorrectly. **********''We knew we would have to do a lot of work to develop the brand up here,'' said Mr. Crenshaw, now president of the company. So when Publix, looking to expand after saturating its home state, blew into Atlanta in 1991, the company simply offered what it determined was missing: newer, cleaner stores, more service and fresher perishable goods. In just five years, Publix claimed 14.4 percent of the Atlanta market. **********''We know how to make money,'' said Frank Hernandez, regional director for Publix in Atlanta. ''Once you give people something of value, they will come back. We are not trying be something other than a food business, so we don't want to have a smorgasbord of things in a food store and then let customers forget about food and the essential things that we built this business on.'' **********Customers say the approach is working. ''I used to shop at A.& P., but I got disappointed with their produce,'' said Veronique Maitre, a translator who was shopping recently at the Publix store in Alpharetta. ''They were out, or it didn't look good.'' **********Another shopper, Marie Vitalo has become a regular at Publix even though there is a Winn-Dixie store about a block from her house in Smyrna. **********''I like a clean, big store,'' said Ms. Vitalo, who works in accounting. **********Winn-Dixie, meanwhile, is determined to use pricing to win back customers like Ms. Vitalo. The parking lot of its Alpharetta store, which competes with two nearby Krogers and one of Wal-Mart's Sam's Club warehouse stores, is festooned with a large blue-and-white banner promising ''Lowest prices in town.'' Inside the store, signs and tags create a virtual sea of markdowns. The signs announce 40 percent off greeting cards, 50 percent off sunglasses, 15 percent off national-brand snack chips and 20 percent off school supplies. Some signs ask simply: ''Why pay more?'' **********''We are in a transition and have been for many years,'' said Mickey Clerk, a spokesman for Winn-Dixie, based in Jacksonville, Fla. ''Customers are stretched for time as well as for money, and what they want to do is find everything they want at the lowest prices they can in one place that is convenient for them. We were convenient before, but we didn't have the complete variety that today's customers want.'' **********So the company is closing stores throughout its system that are less than 30,000 square feet and replacing them with larger ones -- some up to 70,000 square feet -- with room for floral departments, pharmacies and bigger delis. **********A strategy of low prices and big investments may not seem like a smart game plan in one of Winn-Dixie's most competitive markets. But the chain has the resources to wait for weaker operators to fold; meanwhile, it continues to improve its stores to be more competitive with Kroger and Publix. **********Some competitors, though, have simply left or are struggling to keep up. Four years ago, Big Star, one of the retail arms of Fleming Companies, the giant food wholesaler, sold its Atlanta stores to A.& P. and left the market. Yet A.& P., which has been slow to upgrade its network of older stores, is barely clinging to sixth place in the market. **********''We were really consolidating,'' said Michael Rourke, a senior vice president of A.& P. ''A lot of stores we acquired were not up to today's standard and had to be closed.'' **********Grand Union and Piggly Wiggly supermarkets have also sold their Atlanta stores to other competitors, while Harry's Farmers Market, with five stores, hangs on, but has lost more than $23 million in four years. **********Even the market leaders have some housecleaning to do. An older Kroger store in the fashionable Buckhead section of Atlanta has dated fixtures and lacks the amenities found in the Alpharetta outlet. **********Such shortcomings are becoming less tolerable to Atlanta-area shoppers. Mr. McFarland, who works out at the ''cardiotheater'' in the Alpharetta Kroger, said he had noticed an overall improvement in the area's supermarkets in recent years, as more companies moved in. **********Besides the gym, which is run by Australian Body Works and costs $5 a visit for walk-ins, Mr. McFarland uses the pharmacy and the Nationsbank branch at the store.

The move provided a gain for bondholders led by Carl C. Icahn. But the struggle is far from over. **********Toy Biz, a company partly owned by Marvel, has an exclusive license to develop toys based on Marvel comic book characters. It had been a key part of efforts first by Ronald O. Perelman, the financier who previously controlled Marvel, and then by Marvel's management and bank lenders, to reorganize the bankrupt company on terms that would leave holders of Marvel bonds and stock with only a very small stake in the company. **********But yesterday, Toy Biz said it had reached a deal with Marvel bondholders, led by Mr. Icahn, for a merger with Marvel on terms satisfactory to the bondholders. The move came a day after Toy Biz backed out of a deal with Marvel's management and banks. **********''We hope this will finally resolve the Chapter 11 of Marvel Entertainment and revitalize this great company to get Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk and all the other great characters moving in the right direction again,'' Mr. Icahn said. **********While Mr. Icahn spoke of a consensus, the battle continues. The agreement was announced just before a bankruptcy judge began a hearing on whether to block the bondholder group from throwing out Marvel's board. **********Without the court's intervention, the bondholder group can do so because its bonds are secured by 80 percent of Marvel's stock, owned by Mr. Perelman, and the bondholders have gotten legal permission to seize that collateral. The judge issued no immediate ruling yesterday, and a Federal district judge later in the day ordered that no such move be made until a new hearing is held on Tuesday. **********Bank lenders, led by Chase Manhattan, oppose the bondholders' plan, contending that what they would get -- $300 million in cash or notes plus the Marvel subsidiaries Fleer, Sky Box and Panini, which sell sporting cards and stickers -- is too little. **********The banks have the option to oppose the plan in bankruptcy court, and, if the court agrees that the banks are being disadvantaged, the plan could be rejected. **********Under the plan, owners of Toy Biz would get 40 percent of the stock in the combined entity. Owners of Marvel, including the bondholders, would get 60 percent, but only after paying $200 million for additional equity through a rights offering. In addition, the rights offering would raise $100 million to $300 million by selling bonds, with the exact amount dependent on whether the banks end up getting notes or cash. **********In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, shares of Marvel rose 12.5 cents, to $2.25, and those of Toy Biz rose 75 cents, to $9.375."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/16/business/at-the-gate-a-ticket-to-the-fast-lanes-of-money-management.html": {"writer_name": "Virginia Kahn", "pub_date": "1997-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1416, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Ticket to the Fast Lanes Of Money Management", "print_headline": "AT THE GATE; A Ticket to the Fast Lanes Of Money Management", "body_text": " **********INVESTORS looking to ride the wave of mergers sweeping the money management business can look forward to getting a new vehicle this week. Affiliated Managers Group, a company whose main business is buying money managers like the mutual fund firm Tweedy, Browne, is scheduled to sell shares to the public on Thursday. **********The offering represents the first opportunity for investors to gain exposure to a company associated with the money management business since 1992 when the St. Paul Companies sold 20 percent of the John Nuveen Company to the public. Since then, Nuveen stock has appreciated 100 percent. **********As a group, the stocks of companies that manage money for individuals and institutions have risen 130 percent since October 1994, compared with 94 percent for the market, according to an index of 14 money management stocks compiled by Putnam Lovell & Thornton, an investment banking firm that specializes in financial services companies. **********Given this performance and the lack of new offerings in the field, some analysts expect the Affiliated Managers offering by underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company to be well received. **********''We think there will be very strong interest in this offering,'' said Kathleen Smith, portfolio manager at Renaissance Capital, a firm in Greenwich, Conn., that researches and invests in initial public offerings. ''The fact is there isn't too much else out there.'' **********But other analysts are more cautious. ''It's tough to gauge,'' said Ryan Jacob, director of research at IPO Value Monitor, a research firm. But, he added, ''This won't be a hot deal.'' **********The strategy of Affiliated Managers is to buy majority interests in midsize money management firms and to profit by increasing its assets under management through these acquisitions and through the affiliates' internal growth. **********So far, the company has done a good job of acquiring its fair share of affiliates, said John Cabell, portfolio co-manager at the USAA Aggressive Growth fund and a potential investor. Since its founding in December 1993, Affiliated Managers has acquired 10 money management firms that oversee $43 billion in assets. Among the 10 are Skyline Asset Management, manager of the Skyline Special Equities and Skyline Special Equities II mutual funds, and First Quadrant, a  large quantitative investment firm that  uses computers in asset allocation and style management strategies. **********During the summer, the company scored its biggest coup by lassoing the Tweedy, Browne Company, which manages two top-rated mutual funds -- Tweedy, Browne American Value and Global Value -- as well as private money. With its $300 million price and $5.1 billion in assets, the deal gave Affiliated Managers credibility as a buyer of good-sized firms. **********''A pillar like Tweedy, Browne will attract other managers,'' Mr. Cabell said. **********In fact, the company has been mentioned as a potential buyer of Insight Management, the company founded by the Fidelity watcher and money manager Eric M. Kobren. That deal could be valued at up to $200 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. **********The biggest risk to the company is in its dependence on a favorable investment environment and a continuing flow of cash into mutual funds and other money management vehicles. If the stock market has a down year, companies that earn fees based on assets under management could see revenues suffer. **********''The offering seems to be fair,'' Mr. Jacob said, ''but investors need to understand they're taking market risk.'' **********Affiliated Managers, which is headed by William J. Nutt, former president of the Boston Company, an institutional money manager, is offering seven million shares of common stock, expected to be priced at $20 to $23 each. The proceeds will go toward paying down $139 million in debt. **********That will leave $206 million in long-term debt, but shareholders' equity will rise to $214.8 million. That relationship between debt and equity is reasonable, considering the fairly stable flow of asset management fees, analysts said. **********Given the likely institutional interest, the stock is expected to begin trading at a 16 percent premium to its offer price, said David Menlow, president of IPO Financial Network, which projects opening premiums on initial offerings. ''That's a good pop at the opening, but investors should be in this for the long term,'' he added. **********Financial services stocks typically do not provide investors with quick profits, he and others said, and Affiliated Managers is just turning the corner on profitability. The company earned $833,000 in the first nine months of 1997 after posting losses in each of the previous three years. **********Analysts expect the company to remain profitable. Earnings should increase 17 percent to 20 percent a year over the next two to three years, Ms. Smith estimated. **********The company motivates its affiliates to grow by leaving 25 percent to 45 percent of ownership in management's hands. Affiliated Managers contends that this structure is superior to that used by its closest rival for deals, United Asset Management, which typically buys 100 percent of a company. U.A.M.'s practice ''eliminates the possibility of disputes in valuing the minority share when it changes hands,'' said Jonathan Hubbard, U.A.M.'s manager of media relations. Mr. Hubbard added that U.A.M. provides its managers with other incentives, like revenue sharing and stock options, that allow them to share in their firm's growth. **********BECAUSE more than 1,200 companies in the United States and abroad have assets under management in its target range of $500 million to $10 billion, Affiliated Managers maintains that there are plenty of deals to be done. **********Many such firms got their start after the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which created a need for professional management of pension funds. Their founders now face succession and liquidity issues, and Affiliated Managers provides a way to turn their investment in their businesses into cash to help in estate planning. **********Money managers at large firms also continue to set up shop on their own. Last year, the number of start-ups and so-called lift-outs -- in which groups of employees leave to join other firms -- exceeded acquisitions by 60 to 49, according to Investment Counseling Inc. of West Conshohocken, Pa. **********But Affiliated Managers is not the only company that has noticed this trend. Since its founding in 1980, U.A.M. has acquired 50 money management firms. Today, its firms manage $207 billion in assets. While shares of U.A.M. have been under pressure recently, it has provided compound returns of 14.02 percent a year since going public in 1986. **********Bradford I. Hearsh, managing director in the financial institutions group at Paine Webber, counts a half-dozen other firms that aim to invest in midsize money management companies. Among these are Value Asset Management, which is backed by a unit of BankBoston, and Matrix Capital Management, backed by Castle Harlan, the New York merchant bank. **********''There is a lot of fragmentation and owners seeking liquidity, which brings money out of the woodwork,'' Mr. Hearsh said. The price multiples being paid for money management firms in the midsize range have risen 23 percent since 1993, from 7.7 times cash flow to 9.5 times, according to data compiled by Putnam Lovell & Thornton. **********As for the internal growth of its affiliates,  Affiliated Managers has experienced ''nice increases in inflows of assets and performance'' so far this year, Ms. Smith said. **********But it is still early in the game, Mr. Hearsh cautioned. ''You have to believe that these holding companies can add value -- that managers can grow more quickly with A.M.G.,'' he said. ''This is still an open issue.'' **********There are other risks, analysts said. Affiliated Managers is highly dependent on its newest acquisition, Tweedy, Browne. If it were included in financial statements for the first six months of the year, its cash flows would account for 52 percent of the cash flows that Affiliated Managers receives from affiliates. **********''The big question going forward is what is Tweedy, Browne going to do,'' Ms. Smith said. The company has established solid long-term performance records and is extremely profitable, earning $21.8 million on $33.6 million in revenues before the partners took their profits last year. As Ms. Smith sees it, the offering ''sinks or swims on Tweedy, Browne.'' **********The offering remains attractive, however, to an investor like Mr. Cabell of USAA. ''If the equity markets continue to prosper, and I see no reason why Asia should be a problem,'' he said, ''this is a good way to participate in the money management business.'' **********Those who take a less sanguine view of the markets, however, like George Shirk, managing editor at New Issues, a newsletter based in Deerfield Beach, Fla., are more cautious. ''We just don't see the fundamentals in place for an investment advisory firm to excel in an overextended market,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/29/world/alexandria-journal-down-among-the-sewage-cleopatra-s-storied-city.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Jehl", "pub_date": "1997-10-29", "snippet": "French archeological team is working amid untreated sewage in eastern harbor of Alexandria, Egypt, uncovering sunken remnants of ancient royal quarter that housed rulers, including Cleopatra, 1,600 years ago; remnants are being discovered within 1...", "word_count": 1004, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Alexandria Journal; Down Among the Sewage, Cleopatra's Storied City", "print_headline": "Alexandria Journal; Down Among the Sewage, Cleopatra's Storied City", "body_text": " **********The poet called it a wine-dark sea, but here the Mediterranean is obscured by something less poetic. **********It is sewage that flows untreated into coastal water. Beneath the surface of the once-fabled eastern harbor, it is rarely possible to see more than an arm's length away, a dismal reflection of the faded city that modern Alexandria has become. **********That is what makes it understandable -- but still nothing short of remarkable -- that only now, some 1,600 years after it slipped into the sea, the remnants of an ancient quarter that housed rulers including Cleopatra are being discovered within 100 yards of what is now the shoreline, in water just 15 feet deep. **********Along with modern filth, the centuries had collaborated to give the artifacts a hiding place, burying columns, statues and giant granite blocks deep beneath the sand or encrusting them in thick layers of a shell-like coating. **********In the past, those who searched the harbor had been able to find nothing, but that has changed with the use of technology that has enabled explorers to see through the gloom. **********''Where other people saw only rocks, we have been able to assemble a true picture,'' said Franck Goddio, a Frenchman whose team has used advanced magnetometers, radar and other devices to produce what Egyptian officials call a revolution in underwater archeology. **********What has been found so far -- sphinxes, pedestals and other artifacts, some with Greek inscriptions -- has substituted hard evidence for years of speculation about the layout of the ancient quarter, the heart of what in the three centuries before Christ was one of the most important cities in the world. **********But to unearth, clean, photograph and catalogue the artifacts, divers must still spend hours at work each day on the harbor floor, where the outflow of sewage from what has become a city of five million people can be felt as a detectable current. **********For perhaps a few hours every 15 days, the flow is shut down, and ''then you can really feel a difference,'' said Susan Henrickson, an American who is among the divers whose work within shouting distance of Alexandria's traffic-clogged corniche is painting a new picture of the city's former splendor. **********Accounts from the time have described the royal quarter as a walled city of splendid, lavish buildings and magnificent parks that made up about a third of the total area of the city, which was founded in 331 B.C. by Alexander the Great. **********But its most majestic years ended in 30 B.C., when the defeat of Cleopatra's forces in the battle of Actium transformed Egypt into a Roman province. And during the great earthquake and tidal wave that struck the city in the fourth century A.D., the royal quarter vanished. **********That left even its layout to be debated among scholars unable to uncover what the accounts say were a Ptolemaic palace, Mark Antony's Timonium, and temples of Isis and Poseidon. **********Cleopatra was the last of the Ptolemies, the dynasty of Egyptian rulers of Macedonian descent that was established after Alexander's death. Because she was among those who ruled from the royal quarter, Mr. Goddio's team has sometimes been hailed as having discovered Cleopatra's Palace. That very name conjures up those famous cinematic images of a powerful, seductive queen, her lover Julius Caesar and her suicide along with another lover, Mark Antony, in the aftermath of the Roman triumph. **********In fact, scholars say it is almost certainly too soon to tell which of the red granite, basalt, marble and limestone blocks that Mr. Goddio and his team are painstakingly mapping, photographing and cataloguing on the gloomy harbor floor might have been part of any particular structure. **********''We are excavating a town in which Cleopatra lived, but to this day there are no remains that can be precisely identified with her,'' said Dr. Manfred Clauss, a German expert on Cleopatra and professor of ancient history at Goethe University who is providing advice on the project. **********For researchers, an additional problem beyond the fact that the relics are underwater is that they must almost certainly remain there. After being sodden for so long in brine, even the hardest of stone cannot withstand being exposed to the air unless it is first painstakingly desalted, a process that can take as long as two years. **********At least for the indefinite future, Mr. Goddio and his team have agreed with Egypt's Supreme Council on Antiquities that everything found will remain beneath the surface, where it is cleaned, examined, photographed and mapped, under the supervision of Egyptian archeologists. **********Even for an object as small as a four-foot-long sphinx, the process can be painstaking, taking a team of two divers as long as a week just to pick away the deposits that encase just about everything on the harbor floor. **********And although special lights and ultra-wide-angle lenses make it possible to photograph most of the finds even in the underwater gloom, the team has had to come up with other techniques to record evidence that is less easy to see. **********With its financial sponsor, the Hilti Foundation, a private philanthropy based in Liechtenstein, Mr. Goddio's team has even developed a latex coating that has been used to lift away exact copies of otherwise indecipherable Greek inscriptions, thereby helping to date certain underwater finds. **********In hopeful moments, afloat off Alexandria, Mr. Goddio and his divers say they can almost imagine the day when the harbor might somehow be made pristine. They say they would wish for the creation of a kind of archeological theme park, where tourists could float in glass-bottom boats and gaze down at all that has been uncovered. **********But then they gesture across the water toward the crowded, dirty city, and say they recognize that they will have to be satisfied with much, much less. **********''They promised us last year that the sewage would stop in March, but nothing has changed,'' a diver who insisted on anonymity said of the Egyptian authorities. ''Now they say it will stop by the end of 1998. It's great to uncover antiquity, but it would sure be better without all this modern muck.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/18/world/albanian-refugees-in-italy-are-in-a-kind-of-crowded-limbo.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1997-03-18", "snippet": "Italian port of Brindisi is experiencing flood of Albanian refugees, creating quandry for local officials as to how to care for them; number has swelled from about 300 to 6,000 in past three days; estimates of Albanian refugees in Italy as whole a...", "word_count": 619, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Albanian Refugees in Italy Are in a Kind of Crowded Limbo", "print_headline": "Albanian Refugees in Italy Are in a Kind of Crowded Limbo", "body_text": " **********Three days into the latest exodus of Albanians to Italy's southeast coast, this ancient port city has run out of room. **********On Friday, the number of refugees here was about 300; today it reached 3,000, not counting the latest arrival, an aging military frigate carrying about 900 people that ran out of fuel about 23 miles outside the harbor. **********All but about 120 of the ship's occupants were taken aboard an Italian ship and ferried north to the larger city of Bari, under armed guard. **********''We are completely full,'' explained Pietro Antonacci, the deputy police chief here in Brindisi, ticking off a list of 18 settlement centers commandeered since the weekend, including hotels, church centers, sports camps and nursery schools.

Working through the night, they cleaned up an old nursery school that had been vacant for three years. **********Now the school is the temporary home of 40 Albanians, among them Nuredin Lejla and his family.

''Everywhere people were running because they were afraid.'' **********In normal times, a ferry takes about five hours to travel from Durres to Brindisi. But the Lejla family, together with about 70 others, piled onto what they described as a tugboat for a journey that lasted three days. For one thing, no one on board was much of a sailor, let alone a captain; Mr. Lejla, as a mechanic, had the most experience with boats. **********At one point in the middle of the night, the engine broke down, and they were stalled until another ship could come along and start it up again. The nights were cold, and the sailing was not smooth. **********''Everyone was sick the whole way,'' said Ada Lejla, 15, who was a student at a language school in Tirana. ''When we saw the lights of Brindisi, we were so happy.'' **********The boat was pulled into Brindisi harbor at dawn on Friday, and by the next day, the family and many of their fellow passengers had settled into the village nursery school, where hot meals are brought to them three times a day. **********''We want to stay, but we don't know if the Italians want us to stay,'' Ada said. **********They are in limbo, with temporary papers, a place to sleep, food to eat but no money, and for the moment, no prospects. Those Albanian refugees with relatives already in Italy who will come here to collect them are free to go; others can slip away, but not many have anywhere to slip away to, or the means to do it. **********Already, 650 refugees have been bused to other parts of Italy, to relieve the pressure on southern regions that already have high unemployment. **********The Italian authorities are offering assistance to the new arrivals, but not so much as to encourage more of them to come. On a visit to Brindisi on Sunday, the Italian Prime Minister, Romano Prodi, sent a clear message across the Adriatic when he said Albanians would not solve their problems by fleeing.

Second, and more significant, tight labor markets seem likely to result in larger wage increases and more rapidly rising labor costs, which are then likely to make their way into consumer prices and somewhat higher inflation. **********As a result, WEFA forecast that the Fed's target for the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, will be increased to 6 percent from 5.50 percent by year-end and to 6.50 percent by the middle of next year. **********Elsewhere, the Treasury announced the size of its two-year and five-year note auctions for next week. On Tuesday the Government will sell $15.5 billion of new two-year maturities and on Wednesday, $11.5 billion of notes with a five-year maturity. In when-issued trading ahead of the auctions, the two-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.02 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.28 percent. **********Today the Treasury will sell $13 billion of new one-year bills through auction. By late yesterday, the rate of a one-year bill was 5.32 percent. **********In the municipal bond market, prices were little changed as states and local governments sold a total of about $2.3 billion of new securities, led by Los Angeles County's $1.3 billion of one-year tax and revenue anticipation notes through Merrill Lynch. The notes were tentatively priced to yield 3.8 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/27/business/deutsche-bank-sets-fund-for-irregularities.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-03-27", "snippet": "Deutsche Bank AG reports setting aside $710 million in 1996 to reimburse customers and pay potential fines arising from previously disclosed irregularities by fund manager at its Morgan Grenfell Asset Management unit (S)", "word_count": 209, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deutsche Bank Sets Fund for Irregularities", "print_headline": "Deutsche Bank Sets Fund for Irregularities", "body_text": " **********Deutsche Bank A.G. said today that it set aside 1.2 billion marks, or $710 million, last year to reimburse customers and pay potential fines arising from the previously disclosed irregularities by a fund manager at its Morgan Grenfell Asset Management subsidiary. **********The bank, Europe's largest, said the costs associated with Morgan Grenfell, as well as restructuring costs, weighed down 1996 net income, which rose 4.6 percent, to 2.218 billion marks.

Silverman, chairman and chief executive of what is now HFS Inc., has been unrelenting in the pursuit of two goals: expanding access to consumers by acquiring new franchises and driving the stock price higher. **********On both counts, he has so far been remarkably successful. By agreeing to merge with CUC International Inc., analysts said, HFS has made a bold move to insure that it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. **********''This transaction will enable both companies to maintain an unusually high rate of growth for longer than each would have been able to achieve independently,'' said Michael Rietbrock, an analyst with Smith Barney. **********Through an aggressive acquisition strategy, Mr. Silverman has assembled an empire that consists of a loose confederation of brands in related services: rental cars and hotels, real estate and mortgages. **********The string of franchises, put together over the last seven years through the acquisition of such properties as Super 8 Motels and Villager Lodge, Coldwell Banker and Century 21 Real Estate and Avis Inc., has generated mushrooming growth for HFS and earned it dedicated fans on Wall Street. **********Last year, the company earned $169.6 million, a 113 percent increase from 1995 net income. Revenue increased 93 percent, to $799 million. **********''HFS has a phenomenal collection of consumer platforms,'' said Neil Barsky, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. ''And over the last five years, Henry Silverman has been one of the greatest creators of shareholder value. No chief executive I know of has done a better job of that.'' **********Few could dispute that last assertion: since its initial public offering in December 1992, at $4 a share, the price of HFS stock, after adjusting for splits, has risen fortyfold. The stock, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed yesterday before the announcement of the merger at $59, up $2. **********So far this year, Mr. Silverman had shown no sign of changing his strategy: he has struck a deal with the Hilton Hotels Corporation to acquire the franchising rights to Sheraton Hotels should Hilton succeed in its $6.5 billion hostile takeover bid for the ITT Corporation. **********HFS is also said to be in talks to buy the Signature Group, a direct marketing business, from the Montgomery Ward Holding Corporation for more than $1 billion in cash. **********Even as HFS rapidly builds its consumer businesses, it is still trying to figure out how to sell one franchisee's wares to the customer of another franchisee, analysts said, to get a Ramada Inn customer, for example, to rent a car from Avis. **********Mr. Silverman agreed. **********''From our standpoint, we were having difficulty in fully exploiting our capabilities,'' he said yesterday. **********CUC, on the other hand, reaches around 68 million consumers through its discount clubs, and is a company ''that truly knows how to market to consumers,'' Mr. Barsky, the Morgan Stanley analyst, said. **********''It would have taken HFS years to develop the skills that CUC already has,'' Mr. Barsky said. ''This merger accelerates HFS's business plan by several years.'' **********Indeed, even though the merger was billed as a marriage of equals, and Mr. Silverman and Walter A. Forbes, CUC's chairman and chief executive, will take turns running the merged company as president and chief executive, analysts are assuming Mr. Silverman will be first among equals. **********What was hailed as a bold strategic move might look somewhat different if the creator of HFS turned his attentions elsewhere. **********''It is very important to the Street that Henry remain active in the business,'' Mr. Rietbrock from Smith Barney said.

It will be strong and in demand and will be included in national reserves. Since 1980, the proportion of the dollar in world reserves has fallen and the share of the European currencies has increased, so the euro will continue a movement that is already there.\" **********Along with Denmark and Sweden, Britain has said it will not join the first wave of countries joining the euro, and Greece is unlikely to meet the criteria for membership. But although they will be excluded from a proposed council of euro members, Mr. de Silguy said, \"exactly the same rules will apply to the first and subsequent waves.\" **********In any event, he said, Britain played an active role in the planning and preparation for the euro and will hold the presidency of the EU in the first half of next year, a period of crucial decision-making for the currency, including the selection of new members. **********He added: \"Once the euro has been launched, I think there will effectively be more advantages in than out. The euro zone will have a character of attraction, of encouragement, of development, and those outside will benefit less,\" although they too will reap the benefits of financial and economic stability in Europe. **********The euro \"will lead to greater integration,\" he said. \"It will give more growth and confidence to Europe, and it will give Europeans, once they have the same banknotes in their wallets, the sentiment that they have a common existence. The concept of Europe will therefore become more concrete. Europe will have a more coherent economic policy. It will not be a federation, since the member states will keep responsibility for economic policy, but their individual margin for action will be restricted considerably.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/04/business/equity-offerings-set-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-08-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 541, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Equity Offerings Set This Week", "print_headline": "Equity Offerings Set This Week", "body_text": " **********The following equity and convertible debt offerings are expected this week: **********A Consulting Team Inc., New York, an initial public offering of 1.8 million shares.

It was the chapter by which the United Nations authorized the use of force against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war. **********Several countries welcomed Mr. Rizali's plan as a good basis for negotiation, but said the proposal went too far and risked producing an unwieldy Council incapable of taking decisions. **********The alternative United States delegate, Karl F. Inderfurth, called it ''a major effort to move the difficult issue of Security Council reform forward.'' But, he said, ''an expansion to 20 to 21 members is the largest appropriate to preserve the Council's ability to respond effectively to what are often urgent demands.'' **********Britain's representative, Sir John Weston, took a similar line, saying that ''the size of the Council envisaged in the proposal is too large.'' **********Italy strongly opposes the plan because it does not want to see Germany become a permanent member unless it becomes one, too. The Italian representative, Francesco Paolo Fulci, said the proposal would create a train with 175 nations ''crowded into third class.'' **********Mr. Rizali is asking the General Assembly to approve the plan in principle by September and to choose the new permanent Council members by next March. **********Since enlarging the Security Council means amending the United Nations Charter, adoption of the plan requires the support of two-thirds of the General Assembly and ratification by the national legislatures of two-thirds of all members. **********The last Security Council expansion was in 1965, when the number of non-permanent members was raised from 6 to 10."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/27/business/taking-in-the-sites-environmental-issues-are-clarified.html": {"writer_name": "Sreenath Sreenivasan", "pub_date": "1997-10-27", "snippet": "Growing debate over global warming, as well as El Nino phenomenon and intense smog over Southeast Asia, pushes environmental issues to forefront of news and onto many World Wide Web sites (M)", "word_count": 754, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taking In the Sites; Environmental Issues Are Clarified", "print_headline": "Taking In the Sites; Environmental Issues Are Clarified", "body_text": " **********The growing debate over global warming, as well as the El Nino phenomenon and the intense smog over Southeast Asia, has pushed environmental issues to the forefront of the news. Beyond the immediate headlines, though, there is plenty of information available about the environment on the World Wide Web. **********''Environmental information is one the most exhaustive content areas on the Web,'' said Pranay Gupte, the editor of The Earth Times, which covers environmental issues. ''But much of it is confusing and not well organized, so it's easy to get overwhelmed by it all.'' **********He said much of the information on the Web was contradictory and ideologically driven. To try to clarify the situation, The Earth Times offers its own Web site, with articles from the paper as well as original pieces, focusing on issues like sustainable development on a global scale. **********The Envirolink site is one of the largest on-line resources. The site, which got its start in 1991 as an E-mail mailing list about the environment out of Carnegie Mellon University, features news sources, data bases, bulletin boards, chat rooms and links to other nonprofit organizations. A featured item this week: ''Your Clothing Is Killing You'' (a plea for organic clothing). **********The Environmental Protection Agency is another logical place to visit. The agency has a fairly sophisticated site that is constantly updated and aimed at a variety of audiences. **********For businesses, of course, making sense of complicated environmental laws is not easy. An attempt to make them easier to understand can be found at the site of the Environmental Compliance Assistance Center, a partnership of the E.P.A., industry and Front Range Community College in Colorado. **********The Pace University School of Law's Global Warming Central site focuses on the debate on global warming and provides useful data and links for understanding the controversial issues. **********The Environmental News Network, which bills itself as ''the environmental science supersite,'' provides news culled from various media outlets. The site also offers audio reports using Real Audio software, and users can sign up for a free E-mail newsletter. **********Two other comprehensive sources of environmental information are the sites of the World Wildlife Fund (which offers a free screen saver and a nature quiz) and the World Resources Institute, a research group in Washington. **********One place to find environmental sites is the search engine Yahoo, which has special sections dedicated to El Nino and smog. **********Given the nature of those involved in environmental issues, it is not surprising that advocacy plays an important role in many sites. Take the Environmental Defense Fund site, for example. It covers subjects like ''Reversing Decline of New England Fisheries,'' ''Something to Hide: The Sorry State of Plastics Recycling'' and ''Global Warming: Our Nation's Capital at Risk.'' A timely page even deals with tips for a ''green Halloween'' (among them: trick-or-treating with pillow cases and canvas bags instead of plastic bags and composting leftover jack-o'-lanterns). **********The Natural Resources Defense Council site allows visitors to send E-mail queries to its experts on environmental subjects and provides links to other organizations that are environmentally friendly. **********The site of the Sierra Club, the nation's largest grass-roots environmental group, also has information about protecting the Earth and details of the organization's Chico Mendes award, which is named after the late Brazilian environmentalist. **********The National Wildlife Federation's site offers a section for colleges and tips on how students can get involved in conservation and other ecological issues. **********Greenpeace, the environmental advocacy group, uses its site to promote its activities in a not-so-subtle way, outlining various campaigns against pollution, nuclear weapons and hazardous chemicals. **********While most advocacy groups campaign against problems that they attribute to businesses, there are companies that favor environmental restraint. The Greenmoney On-line Guide, which promotes ''responsibility from the supermarket to the stock market,'' has articles about, and links to, companies that are ''green friendly.'' **********Environmentally conscious tourism, or eco-tourism, is also represented on the Web. Try The Ecotourism Society's site and its guidelines for ''socially responsible travel.'' **********The death of the singer John Denver in a plane accident earlier this month has also drawn considerable attention to the environmental issues he championed. The Windstar Foundation, which Mr. Denver co-founded, has a site that explains those issues and the group's goals, as well as providing details about Mr. Denver's life as an environmentalist. **********Of course, there is another side to environmental advocacy. One of the sites with a conservative point of view is global warming.org, which is part of the National Consumer Coalition.

If you do, you'll get the best tax deal available this year. **********On the other hand, maybe you won't. Maybe the best deal will be available only if you sell later. **********And what will that deal be? Nobody is saying because nobody knows. **********The tax deal worked out between Congressional Republicans and President Clinton is unique in that it has an agreement on only one item: the cost to the Government. That is supposed to be $135 billion over five years. **********Unfortunately for taxpayers who are trying to make plans, the costs of the various proposals that Republicans and the President are pushing add up to a whole lot more than the budget limit. And that is creating a series of fights -- the kind you get when there is only so much to go around and everybody wants more. **********A likely result is that while capital gains taxes are likely to be reduced, the bill that passes will be much less generous to investors than the original proposals. **********For about 18 hours last week, it looked as though the effective date of a capital gains tax cut was set, even if nothing else was. After the market closed on Wednesday -- a day when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 139 points -- the chairmen of the two tax-writing committees, Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, and Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, announced that any capital gains tax cut would be effective for sales made that day, May 7, or later. **********But the next morning, Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota and the  minority leader, said that might not be true. It was not part of the original deal, he said, and was therefore subject to negotiation. **********So if you sell now, you may or may not get a lower tax rate. Robert Willens, a tax expert at Lehman Brothers, recommends that if investors want to take gains now, they should play it safe by using a technique called shorting against the box. In this method, an investor borrows the same number of shares in a company that he or she already owns and sells them, while holding onto the original shares. Such maneuvers will probably be outlawed under the bill, but they are still legal now. **********The following are the major areas expected to be in a tax bill, with some of the issues that could arise as lawmakers strive to keep down the total cost to the Government. **********CAPITAL GAINS The Republican proposal on capital gains has been for a long-term tax rate of half of any taxpayer's ordinary income tax rate. Currently, most investors pay 28 percent on long-term gains, although those whose ordinary rate is less than 28 percent pay that lower rate. The top marginal tax rate is 39.6 percent, so taxpayers in that group would pay a capital gains rate of 19.8 percent under the Republican proposal; for those in the 28 percent bracket, the rate would be 14 percent. **********Under these rate reductions, middle-class investors would get a better deal than those with the highest incomes. Their capital gains rate would be cut in half, while that of the big folks would fall by only 30 percent (from 28 percent to 19.6 percent). Of course, most of the capital gains go to those in the highest brackets. **********In the budget talks, games could be played to make that cut less generous. The Government could lengthen the long-term holding period, which is now one year. (Short-term capital gains are taxed at ordinary income tax rates.) Or it could put in a variety of holding periods, so that the longer the period, the lower the rate. Or the top rate could be cut only to 22 percent or 24 percent, instead of to 19.6 percent. **********Another method being bandied about would be to make the capital gains break subject to the alternative minimum tax, which allows fewer deductions and exemptions than the regular income tax. That would mean that some taxpayers would get little if any benefit from lower capital gains rates. **********The current law is that if you have net capital losses -- that is, more capital losses than capital gains -- you can take $3,000 of those losses as an offset against ordinary income. That could be abolished or, more likely, reduced by saying that you would need $6,000 of losses to offset $3,000 of income. **********It also appears likely that at least some of President Clinton's proposals to reduce what he views as evasion of capital gains will be included in the bill. These would include barring shorting against the box, and a possible attack on other Wall Street devices for accomplishing the same aim. **********The big revenue raiser in the package -- which would free up more money for other cuts -- could be to adopt his proposal for using average-cost accounting in computing gains. Now, for example, if you have 200 shares of Microsoft -- 100 bought for $50 in 1995 and 100 bought for $20 in 1993 -- and sell 100 shares for $120 each, you could say the ones you sold were the ones bought in 1995, and report a profit of $70 a share. But averaging would make you compute an average cost of $35, and give you a profit of $85 a share. **********If capital gains rates are cut, some individuals might want to reconsider holding stocks in tax-advantaged accounts like individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans. Those plans have no tax as profits are made, but they are taxed -- at ordinary rates -- when the money is paid out after retirement. For investors who own both bonds and stocks, it might make sense to have more bonds in tax-protected accounts, and more stocks in regular accounts. In those accounts, ordinary income taxes would be owed on dividends, but any capital gains would be taxed at the lower rate. **********Another provision that could survive would expand the maximum exclusion for profits from the sale of a home, from $125,000 for people aged 55 and over to $500,000 for a couple filing jointly regardless of age. **********I.R.A.'S Currently, many individuals cannot contribute pretax dollars to an I.R.A. Senator Roth, in particular, has pushed for an expanded I.R.A. open to all. That could be a huge revenue loser, and if it survives at all, it is likely to be scaled back, perhaps with a phase-in period. **********One way to provide a big break, without costing the Government much in the early years, would be through a back-end I.R.A. That would involve contributing post-tax dollars to the I.R.A., but then not paying tax on the money when it was withdrawn. In effect, such I.R.A.'s would be treated like investments in municipal bonds. The cost to the Government would be big, but only in later years when many people were retiring. **********ESTATE TAXES The Republicans have talked about doubling the estate tax exclusion from $600,000 to $1.2 million. That would mean that millions of estates would pay no estate tax. But it would also be costly. A way to ease its budget impact would be to phase it in over several years. **********KIDDIE CREDITS One of the Republicans' favorite proposals is to give parents a tax credit of $500 a child. Again, this package may be too costly to the Government without some modification. The current proposal removes such a credit for couples making more than $110,000 a year. That income figure could come down. And the credit could be phased in, to delay the cost. **********EDUCATION PROVISIONS President Clinton wants tax code provisions to make college more affordable. He says $35 billion of the $135 billion in tax cuts should be earmarked for such college programs. The Republicans say they never promised that amount, although they agreed to try. His proposals would provide a tax deduction of up to $10,000 for college tuition and a $1,500 tuition tax credit for some students for each of the first two years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/17/business/company-briefs-215554.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-01-17", "snippet": "Kollmorgen Corp to merge its Macbeth color instruments business with Gretag AG's color control systems unit in joint venture to be taken public on Swiss stock exchange; new company will be called Gretag Macbeth Holdings AG (S)", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********KOLLMORGEN CORP., Waltham, Mass., said it would merge its Macbeth color instruments business with Gretag A.G.'s color control systems unit in a joint venture to be taken public on the Swiss stock exchange later this year.

Mr. Kohl now trails the leading challenger from the opposition Social Democratic Party, Gerhard Schroeder, by a 2-to-1 margin, according a monthly survey by the Electoral Research Group.

But they won't achieve the diversification benefits promised by advisers if they buy shares in the typical foreign fund, warns Tricia O. Rothschild in a recent edition of Morningstar Mutual Funds. **********Here is why, according to Ms. Rothschild, the international editor of the newsletter: Asset-allocation formulas that show the advantages of diversification are usually based on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index (the proxy for United States stock markets) and the Morgan Stanley Europe, Australia and Far East index (the proxy for overseas markets). While the S.& P. is a good marker of large-cap American equity funds, the average foreign stock fund looks nothing like the Morgan Stanley EAFE. The primary reason, Ms. Rothschild explains, is that the Japanese market accounts for nearly one-third of the EAFE, but less than 20 percent of the average foreign fund. Japanese markets, quirky though they may be, tend not to move in close relationship to United States markets. **********So it's no wonder that foreign funds fail to deliver the promised diversification benefits. Over the last five years, the S.& P. index showed declines in 15 months, while the average foreign fund lost money in 80 percent of those months, too. And returns can be disappointing: the average foreign fund has not performed as well as the EAFE over the last 20 years. **********Ms. Rothschild says a small group of foreign funds holds out the possibility of better diversification: international small-capitalization funds, a relatively new group that focuses on smaller companies that aren't tied to multinational trends. Such funds are also more likely to hold stocks in emerging markets. And when the United States stock market has struggled, the foreign small caps have held up slightly better than their larger-cap cousins. **********None of this means that diversified international funds can't make great investments, she says. Funds like GAM International, EuroPacific Growth and Templeton Foreign are in the top 15 percent of all funds for the last decade. But for diversification, she says, investors should look closely at their international choices. **********Wage Pressure At the Top **********American workers may be gaining only slightly on the wage front, but the top officers of mutual fund companies are doing quite well. **********The median income for chief executives of mutual fund companies rose 18.4 percent in 1996, compared with 30 percent the previous year, according to Fund Action, an industry newsletter in New York. The findings are based on information from 15 publicly held fund companies that are required to disclose such data to the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********The median income, including base salary and short-term bonuses, was $1.45 million, up from $1.23 million in 1995 at the surveyed companies. **********Other executives are also faring well.

He was also among the experts at the United Nations and in Paris who set up the International Development Agency and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. **********He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Tatyana; two daughters, Gina Goldhammer and Sanya Popovic-Bogdanich, both of Manhattan, and a grandson."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/20/business/american-airlines-and-pilots-reach-tentative-accord.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1997-03-20", "snippet": "American Airlines and its pilots' union agree in principle on new contract, easing strike threat; accord must still be approved by Allied Pilots Association board and by union's members, who rejected previous accord in Jan; includes concession by ...", "word_count": 939, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN AIRLINES AND PILOTS REACH TENTATIVE ACCORD", "print_headline": "AMERICAN AIRLINES AND PILOTS REACH TENTATIVE ACCORD", "body_text": " **********American Airlines and negotiators from its pilots' union reached an agreement in principle yesterday on terms of a new contract, making another strike by the pilots somewhat less likely. **********But two significant hurdles remain to reaching a final agreement, and those uncertainties may give pause to travelers making plans to fly on American in late April, when a strike may still take place. **********The board of the Allied Pilots Association must vote on the deal, which it is scheduled to consider tomorrow or Saturday. If the board accepts the agreement, it must still be approved by a vote of the union's 9,000 members, who rejected a previous agreement in January. **********Although the latest agreement would provide higher compensation for the pilots than the rejected one, it also includes a concession by the union negotiators on which pilots will fly the small commuter jets that the airline wants to buy. This has been the central issue in the labor dispute. **********The agreement comes more than a month after a brief strike by the pilots was halted by President Clinton, who appointed a three-member board of mediators to work with the two sides to loosen them from their entrenched positions. The mediators submitted their report to President Clinton yesterday. **********Donald J. Carty, president of American Airlines, said: ''We are pleased to have a deal. While it does not give us all we had hoped for, we very much wanted to resolve this matter.'' **********People familiar with details of the negotiations said the two sides had reached an agreement in principle that was different, and somewhat better for the pilots, than what was recommended by the mediators. **********Although some details are still being refined, the agreement calls for the pilots to receive raises totaling 9 percent over the life of the contract, which would be in effect through 2001. In addition, the pilots would receive a large number of stock options. The company would also eliminate by the end of the contract a second-tier wage scale that dates back to early 1980's and has been criticized by American's pilots. **********In return for higher compensation, negotiators for the pilots' union have given up ground on the controversial issue of which pilots will fly the so-called regional jets that American wants to buy. These jets would replace turboprop planes on shorter, commuter routes between smaller and midsized cities. **********American has insisted that it will be at a competitive disadvantage if its higher-paid pilots at the main airline fly the smaller regional jets, because the commuter operations at other airlines like Delta are already flying these planes. Instead, it wants them to be flown by the lesser-paid pilots at the American Eagle subsidiary of the AMR Corporation, American's parent company. **********But the Allied Pilots Associaton has maintained that its members should fly the jets. The impasse over this issue led to the pilots' strike at American last month. **********The agreement in principle now calls for American Eagle pilots to fly the regional jets, but American executives have apparently tried to make this concession more palatable by, among other things, building restrictions on the kind of routes where American Eagle can fly these jets and guaranteeing greater job security for less senior members of the Allied Pilots Association. **********Still, even with better pay and other conditions, many pilots see it as an all-or-nothing issue, and say that it will set a dangerous precedent for the industry. One dissident group of pilots has rallied around the slogan ''Defending the Profession,'' and has lobbied other pilots to vote against any deal that surrenders jet flying to Eagle pilots, who are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association. **********''That is the most critical issue,'' said Glenn Schafer, coordinator for the group, which has received financial support from about 700 pilots. If the pilots are asked to vote on an agreement that concedes this point to the airline, ''then we wouldn't recommend the deal,'' he said. **********American's pilots have shown they are a demanding group. Their board tentatively agreed to a contract last November, but in January -- to the surprise of the company, investors and the union leaders who had blessed the deal -- the membership voted down the agreement, starting the timetable that led to the brief strike last month and the report from the mediators appointed by President Clinton. **********In a statement, the White House said yesterday that the mediators were recommending pay increases totaling 6.5 percent over the next four years. The board also recommended that pilots of American's commuter subsidiary, American Eagle, fly the so-called regional jets, with a number of restrictions to appease the Allied Pilots Association. **********The White House statement noted that the report was not legally binding on the parties, but that President Clinton expressed his hope that the board's recommendations would help the parties reach a settlement. **********''The best resolution is a negotiated settlement acceptable to both sides of this dispute,'' President Clinton said. **********If no settlement is reached by 12:01 A.M. on April 28, the pilots would be free to strike, but could be blocked by an act of Congress. **********The overall proposal that the pilots' negotiators have agreed to in principle is most likely better than what they rejected just before their strike. Although people familiar with details of those talks offered different versions of the proposal at the time, in broad terms it called for a raise of about 6 percent over a four-year contract and approximately five million stock options, each valued at $10 below market value. It also included the provision that Eagle pilots fly the regional jets. **********The agreement in principle was disclosed yesterday after the stock market closed. Earlier, shares of AMR ended trading down $1.625, at $84.625, on the New York Stock Exchange."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/29/your-money/IHT-cutting-the-smallcap-universe-down-to-size.html": {"writer_name": "Digby Larner", "pub_date": "1997-11-29", "snippet": "WHATEVER the advantages of investing in smaller companies, choosing the right stocks from the several thousand on offer worldwide can be a nightmare.

Worse still, thanks to the sector's volatility, making the wrong choice can be especially costly. **********For these reasons, more professional and private investors are using so-called quantitative systems to make the task easier. Instead of sifting through acres of data by hand, information on any number of stocks can be screened by computer and ranked according to various valuation and risk measures. **********Investors looking for value, for example, are frequently attracted to stocks with relatively low price/earnings ratios: The lower it is, the more potential the stock is thought to have. But those seeking growth stocks may prefer ranking data according to earnings-per-share figures. **********The efficiency of such programs has even led many hands-on investors to use them, at least to some degree. For those with a more arms-length attitude toward choosing stocks by the numbers, there are so-called quant funds. **********Guinness Flight Hambro Asset Management Ltd. in London will soon start an international smaller-companies fund that depends on a computer to sift through thousands of stocks. The data is supplied by HSBC James Capel, another British fund manager, and includes detailed information on 2,000 smaller-company stocks worldwide dating from 1989. **********\"It helps bring the universe of possible choices down to a level that enables managers here to cut out much of the laborious leg-work,\" said Camilla Reeves, a European fund manager with Guinness Flight Hambro. **********Apart from ranking stocks by P/E ratios, the Guinness Flight quant program can screen company debt ratios, earnings, book values and many others. The favored valuation type may change according to the sector or market \u2014 or just because of changing valuation fashions, Ms. Reeves said. **********One emerging valuation type is economic-value-added ratio, or EVA. It weighs the cost of the company's debts against the earnings drawn from its assets. By working through a series of equations, it is possible, in theory, to project the impact on the stock value. **********Another increasingly used valuation screen is the price-to-book-value ratio. This compares the company's stock price to the worth of its assets. When the total assets are more valuable than its shares, the stock may be worth buying. **********Mainstream software developers such as Microsoft do not offer stock selection programs as part of their money-based software for personal computers. Even if they did, investors would still have to find a source for stock data. The Internet is rapidly proving to be a rich and cheap source for quantitative stock selection. **********Alex Greyserman, a quantitative fund manager with Mint Investment Management Co. in New Jersey, said some Web sites offered the service free. **********The systems that Mint uses, he added, mostly just take the sweat out of a process that any investor could do. **********\"One of our funds is totally quant-selected,\" he said. \"Every three months, we choose from thousands of U.S. stocks to create a balanced, value-driven portfolio. It's not rocket science, it's just systematic. Really we could do the same thing by hand but it would take a long time.\" **********But Rick Lacaille, a fund manager with Gartmore Investment Asset Management Ltd. in London, said quant programs used by managers do not translate easily into the retail investment market. **********\"With our quant funds, we're looking for broad themes, such as value or growth,\" he said. \"We don't want to find specific undervalued stocks. That's what retail investors want to do.\" **********Instead, he recommended that investors screen stocks by computer to find a handful with growth potential before making a final selection manually. **********For private investors who do not have access to the Internet, several business-services companies provide screening programs. In some cases, however, the cost can be high. Bloomberg Business News offers a subscription on-line service that includes stock screening as part of its range. But $1,600 per month for the full system is not likely to appeal to investors interested only in stock-ranking. **********U.S. businesses such as Value Line and S&P PC Plus also provide both stock data and programs to screen it.Packages exist for mutual fund investors, too. In the United States, where the number of mutual funds has grown to about 10,000, picking the best fund has become almost as difficult as selecting individual stocks. **********The U.S. fund monitor Morningstar Inc. offers a quant-driven selection of funds on its database. So does LaPorte Asset Allocation System, which is part of Burlington Hall Asset Management in New Jersey. **********LaPorte's spokesman, Richard Oberuc Jr., said the program used more than 80 valuation types to rank U.S. mutual funds. Its main advantage is that users do not have to be computing or finance experts. **********\"It's helpful to have a statistical training, but where businesses use this software they tend to delegate the job of running it to someone with little or no experience,\" he said.

The increasing attention paid to advertising in the news media has inspired more consumers to believe that they, too, can come up with creative and lucrative campaigns. **********''I think people are more fascinated with advertising than ever,'' said Jerry Della Femina, chairman and creative director of Jerry & Ketchum in New York, a joint venture of Mr. Della Femina and Omnicom Group. ''Once people feel comfortable with something, they say, 'Let's try it.' '' **********But when consumers try it, they most likely will not like it, because the answer from agencies and advertisers is almost always ''no.'' Sometimes, the unsolicited idea is returned with an appreciative form letter. Sometimes it comes back marked ''return to sender.'' And sometimes it is ignored altogether. **********The main reason for that rejection is fear of legal action from consumers who contend that campaigns created by advertisers' agencies were inspired by or developed from their submissions. **********''It's a ripe area for lawsuits,'' said Jim Astrachan, a lawyer who is editor of the Legal Advice newsletter in Baltimore, which focuses on advertising-related legal issues. ''Claims being made today are much larger in magnitude, and the cost of a case is so far in excess of what it was five years ago.'' **********Mr. Astrachan said he advised his agency clients to establish internal procedures to handle unsolicited ideas so that they never reach executives who make creative decisions. The origin of an idea is thus never in question. **********Most do just that. Typically, ad ideas are fielded by a single office like the public relations or legal department. Sometimes, mail room employees are trained to identify and intercept idea submissions. **********''We try to teach our people how to spot an advertising idea letter when it comes in, and they send it directly to me,'' said Skip McGovern, a vice president and lawyer at BBDO New York, a unit of Omnicom Group. The agency's policy is to send back a letter explaining that the agency cannot accept unsolicited ideas. **********''We have thousands of ideas in the bank,'' Mr. McGovern said, ''and what we don't want to happen is if people submit an idea that we already have and we go ahead and produce the commercial, they think we stole their idea.'' **********He speaks from experience, recalling a legal battle over the popular Diet Pepsi campaign featuring Ray Charles singing, ''You got the right one baby, uh-huh!'' A consumer sued, contending that the campaign had been based on an idea that had been submitted. The agency won, Mr. McGovern said, but only after a long and expensive legal fight. **********Jerry & Ketchum will not acknowledge unsolicited ideas, Mr. Della Femina said, and avoids opening letters that are thought to contain them. **********''It's dangerous,'' he said. ''The next thing you know, you are involved in a lawsuit.'' **********Donny Deutsch, chief executive of Deutsch Inc. in New York, described most unsolicited ideas as motivated by self-interest. The policy at Deutsch is to reply to such inquiries ''with a nice letter,'' he said, explaining the legal qualms. **********Several other agencies expressed similar sentiments, as did many big advertisers. **********The Coca-Cola Company ''responds to everyone with a policy statement,'' said Bob Bertini, a spokesman, that ''we rely solely on company employees, our ad agencies or entities retained by the company'' for ad ideas. **********At Johnson & Johnson, letters are sent to avoid ''possible confusion and misunderstanding about the origin of ideas,'' said Jeffrey Leebaw, a spokesman in New Brunswick, N.J. **********By ignoring consumer creations, are agencies and marketers missing out? Most seem to think not. **********Mr. Astrachan of the legal newsletter asserted, ''99.9 percent of the unsolicited ideas have no value.'' **********Mr. Della Femina agreed, describing them as ''all sounding like 'Putney Swope' campaigns,'' referring to the comic 1969 film about advertising that featured wildly satirical commercials. **********Consumers ''don't know the clients' problems,'' he added, ''or the marketers' needs.'' **********Ellis Verdi, president of DeVito/ Verdi, a creatively focused New York agency, said: ''Advertising is a craft, and it has to be learned. It's not something that consumers can do successfully.'' **********Not everyone concurs. **********''Our belief is that great ideas come from all kinds of places,'' said Nick Cohen, chairman and executive creative director of Mad Dogs and Englishmen, a small creatively focused agency in New York. **********If someone submits an unsolicited idea that is good as well as ''relevant to the issues the client needs to address,'' he added, ''we might even pursue it and involve that person in some way.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/14/business/pigeon-forge-tenn-attracts-tourists-and-money-as-well-as-traffic-jams.html": {"writer_name": "Edwin McDowell", "pub_date": "1997-08-14", "snippet": "Many small towns across country, such as Pigeon Forge, Tenn, home of Dollywood, Dolly Parton's flower-laden theme park, have used local attractions to turn themselves into major tourist destinations; Pigeon Forge has developed tourism department t...", "word_count": 1585, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pigeon Forge, Tenn., Attracts Tourists And Money, as Well as Traffic Jams", "print_headline": "Pigeon Forge, Tenn., Attracts Tourists And Money, as Well as Traffic Jams", "body_text": " **********Not too many years ago, this town of fewer than 4,000 people in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains was a sleepy farming community with two stop lights. **********Now, Pigeon Forge and the equally tiny town of Gatlinburg, just five miles away, are each overrun by as many as 100,000 people on a summer's day -- a total of 10 million visitors each throughout the year. That makes them, other than the country music mecca of Nashville, the most heavily visited tourist destinations in the state, outpulling even the nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which attracts nine million tourists a year. **********What's drawing the crowds to this remote corner of eastern Tennessee, 35 miles from Knoxville? Dollywood, Dolly Parton's flower-laden theme park, for one, and more than 200 stores in six outlet malls here and about 400 specialty stores in Gatlinburg. Nature is just one allure of many -- and not always the most popular one. **********As with other small towns that have hit it big as tourist destinations -- from Ashland, Ore., on the West Coast to Myrtle Beach, S.C., on the East Coast -- Pigeon Forge can point to plenty of new jobs and a new identity. **********But as many other boom towns have also found, explosive growth has not been an unalloyed blessing here and in the surrounding Sevier County. **********Tree-lined country roads have given way to a seemingly endless array of souvenir shops, miniature golf courses, restaurants, bungee jumps and other amusements that stretch for miles along U.S. 441, the traffic-clogged corridor that runs through the heart of both Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg. **********Away from the main road, there is now a transient quality to life. Many of the thousands of new jobs in Pigeon Forge are low paying and hard to fill. Newcomers arrive sometimes with little more than the shirts on their backs, while others drift away disillusioned, uprooting their school-aged children with them. **********Town officials acknowledge the attendant social problems, and say they are working to improve them, but add that they have had no real choice about the basic direction Pigeon Forge has taken. **********''We don't have a single other industry but tourism,'' said Kay Powell, assistant director of the town's Department of Tourism. And at least the problems created by tourism, local officials say, are an improvement over what existed before. **********So Pigeon Forge -- like dozens of other similarly placed communities around the country -- continues to pursue tourists and their dollars with single-minded devotion. This despite the fact that growth has been blunted at many tourist towns, including Branson, Mo., the tiny but hugely successful entertainment center of the Ozarks where local officials are now struggling to overcome the disenchantment of some visitors turned off by the congestion and traffic jams that success has produced. **********Indeed, to keep things humming, Pigeon Forge has developed a tourism department that has contributed mightily to the town's success in taking in $545 million last year, its best year ever. (Gatlinburg, which has its own tourist bureau, pulled in nearly $307 million, also a record.) **********The largely home-grown tourism operation combines a small-town work ethic with big-city moxie, careful cultivation of the trade press, meticulous attention to detail and an $8.4 million operating budget that includes a robust $6.4 million for advertising. **********So meticulous is Pigeon Forge's attention to details, and so dogged its pursuit of dollars, that its 29-employee Convention and Visitors Bureau maintains 28 toll-free numbers, at a cost of $400,000 a year, in order to track the response to its ads in newspapers and on radio and television. Each month its staff examines the registration cards of hotels and campgrounds to compile ZIP codes, the average number in each party and the average length of stay. It also hires the Perdue Research Group in Nashville to ask recent visitors what they liked or disliked about Pigeon Forge. **********Whatever problems the town is having with traffic, it clearly is a big hit with many visitors. Consider the experience of the 41 members of the Germino family, who held their reunion here recently. They came from six states and as far away as Texas. **********''We chose it because it's not too expensive, it's centrally located and it has something for all our family's ages, from 10 months to about 70,'' said Debra Feinstein of Hicksville, N.Y., a granddaughter of the family patriarch who emigrated from Italy to New York in 1923. ''This whole area's great for a family vacation.'' **********At that moment Mrs. Feinstein, her husband, Andrew, and their two young daughters, Arianna and Sara, were strolling through Dollywood, which drew 2.1 million paying visitors last year. **********Because most visitors are drawn to both Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, officials tend to play down the rivalry between the two hamlets. Except on occasion. ''We were a tourist destination,'' said Tony Funderburg, a spokesman for the Gatlinburg Convention and Visitors Bureau, ''when Pigeon Forge was two lanes and a gas station.'' **********With shopping, attractions and 9 live music theaters, soon to be 10, many visitors here do not visit the national park at all, or zip in and out for what locals call ''a windshield experience.'' Dotty Germino of De Soto, Tex., who planned the Germino clan's recent reunion, did not make it to the park. ''There was so much for everyone to do,'' she said afterward, ''that I just ran out of time.'' **********Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg ''are quite commercialized,'' Mrs. Germino said. ''But I guess that's to be expected in tourist towns.'' **********Others, too, are drawn to the region less for the natural beauty than for the array of shopping, entertainment and other lures. ''We spent last night in a honeymoon suite in Gatlinburg, and tonight we're aiming to stay here,'' said Garland Morris of Fort Oglethorpe, Ga. He and his bride, Mary Ann, had just pulled into the Pigeon Forge welcome center in a car whose windows were soaped with messages proclaiming them to be newlyweds -- she for the second time, he for ''the fourth and last,'' he declared. **********To turn the area into a year-round attraction rather than simply a draw during summer vacation and the fall leaf-turning season, Pigeon Forge officials take special pride in having created Winterfest, which stretches from November to February. Performed against a background of several million twinkling lights and five miles of snowflake silhouettes strung along the road leading to the national park, Winterfest brought in $121.7 million last winter, more than double what the town took in during those same months in 1989, before the annual event was created. **********Dollywood has also extended its season from early April through December, and right now is going full blast. Reminders abound of Dolly Parton, the country music star, from Dollywood Boulevard to her radio station, WDLY, to an exact duplicate of the cabin in nearby Locust Ridge where she and her 11 brothers and sisters grew up. **********While it has the usual roller coaster, ferris wheel and other thrill rides, the park also reflects a broader Appalachian hillbilly theme. Such touches include the food (fried green tomatoes) and music (bluegrass and gospel), along with blacksmith demonstrations, soap making and a hand-built grist mill powered by a giant water wheel. **********Ms. Parton has a financial stake in the amusement park and she attends special events at least four times a year. She is a tireless promoter for the attraction and the region. Its principal owners, though, are Jack and Pete Herschend of Branson, Mo., who also own Silver Dollar City there, as well as water-sport parks in Branson and Atlanta. **********With about 2,000 employees during peak season, Dollywood is the largest private employer in the county, helping to turn the area from a place where jobs were once scarce to a place where employers now fight over practically every job seeker. **********''When I started with the State of Tennessee it was an employer's market,'' said Chuck Bradley, the manager of the Tennessee Department of Employment Security, and the former mayor of Gatlinburg. ''You had 25 applicants for every job. Now you have 100 jobs for each applicant.'' **********Tourist industry jobs, of course, are notoriously low paying, rarely offering more than $7 an hour here. They generally lack health insurance, pensions or other benefits. Pat Gregory, the area manager for the Tennessee Department of Human Services for Sevier County and nearby Cocke County, said worker turnover was also high because of a shortage of child care. **********Affordable accommodations are scarce in town. As a result, about half the workers in Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg live in Cocke County, about 35 miles away, while many businesses are permanently understaffed. **********Regardless, the impact of tourism has been overwhelmingly beneficial, Mr. Bradley said. He added, ''Forty years ago, there were no jobs at all.'' **********Extending the tourist season has helped mitigate the transient nature of the area. Jack A. Parton, superintendent of schools for Sevier County, said that 23 percent of the county's 11,000 students changed from year to year. ''But our dropout rate has fallen from 33 percent in 1988 to 8.5 percent this year,'' he said. ''I'm sure the extension of the tourist season has a lot to do with that.'' **********For all their commercial success, Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg are not for everyone. Take Ashwin Dave, a quality control manager for Coca- Cola in Baton Rouge, La. After driving some 700 miles with his wife,  Geeta, and their two children, he stopped in Gatlinburg to ask directions to the entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. **********''Our purpose isn't to see artificial things,'' Mr. Dave said softly. ''I can play miniature golf back home.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/16/business/swiss-bank-steps-up-to-buy-dillon-read-on-rebound.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Truell", "pub_date": "1997-05-16", "snippet": "Swiss Bank Corp will acquire Dillon, Read & Co, New York investment company, for about $600 million, one day after ING Groep of the Netherlands breaks off talks with Dillon (L)", "word_count": 775, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Swiss Bank Steps Up to Buy Dillon, Read on Rebound", "print_headline": "Swiss Bank Steps Up to Buy Dillon, Read on Rebound", "body_text": " **********The Swiss Bank Corporation said yesterday that it would acquire Dillon, Read & Company, the New York investment company, for about $600 million, one day after the ING Groep of the Netherlands said that its talks with Dillon had broken off. **********The transaction, which was negotiated in just the last few weeks, is further evidence of the determination of big European banks to build investment banking franchises in the United States. **********Swiss Bank paid handsomely for Dillon, Read, which has a storied history dating back to 1832 and now specializes in advising companies on mergers and acquisitions and in raising capital through equity and debt issues. The $600 million price is equal to three times Dillon's book value. That means that the firm's 50 partners, who own 75 percent of the company, and ING Barings, a subsidiary of ING Groep that owns the other 25 percent, will get big profits in the sale. ING's long-running negotiations with Dillon's partners to acquire the rest of the firm collapsed after executives could not agree on how to integrate the businesses. **********''Dillon, Read has very good management, and they have been very astute at selling themselves at a great price,'' said Perrin H. Long Jr., an independent analyst. **********Simon Canning, president and chief executive of SBC Warburg, Swiss Bank's investment banking and capital markets division, said, ''We want to be able to offer the widest possible range of investment banking services to our clients worldwide, and that requires a first-rate U.S. investment banking presence.'' **********Franklin W. Hobbs, Dillon, Read's president and chief executive, agreed, saying, ''This combination is an excellent fit for both firms, as it will enhance significantly the capabilities and resources we are able to offer our clients and the career opportunities available to our staff.'' **********Swiss Bank said it would incorporate Dillon, Read's business and more than 700 employees with those of SBC Warburg, with few layoffs. **********While the price that Swiss Bank is paying for Dillon may seem high,  established American investment banks are currently hot properties. Analysts generally expect that this acquisition, which follows the Bankers Trust Corporation's recent agreement to buy Alex. Brown & Sons, an investment bank, and Dean Witter, Discover & Company's pending merger with the Morgan Stanley Group, will be followed by other mergers and takeovers. **********There have been frequent reports recently of possible talks involving a number of banks and securities firms, including J. P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan, Nationsbank, the Bank of America, Lehman Brothers, Salomon Brothers, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette and Oppenheimer. In recent weeks, all these companies have declined to comment on speculation concerning their involvement in potential combinations. **********Against this background, said Sallie L. Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, the sale of a small-  to medium-sized brokerage company like Dillon, Read to a larger player with global aspirations, like Swiss Bank, ''is the type of deal one would expect to see.'' **********The acquisition, she said, should help Swiss Bank in the United States, because ''Dillon, Read has an extremely strong reputation.'' **********John Keefe, an independent bank analyst, said that Swiss Bank, while already holding a leading position in European investment banking markets, certainly ''needs as much mass as they can get here'' in the United States. **********The bank, which formed SBC Warburg when it acquired S. G. Warburg of London in 1995 for $1.4 billion, has expanded its American investment banking operations through a series of acquisitions. It acquired Brinson Partners, a Chicago asset management firm, in 1994, and a year earlier bought O'Connor Associates, a derivatives trading firm. **********Dillon, Read, which has not generally disclosed financial results because it is a private company, has certainly been profitable, according to its top officers.

General Motors is considering whether to follow Ford and Chrysler's example. **********Ford officials characterized their announcement as part of a corporate commitment to clean air. The No. 2 American auto maker said it hoped the sharp increase in the availability of ethanol-burning vehicles -- it made just 5,000 such vehicles last year -- would prompt more service stations to sell the fuel. Only 40 stations currently sell ethanol, which is grain-based alcohol mixed with a little gasoline. **********But as much as Ford and No. 3 Chrysler trumpet a commitment to the environment, they have an even bigger commitment to something they hold dear: profits. Under a loophole in Federal law, building the dual-fuel vehicles will help them sell more big-profit, big-engine, gasoline-guzzling trucks and sport utility vehicles at a time when strong sales of these vehicles is putting both companies at risk of violating Federal fuel-economy standards. **********Environmentalists were skeptical about the plan, contending that it violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the standards. **********Ford plans to make dual-fuel versions of the Taurus sedan, the Windstar mini-van and the Ranger pick-up truck. As far as buyers are concerned, the choice of fuels will make no difference, Ford said. **********Sticker prices will be identical. Ford will outfit the vehicles with stainless steel fuel systems that can run on either gasoline or ethanol, and they will have a small emblem on the sides of the car representing a green leaf sprouting from a roadway. Drivers will have the option of switching fuels every time they fill up. **********Michael T. McCabe, Ford's worldwide marketing manager for alternative fuel vehicles, acknowledged that many people might just put gasoline in the new vehicles. ''The customer is totally flexible,'' he said. **********That may be, but environmental groups scoffed at the idea of building such a huge number of vehicles, about 6 percent of Ford's total production last year, when there are currently only 40 stations that pump ethanol, all in the Midwest and Idaho. **********Daniel Becker, an energy expert at the Sierra Club, said Ford was inappropriately using a loophole in Federal fuel laws. ''Ford's announcement about making cars for which there is no fuel is a cynical ploy to avoid violating a law,'' he said. **********By law, the total of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mini-vans an auto maker sells in a year must have fuel efficiency that averages 20.7 miles a gallon. If Ford and Chrysler sell too many versions with high horsepower and low fuel efficiency their ''fleet averages'' sink, and they can incur costly penalties. Although auto makers have managed to manipulate production and sales to avoid such fines, they have resorted to a host of methods, including flooding the market with smaller, more full-efficient models, often carrying large rebates, to keep their averages within limits. **********Federal fuel-economy laws are administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department. The agency, which has a nonpartisan tradition, declined to comment on Ford's move. **********It is difficult to predict exactly how much Ford or Chrysler's overall fuel economy may be helped by selling dual-fuel vehicles. The formula that measures the fuel efficiency of these vehicles is quite complex. Mr. McCabe said, however, that for each such vehicle, Ford could effectively sell two more of its hot-selling, mammoth Expedition sport utility vehicles. But because the formula counts a dual-fuel vehicle as roughly equivalent to a gasoline-powered vehicle the gets 60 miles a gallon, the benefit could be even greater to the auto maker's fuel average. **********Auto makers earn this bonus regardless of whether the customer ever buys any ethanol. **********Not only is the fuel hard to come by, it is also more expensive to use. **********A gallon of ethanol fuel, actually 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, sells for about the same or slightly less than a gallon of midgrade gasoline. But because of differences in the energy in each fuel, a car gets fewer miles to the gallon on this blend, known as E85, so the cost per mile can actually be about 15 percent higher, Mr. McCabe said. **********Besides the stainless steel fuel system, Ford installs an electronic sensor that continuously measures the proportion of ethanol to gasoline entering the engine and adjusts the operation of several engine parts . **********The sensor and stainless steel fuel system currently cost Ford an extra $300 a vehicle, but that should drop with larger-scale production, Mr. McCabe said. Beginning a year from now, Ford plans to make 50,000 to 60,000 Ford Ranger compact pickup trucks a year with dual-fuel engines, he said. Within four years, the company plans to make 250,000 midsize Tauruses, Rangers and Windstar mini-vans annually with dual-fuel engines. All of the enthanol cars will be powered by Ford 3.0-liter V6 engines. **********With sales rising year after year for Chrysler's Jeeps and Ford's F-150 full-size pickup trucks, and strong sales in the first year of the Ford Expedition, both auto makers are in danger of violating Federal laws and paying penalties that would run into the tens of millions of dollars. **********G.M., the world's biggest car maker, also has some difficulties complying with the fuel-economy rules but is focusing its energy on the development of electric vehicles rather than ethanol-powered cars. Most foreign auto makers, particularly the Japanese, have relatively little difficulty meeting the United States standards because they mostly make smaller, lighter cars and engines that get more miles to the gallon of gasoline. **********The N.H.T.S.A. has the authority from Congress to raise Federal fuel-economy standards as technology improves. But the Republican Congress, at the request of auto makers, has blocked it from doing so for the last two years by attaching provisions to the Federal budget blocking any spending for this task and may do so again this year. **********Auto executives are convinced that the White House would like to skirt Congressional opposition, although the Administration has not yet introduced any formal initiative to do so. But by building a lot of dual-fuel vehicles, the auto makers could protect themselves from all but the most stringent changes in Federal standards. **********Ford's average fuel economy for mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks for the 1996 model year was just 20.6 miles a gallon, while Chrysler's was just 20.3. Ford did not face any penalties because the law allows an auto maker to average any year with the three years before it and the three years after it. But with sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles continuing to rise and overall fuel economy still falling, both auto makers are struggling even to meet the seven-year averages. **********Philip M. Novell, the general sales manager for Ford-brand cars and trucks, said in an interview that the company was determined to meet the law. Expanded production of the dual-fuel vehicles ''enhances our ability to comply with the law, and we will be in compliance,'' he said. **********In calculating the average fuel economy of an auto maker's vehicles, the Federal Government takes a weighted average based on each vehicle's efficiency in the city and on highways. By an odd coincidence, Brazil, the only large country that switched to mostly ethanol-powered cars after the oil crises of the 1970's, has been switching back to gasoline-powered cars as the Government reduces ethanol subsidies as supplies have proved irregular."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/19/world/with-pride-in-the-family-s-past-the-business-is-business-as-usual.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1997-06-19", "snippet": "Profile of wealthy Hong Kong industrialist Victor Fung; photo (M)", "word_count": 824, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "With Pride in the Family's Past, The Business Is Business as Usual", "print_headline": "With Pride in the Family's Past, The Business Is Business as Usual", "body_text": " **********Victor Fung, with cherubic cheeks and tending toward the chubby, hurtled along the marble floor of Hong Kong's still unopened Convention and Exhibition Center.

Even by Hong Kong standards, this is an extraordinarily fast-track project.'' **********Glorious in its prominence, the center was hurried to completion under Mr. Fung's firm hand in one of the three careers he juggles -- this one as the leader of Hong Kong's Trade Development Council. So efficient, or hard-driving, was Mr. Fung in getting his $623 million edifice completed, that both China and Britain chose it as the place where the Union Jack will be lowered for the last time and the Chinese flag hoisted to reassert Beijing's sovereignty over Hong Kong after 156 years. **********A measure of historical vindication lies in the choice of Mr. Fung's building, if only because his grandfather, Fung Pak-liu, and a colleague founded one of the first purely Chinese trading companies in Hong Kong, Li & Fung. It was to become one of the many large conglomerates run by Hong Kong Chinese families that would eventually displace Britain's great trading houses. **********''Our company has a pretty interesting history, and my life has been tied up in it,'' said Mr. Fung, who runs the family business with his brother William. ''In 1906 -- that was still the Qing dynasty -- we were the first to bypass the British hongs,'' or trading houses, ''and set up a real trading company in Hong Kong. **********''My grandfather knew English -- he had taught English at King's College -- and knowing English made the difference,'' Mr. Fung said. ''He was able to communicate with buyers and sellers overseas. Our company traded rattan, porcelain. Now we're a $2 billion trading house -- a lot of consumer products, garments, textiles, toys.'' **********A man both modern and traditional, Mr. Fung lives in a penthouse with a spectacular view of Hong Kong atop a 30-story building he owns that stands on the site of the first family home. His mother lives across the hall in the other penthouse. His brother lives downstairs. **********He did not intend it to be this way. After attending the colony's most prestigious boy's school, King George V, he went to M.I.T. in 1962 to study electrical engineering. **********''I didn't really like it,'' he said. ''It's too rules-bound. There's no way to create anything, like when you're expanding a business.'' So he switched to Harvard for a doctorate in applied mathematics, and then went to work at Citibank in New York. **********''It was a very dynamic place,'' he said. ''I was only 24, but my superiors were only 30 or so. Everyone was young and excited.'' **********Back then, he said, ''I didn't really miss Hong Kong. We were having so much fun. I liked living in the States.'' Indeed, his embrace of American life and business led to American citizenship. **********''I guess I always knew I would come back to Hong Kong at some point, but I had no idea when,'' he said. ''I was the eldest son, but at one point I thought I might not have to do it.'' But in 1976, Mr. Fung, his wife, Julia, and two children, Sabrina and Spencer, returned to Hong Kong. ''It was like I was never gone.'' **********Over the years, Mr. Fung and his brother took the family's sprawling web of disjointed enterprises and created a more focused company, selling off bits and pieces to buying out 35 family members, including their father. ''I had a hard time applying M.B.A.-type thinking to the company,'' he said. ''It was a different type of organization. It was more a family, patriarchal-type company.'' Even so, ''I would never say the old ways were wrong.'' **********Today, he oversees a company with 5,000 employees and offices in 20 countries and divides his time among the Trade Development Council, Li & Fung and Prudential Asia Investments, where he is chairman. This last is a branch of the Prudential Insurance Company of America. **********''It's not exactly 1/3, 1/3, 1/3,'' he laughed. ''It's more like 1/2, 1/2, 1/2.'' **********Despite his American passport, Mr. Fung said, he is unalterably wedded to Hong Kong, regardless of who is running it. ''I'm really a Hong Kong person through and through,'' he said. ''We are a totally bicultural family. I think this is the special characteristic of Hong Kong people. We can work and live in either culture.'' **********Yet, the transition to Chinese rule does stir something in him. **********''As an ethnic Chinese, that drives the emotion more than the passport you carry,'' he said. **********Four Destinies **********For Hong Kong's 6.3 million people, the transfer from British to Chinese rule is just one element in their lives.

For the first time, they are discovering that $999 can buy the latest technology -- or something close to it -- rather than a closed-out model the manufacturer had long ago replaced with something bigger, faster and better. **********As a result, sales of these low-priced workhorses have been skyrocketing lately. While surveys from two companies that track such sales showed slightly different results -- in part because they used different methodologies -- both indicated that new, low-priced machines were having a profound affect on the industry. **********One survey, from Computer Intelligence Corporation showed that personal computers costing less than $1,000 accounted for nearly 23 percent of all retail PC sales in July, up from only 7.2 percent in January. Figures from Dataquest Inc. were lower, showing that PC's priced below $1,000 accounted for 16 to 18 percent of consumer PC sales in the second quarter. In both cases, it is important to note that the under-$1,000 figure usually does not include a monitor, which typically adds a minimum of $200 to the price. **********The first under-$1,000 Pentium PC from a major manufacturer arrived in January, when Packard Bell NEC introduced its D141 model. Since then, the company, which is based in Sacramento, Calif., has rolled out two more lines, and leads the category with about 28 percent market share, followed closely by Compaq with roughly 25 percent of the market. And I.B.M., Acer America and AST have also brought out models priced below $1,000 since. **********But even before that, tiny start-up Monorail Inc. jump-started the low-end market last year with an odd-looking but functional system that includes a built-in notebook-style L.C.D. screen. **********Just who is buying these systems is still a matter of debate. Fred Kern, vice president of product marketing for Packard Bell NEC, said the company's research showed that 70 percent of those who purchased its under-$1,000 PC's were either first-time buyers or people who had owned a computer in the past but stopped using it once it had become outdated. That was compared with the 50 percent of all Packard Bell systems that are bought by first-time buyers. **********But the big question is whether the surge in sales of low-priced systems is leading to an overall expansion of the home PC market, whose reach into American households has inched up from 38 to 41 percent in the past year. At Packard Bell, the answer is a hesitant ''yes.'' **********''We think the market is expanding because of this phenomenon but we don't have any firm data yet,'' Mr. Kern said. But industry analysts, who generally concur that it is too early to tell, say a surprisingly high number of these systems are being bought as replacement systems by experienced PC users, and by small businesses and corporations looking to equip low-end users inexpensively. **********What market researchers have discovered about the fickle consumer market could be disturbing for the makers of these personal computers. **********Surveys of the more than 60 percent of homes that don't own a personal computer show that price is not what keeps many of these people out of the computer store. Rather, it is the perception that they have no use for a computer. **********''The majority of home users who don't have a PC don't think they need it,'' said James Staten, a PC analyst at Dataquest Inc., a market research firm in San Jose, Calif. **********But that, too, appears to be changing, driven to a large extent by the extensive hype about the Internet, Mr. Kern said. Add to that some major improvements that are expected shortly in graphics technology, along with the imminent arrival of D.V.D., a new video standard that delivers higher quality full-motion video than CD-ROM disks, and personal computer makers have reason to hope that the die-hards will come around soon. **********These new low-priced systems have a significant advantage over low-end PC's that went on the market before them. Their most noteworthy feature is that they are able to run the latest software programs. **********''The sub-$1,000 market used to be close-out computers, typically a few generations old,'' said Matt Sargent, an analyst at Computer Intelligence. ''Now we have Packard Bell, Compaq and others announcing systems that were actually new technology.'' **********But that's not to say the low-end  personal computer is for everyone. While sales of these PC's may be surging, the volume is still small in comparison with higher priced systems, and the $1,500 to $2,000 PC remains the best seller. According to Dataquest, more than a million PC's priced in that range were sold to homeowners during the second quarter, compared with roughly 200,000 PC's priced below $1,000. **********The reason? At the lower end, customers may be getting current technology, but they are most likely getting a bare-bones configuration. Most home PC's in that range, for example, typically have only 16 megabytes of memory, hardly enough to run more than one program at a time, a feature more experienced users would want. And such computers typically have the slowest of the current Pentium processors, easily fast enough for most users, but perceived as insufficient for heavy number crunching or for some demanding graphics applications. **********Likewise, a sub-$1,000 system isn't likely to have the fastest CD-ROM drive or the fastest modem, both features many customers would prefer to pay extra to have. **********But as analysts point out, home consumers typically do not need the fastest processor and largest drive, as long as they can do what they need to: write letters, track home finances and perhaps browse the World Wide Web. For those things, $1,000 could be money well spent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/16/business/informant-in-archer-daniels-price-fixing-case-is-indicted.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1997-01-16", "snippet": "Mark E Whitacre, former executive with Archer Daniels Midland Co who worked as Government informant in sweeping price-fixing investigation, is indicted on charges that he defrauded the company of more than $9 million; 45-count indictment charges t...", "word_count": 1230, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Informant in Archer Daniels Price-Fixing Case Is Indicted", "print_headline": "Informant in Archer Daniels Price-Fixing Case Is Indicted", "body_text": " **********Mark E. Whitacre, the former executive with the Archer Daniels Midland Company who worked as a Government informant in a sweeping price-fixing investigation, was indicted yesterday on charges that he defrauded the company of more than $9 million. **********The 45-count indictment, handed up by a Federal grand jury in Springfield, Ill., charges that Mr. Whitacre conspired with other executives to steal the money in a complex scheme involving fraudulent invoices, front companies, forged records and Swiss bank accounts. **********Archer Daniels accused Mr. Whitacre of stealing the money in 1995, and the executive has previously acknowledged obtaining it. But he has maintained for more than a year that he received it through an illegal, corporate-wide compensation system for its top executives. **********But, according to the indictment, the Government concluded not only that Mr. Whitacre's explanation was false, but that he had obstructed justice by trying to persuade a co-conspirator to back up his story. **********The indictment is something of a final unraveling of Mr. Whitacre, who was once considered a candidate for president at Archer Daniels, the grain giant. Only two years ago he was working side by side with law enforcement, secretly tape-recording his colleagues at Archer Daniels to prove a price-fixing conspiracy that he had exposed to the Government. **********And his cooperation proved fruitful: Archer Daniels, faced with Mr. Whitacre's tapes and competitors cooperating with the Government, pleaded guilty to price-fixing in October and agreed to pay a record $100 million fine. Several other Asian companies have also pleaded guilty to price-fixing and paid millions of dollars in fines. **********But by then, Mr. Whitacre's star had already dimmed as a result of the embezzlement allegations. He has spent much of the last year and a half publicly defending himself and attacking his accusers, from Archer Daniels to the Government. **********Mr. Whitacre was already charged last month with participating in the price-fixing conspiracy he exposed to the Government. Because he obtained the money illegally, Mr. Whitacre waived immunity under his cooperation agreement. **********Mr. Whitacre also conceded in an article in The New York Times yesterday that he had fabricated certain documents he provided to reporters to bolster his recent allegations of corruption in the price-fixing case by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Immediately after that admission, he agreed with a psychiatrist's recommendation and sought hospitalization for his poorly controlled manic depression. **********Mr. Whitacre's lawyer, Bill T. Walker, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. **********Justice Department officials declined to comment beyond what was contained in the 50-page indictment and an accompanying statement. **********In addition to the obstruction charge, the indictment charges Mr. Whitacre with wire fraud, filing false tax returns, money laundering, conspiracy and interstate transportation of stolen property. **********The indictment lays out a flurry of transactions, internal communications and discussions the Government says went into multiple transfers of cash to bank accounts controlled by Mr. Whitacre and certain of his colleagues, none of whom were identified by name. **********According to the indictment, the scheme began in the spring of 1991, and continued through about November 1995 -- some three months after Archer Daniels first disclosed the embezzlement allegations. **********The charges say that Mr. Whitacre, as the head of the Archer Daniels bioproducts division, created and submitted bogus invoices and other fictitious documents to the company to indicate that it owed money to various dummy companies actually owned and controlled by Mr. Whitacre and his associates. **********The bogus companies came with a range of names, including Aminac Mexico S.A. de C.V., Komven S.A. de C.V., Eurotechnologies, Covert & Associates, Far East Specialists, General Systems Inc. and four others. **********Apparently the first such payment was for $200,000, transferred to a company named JT Technologies. Later, another payment for $300,000 was made in the name of the same company. **********But, according to the indictment, JT Technologies performed no services for Archer Daniels. The indictment says that Mr. Whitacre conspired with another person for the JT Technologies transfer, but it does not identify that individual. **********However, other court and corporate filings show that the individual was Sidney D. Hulse, at one time an executive with Archer Daniels. But the records also show that at least one payment was made to JT Technologies prior to Mr. Hulse's ever working for Archer Daniels. **********Over time, the amount of money being transferred grew significantly. According to the indictment, in February 1992, Mr. Whitacre arranged for $695,400 to be wired from Archer Daniels purportedly for services performed by Eurotechnologies. **********While the indictment offers few details of that transaction, banking records show that the money went to account number 89-20107 at the Swiss Bank Corporation in Bern. That account was opened in the name of Eurotechnologies by Mr. Hulse, court documents show. In a lawsuit, Archer Daniels has contended that the money was subsequently wired to other accounts controlled by Mr. Whitacre, Mr. Hulse and a third Archer Daniels executive, Reinhard  Richter, former head of the Archer Daniels operations in Mexico. **********A telephone call to Mr. Hulse was not answered. Mr. Richter's lawyer did not return a message. **********After that, the transfers grew huge. According to the indictment, the following month Mr. Whitacre arranged for a wire to be sent from Archer Daniels to National City Bank in Minneapolis, instructing it to wire $1.5 million to Swiss Bank in Hong Kong. The money was purportedly payment for services provided by Far East Specialists, which is referred to in numerous documents as F.E.S. **********But, according to the indictment, F.E.S. was another front company, controlled by Mr. Whitacre and an associate. **********The most outsized transfer came in February, 1995, more than two years after Mr. Whitacre began secretly recording conversations at the highest reaches of Archer Daniels. In that instance, according to the indictment, more than $3.75 million was  wired from the Archer Daniels bank in Minneapolis to Chase Manhattan in New York. In turn, that money was transferred to the Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. **********The payment was made in the name of Applied Biotechnology Products Company, a concern purportedly doing business in Europe. But the Swiss bank account where the money ended up was owned and controlled by Mr. Whitacre. **********But perhaps the most damaging information in the indictment involves actions taken by Mr. Whitacre after he obtained the money. According to the charges, Mr. Whitacre used a Houston bank account controlled by a co-conspirator to deposit, withdraw and transfer his taxable income from the stolen money. That way, the indictment says, Mr. Whitacre avoided paying taxes. **********According to the indictment, in August 1995 -- the same month that Mr. Whitacre admitted to the Government that he had obtained the money -- he telephoned a co-conspirator  who was involved with the Far East Specialist transaction. **********In that call, the indictment says, Mr. Whitacre admitted that he had stolen more money from Archer Daniels than that known by the co-conspirator, who was not named. But he told the co-conspirator that he intended to represent the stolen money as part of an illegal corporate compensation scheme. **********In October 1995, that same co-conspirator was interviewed by the F.B.I., and he informed Mr. Whitacre about the meeting. Later, Mr. Whitacre telephoned the co-conspirator, the document says, but the executive would not take the call. **********According to the indictment, Mr. Whitacre appeared at the co-conspirator's home that same night and told him to describe the $1.5 million transferred to Far East Specialists as part of an off-the-books compensation scheme. **********Because of that attempt, Mr. Whitacre was charged with obstruction of justice for tampering with a witness."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/world/asia-nations-limp-into-fiscal-talks-as-turmoil-rages.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1997-11-23", "snippet": "Leaders of US, China, Japan and other nations of Pacific Rim, since first meeting as group in 1993, have swaggered into their annual gatherings almost arrogant in their confidence that region will be 21st century's economic engine and new locus of...", "word_count": 1311, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Asia Nations Limp Into Fiscal Talks As Turmoil Rages", "print_headline": "Asia Nations Limp Into Fiscal Talks As Turmoil Rages", "body_text": " **********Since first meeting as a group in 1993, the leaders of the United States, China, Japan and other nations of the Pacific Rim have swaggered into their annual gatherings, almost arrogant in their confidence that the region would be the 21st century's economic engine and the new locus of world power. **********But as they assemble here this weekend, President Clinton and his counterparts from 17 Asian and North and South American members will nearly all be limping, wounded by global economic forces beyond their control and, in Mr. Clinton's case, undercut by domestic political defeats. **********On Friday, the financial turmoil that has been coursing through Asia claimed its largest victim, South Korea, the nation with the world's 11th-biggest economy.

Consumed by their domestic economic problems, and by their associated political difficulties, few of the Asian leaders here will have much stomach for new market-opening initiatives that might bring objections at home. **********Moreover, having failed this month in his all-out effort to win new trade-negotiating authority from Congress, Mr. Clinton clearly has less standing to demand that other nations take politically painful steps to drop their tariffs and other trade barriers. **********And if Mr. Clinton cannot quickly convince liberal Democrats in Congress to change their position and grant him the negotiating power, his opportunity to pursue new trade deals in many product categories will be all but closed off, even if Asian trading partners are willing. **********Mr. Clinton is also still smarting from Congress's rejection last week of his request for $3.5 billion in additional financing for the International Monetary Fund, the vehicle through which the bailouts of South Korea and other nations are being coordinated. **********Mr. Clinton has been pressing for more I.M.F. financing all year to deal with exactly the kind of situation that has now erupted in Asia. Although Administration officials are confident that Congress will approve the financing next year, some foreign officials said the situation hurts the United States in its efforts to maintain its effective control over the terms of the international bailouts. **********The mix of difficulties make this year the first real test of the annual gathering, known as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or Apec. Founded in 1989 as a way for lower-level officials of Pacific Rim countries to discuss common interests, it was elevated to the status of a regional summit meeting by Mr. Clinton starting in 1993 as part of his effort to shift the nation's sights toward the economic opportunities and security challenges presented by a rapidly growing and modernizing Asia. **********The leaders ''face the most critical and difficult series of issues in the history of this young institution,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics. ''Their ability to respond effectively and decisively will go far toward determining whether Apec will become a central player in resolving regional and global crises.'' **********White House officials, while acknowledging the difficulties the Administration faces here, said the gathering would still be an effective stage on which to exert global economic leadership and, in particular, to highlight the benefits of trade and the need for Mr. Clinton to be granted so-called ''fast-track'' trade authority by Congress. With such authority, he can negotiate trade deals that Congress can approve or reject, but cannot amend. **********They said the meeting was expected to give formal approval to the policies at the heart of American strategy in the region: that nations  need to take responsibility for dealing with their financial problems by adopting more prudent economic policies, that the I.M.F. should take the lead when a bailout plan is necessary, and that countries should still work toward freer trade even while coping with economic difficulties. **********That policy was embodied in an agreement worked out by American and Asian officials in Manila this week. The agreement effectively scuttled an idea first floated by Japan, and strongly opposed by the United States, to create a bailout fund for Asian nations that would operate outside the I.M.F., which typically requires stringent austerity programs in return for its financial assistance. **********''In the past four years, obviously, with the enormous success of economies in Asia, there's been a good deal of emphasis upon what more can be done and how to take advantage of the rapidly growing economies,'' said Daniel Tarullo, Mr. Clinton's adviser on international economic affairs. **********''Obviously, this year, with the recent turmoil in a number of East Asian financial markets, there is a different tone and different atmosphere,'' Mr. Tarullo said. **********But he added the annual summit meeting would prove to be ''a good instrument in trying times as well as good times.'' **********American officials said that while they did not expect any big new trade deals, they were confident of winning agreement to drop trade barriers among the Pacific nations in one or two product categories ahead of the general deadline they have set of 2010 for the more developed nations. **********There is also likely to be some discussion with Asian countries of their willingness to agree to a proposed World Trade Organization plan to allow banks, investment firms and other financial services providers more freedom to do business in other countries. **********Mr. Clinton will also use the gathering to meet individually with leaders of several other countries, including Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan. Analysts and government officials are increasingly concerned that Japan's weak economy and the huge number of bad loans weighing down its banking system leave the country vulnerable to the spillover effects of the troubles in South Korea and Southeast Asia. **********Mr. Clinton may also meet with President Jiang Zemin of China. American officials said they would like to build on the Chinese leader's release last weekend of the prominent political dissident Wei Jingsheng and to discuss Mr. Clinton's planned visit to China next year. **********The leaders will also exchange ideas about how to deal with global warming in advance of an international meeting on the topic next month. And they are likely to consider inviting several new members into Apec, including Peru, Vietnam and Russia. **********The current members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.                     -------------------- **********Stocks Plummet in South Korea **********SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 22 (Reuters) -- Stocks plunged more than 4 percent here today in response to South Korea's decision to seek a loan from the I.M.F. **********''Investors turned skeptical as they realized the I.M.F. bailout package would not be like a free lunch,'' said Choo Hee Yup, a broker at Dongwon Securities.

His downfall was a result of the corruption brought about by the lack of regulation in the privatization of the Czech economy as it moved from Communism to capitalism and the corrupt campaign finance practices in his own party. **********The political crisis came after Mr. Klaus's colleagues in the Civic Democratic Party made damaging disclosures about a secret slush fund held by the party in a Swiss bank. **********The two junior coalition partners in the Klaus Government, the Christian Democrats and the Civic Democratic Alliance, withdrew their support, leaving the Cabinet with only half its members. **********Mr. Klaus, who rushed home on Saturday morning from a trip to Sarajevo, Bosnia, put up a last fight at an emergency meeting of his party's executive committee. **********But Mr. Havel, who does not have the constitutional power to dismiss a Government but has great moral authority in Czech politics, gave Mr. Klaus the final push in a televised speech Saturday afternoon. **********''The only fully sensible resolution would be for the Government as a whole, with its chairman in the lead, to hand in its resignation as soon as possible,'' Mr. Havel said. **********Mr. Havel tried to reassure the Czech people, who are only eight  years into democracy after more than 40 years of Communism, that the fall of a government was not the ''end of the world.'' **********The political upheaval has been brewing for months, largely because of corruption scandals in the stock market and the weak performance of the economy. **********But Mr. Klaus's undoing, came because of the financial scandal in his own party. Finance Minister Ivan Pilip, who also called for Mr. Klaus's resignation, acknowledged on Friday that the Civic Democratic Party held a Swiss bank account with $217,000 from private donors. **********Mr. Klaus has insisted that he did not know about the account, but members of his party assert that he was one of two party members who knew of it from its inception. **********Mr. Pilip was quoted in Czech newspapers on Saturday morning as saying that nearly all of the party's leaders were told of the account two months ago and that they decided that the money should be contributed to charity. **********Most serious from Mr. Klaus's point of view, according to Czech politicians, were accusations that the money was donated to the party in exchange for insider deals during the privatization process. **********The disclosures about the contributions were first made by the former Foreign Minister, Josef Zieleniec, who resigned last month, partly in disgust over what he called secrecy surrounding the party's finances. **********Two of the Civic Democratic Party's most senior members, Mr. Pilip and the former Interior Minister, Jan Ruml, who resigned this month, gave a harshly worded statement to Czech television on Friday saying that the continuation of Mr. Klaus in his leadership role was ''unbearable.'' **********Once the invincible politician of Central Europe, whose popularity was sometimes as high as that of Mr. Havel, Mr. Klaus has been losing popular support since before parliamentary elections last year. His party fared poorly in those elections, and he was forced to form a minority coalition Government. **********In the spring, a currency crisis forced the Government to devalue the crown, after Mr. Klaus had insisted that it would not be necessary. **********Mr. Klaus only grudgingly agreed in the last few months to plans for a securities exchange commission to regulate the scandal-ridden stock market. A number of small and medium-sized banks have collapsed this year, adding to the sense of unease in the economy. **********Most Czechs are not feeling richer, as Mr. Klaus promised five years ago, and many now know they may face unemployment as companies are forced to restructure."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/20/business/glamour-magazine-signs-up-diet-coke-nbc-and-target.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-06-20", "snippet": "Advertising column describes latest example of increasingly complex nature of promotional ploys that link marketers, retailers and media: an elaborate multimillion-dollar promotional marketing campaign centered on Women of the Year Awards bestowed...", "word_count": 880, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Glamour magazine signs up Diet Coke, NBC and Target.", "print_headline": "Glamour magazine signs up Diet Coke, NBC and Target.", "body_text": " **********IN a multifaceted promotional marketing campaign, a leading women's magazine is joining forces with a giant advertiser, a big retailer and the No. 1 television network. **********The elaborate multimillion-dollar campaign is centered on the Women of the Year Awards that are bestowed by Glamour, one of the Conde Nast magazines owned by Advance Publications. The partners recruited by Glamour for the foursome are: the Coca-Cola USA division of the Coca-Cola Company, which will be pitching its Diet Coke soft-drink brand; Target, the discount retail chain operated by the Dayton Hudson Corporation, which peddles Diet Coke and Glamour at its 751 stores, and NBC, part of the General Electric Company. **********Diet Coke will become the first sponsor of the Glamour honors for national achievement, which have been awarded since 1990, and create a parallel program, the Diet Coke Women at Their Best Awards, to fete women at the local level. The July, August and December issues of Glamour will carry advertising sections from Diet Coke tied to the promotion. **********Target shoppers, starting on June 29, will see in store aisles displays where they can enter names of women to compete for the local Diet Coke awards. Katie Couric, a Glamour honoree in 1992, will be the host of a special edition of the NBC News program ''Dateline NBC'' pegged to the 1997 Glamour awards -- and don't be surprised if a Diet Coke commercial or two turns up during that show, scheduled for Dec. 8. **********This ambitious cross-pollination is emblematic of the increasingly complex nature of promotional ploys that link marketers, retailers and the media. It seeks to build upon previous collaborative campaigns between Glamour and Target; Target and Diet Coke, and Diet Coke and NBC. The idea is for 1 times 4 to equal far more than 4 in terms of consumer interest and participation. **********''I hope everyone will get what they need out of this,'' said Mary Berner, publisher of Glamour in New York, ''emerging with something that helps all of our brands.'' **********She listed those goals: ''Glamour gets national television exposure. Diet Coke ties in with a franchise Coca-Cola thinks matches that brand and creates its own awards. Target gets store traffic. And NBC gets a terrific news program.'' **********Executives responsible for selling Diet Coke are enthusiastic about their role in what Lauren Bryant, assistant vice president for marketing operations at Coca-Cola USA in Atlanta, described as ''surrounding consumers'' with the promotion, particularly as the brand tries to refresh its appeal to the women who make up a large part of the Glamour readership, whose average age is 33. **********''This is so much in concert with our strategic positioning for Diet Coke as the brand for confident, fun, energetic women who want to look and feel their best,'' Ms. Bryant said. **********''The tonality and spirit of Glamour, the women they write about, are a great fit for us,'' she added. ''And the consumers walking into Target every day are looking for things like cosmetics, soft drinks and home furnishings to help them look and feel their best.'' **********Nancy Hendricks, Diet Coke brand manager at Coca-Cola USA, said that the ''aspirational aspect'' of the Glamour awards ''is very much in keeping with'' new Diet Coke advertising by Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which carries the assertive theme ''You are what you drink.'' **********Ms. Berner agreed. **********''If you look at our magazine, which Ruth Whitney has edited for 30 years, we don't tell you you need to lose those five pounds to have a life,'' she said. ''You don't walk away saying, 'I'm fat; I have no boyfriend;  my house is ugly.' We tell you you're pretty terrific. So we get a more confident reader.'' **********Diet Coke signed a one-year agreement with Glamour to sponsor the awards and has subsequent right of first refusal. Winners in past years include, in addition to Ms. Couric, Jane Alexander, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts; Sarah Brady, the gun-control lobbyist; Hillary Rodham Clinton; Joycelyn Elders, the former Surgeon General; Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court Justice; Elizabeth Glaser, the AIDS activist; Martina Nav ratilova, the tennis star, and Susan Sarandon, the actress. **********''The fact that the women are chosen by whether they have done something in a given year, and not just because they are celebrities, raises our comfort level,'' said David Corvo, vice president for NBC News in New York. ''We're confident that we and Glamour are on the same wavelength.'' **********''And though the show will have to appeal to a wide audience of men and women, as 'Dateline' always does,'' he added, ''an added attraction is that Glamour has an appeal to young women, which is a highly sought-after part of our audience.'' **********That is also a desirable demographic group for Target. **********''The Glamour reader fits our guest profile,'' said Lauri Matenaer, associate advertising manager at Target in Minneapolis, using that chain's term for customer, ''and Diet Coke is looking to beef up with our core guest.'' **********''We don't do a lot of different promotions,'' she added, ''but this was just so appealing.'' **********One danger with cross-promotions is that they become so intricate that consumers, cross-eyed, turn away. **********''Sometimes we complicate things in the spirit of making them bigger and better,'' Ms. Bryant of Coca-Cola USA said, ''but this is not some gee-whiz, over-the-top contraption.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/24/world/iraqi-exiles-say-hussein-s-son-may-be-paralyzed-by-shooting.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Jehl", "pub_date": "1997-01-24", "snippet": "More than month after Uday Hussein, eldest son of Iraqi Pres Saddam Hussein, was shot in attempted assassination in Baghdad, he still has not been pictured standing, and there are suggestions that he may have been wounded more seriously than first...", "word_count": 364, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraqi Exiles Say Hussein's Son May Be Paralyzed by Shooting", "print_headline": "Iraqi Exiles Say Hussein's Son May Be Paralyzed by Shooting", "body_text": " **********More than a month after he was shot in an attempted assassination in Baghdad, the eldest son of President Saddam Hussein still has not been pictured standing, and there are suggestions that he may have been wounded more seriously than first reported. **********At the same time, a leading Iraqi opposition figure said today in Syria that a subsequent roundup of suspects in Iraq has resulted in the arrests of some 600 people, including 20 high-ranking military officials. **********The opposition leader, Wafiq al-Samerai, a former Iraqi general and intelligence chief, said the blow to the opposition had been as serious as Iraq's penetration last June of a network reporting to another opposition group, the Iraqi National Accord. **********It was the third setback in eight months for opposition groups in Iraq.

By yesterday, that confidence had plunged, and stock markets fell sharply. The selloff in the United States, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 2.3 percent, was the mildest among major markets. It was a selloff that began in Hong Kong, where the stock market has fallen 23 percent this week. **********The effect of all the turmoil in Asia will almost certainly mean slower economic growth in that area and lower profits for some American and other multinational companies. And those Americans who invested in some mutual funds devoted to Asian markets have lost billions of dollars. **********But until this week, most economists had thought the impacts -- both economic and financial -- would be minor. The selloffs, however, have raised the specter of a worldwide loss of investor confidence. Were that to happen, the economic impact could be much greater. **********Most countries in Southeast Asia had chosen to tie their currencies to the dollar, with an exchange rate that is fixed or allowed to narrowly fluctuate. That had advantages for businesses, which could plan with some certainty, but it defied the fact that the economies were performing differently from the United States economy and each other. **********Over time, Thailand -- the first of the countries to suffer -- found itself with a currency that was overvalued. Imports were flooding in as Thais bought foreign luxury goods, and exports stagnated. Some international speculators began to bet the currency would be devalued. They did that by borrowing the currency -- called the baht -- and selling baht for dollars or other currencies. They would profit if they could later repurchase the baht for less. **********Thailand's responded with fury. It denounced speculators and took steps to punish them. It raised interest rates -- making it more expensive to borrow baht -- and prohibited some foreigners from possessing baht. That briefly strengthened the baht, and some speculators suffered substantial losses. **********But in the meantime, many Thais, particularly business people, became worried. They had borrowed dollars to finance their businesses, rather than borrowing baht, because interest rates in dollars were lower. If the baht were to fall, they would be in trouble, since the dollars needed to repay loans would cost a lot more baht. So many Thais bought dollars to protect themselves. And that buying, coupled with that of international speculators, overwhelmed the Thai Government's defenses. **********''When you have currencies under pressure, almost everyone becomes a speculator,'' Peter Allen, the head of emerging markets research at BankBoston, said yesterday. **********That process has been repeated in several Asian countries, among them Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Now it has spread to Hong Kong, a darling of international investors even after China retook control on July 1. The Hong Kong dollar has been fixed to the American dollar since 1984, under a system known as a currency board. Hong Kong currency is issued not by the Government, but by three banks. For every Hong Kong dollar they issue, they must deposit an equivalent number of American dollars. **********Hong Kong's interest rates have also been closer to American ones, and few people thought the currency was likely to succumb to pressure. But speculation it might nonetheless led to some of the same selling seen in other markets. **********To keep the currency stable, the annual interest rate on money borrowed for one night rose to as high as 300 percent. That makes it very expensive to speculate against the currency, and yesterday, even as Hong Kong stocks plunged, the Hong Kong dollar rose a bit -- evidently as currency speculators retreated. **********John Greenwood, the chief economist for GT Global, a mutual fund management company and a man named to the Order of the British Empire for his role in conceiving the Hong Kong currency system in 1984, said yesterday that he expected the Hong Kong currency to hold its value. But he noted that selling pressure had been greater than at any time since the Tiananmen Square killings in Beijing in 1989. **********He also said that were high rates to continue for months -- even at 30 percent or so -- it would depress the Hong Kong economy. **********It has taken months to persuade many investors that there was more to this crisis than currency values. When the baht cracked in July, Thai stocks rallied. (They have since fallen.) Numerous analysts opined that Thailand and other Asian countries  had buoyant economies that would perhaps grow even stronger since they were now blessed with cheaper currencies, making their exports more competitive. Some investors who withdrew money from Asia moved it to Latin America, confident that emerging markets were the place to be. **********But gradually, fear has set in that Asia, the strongest economic region in recent years, might be in trouble. That has set off alarms about growth elsewhere. **********Against the backdrop of record-high stock markets around much of the world, the worries led to waves of selling yesterday, first in Asia, then in Europe, then in the Americas. Latin America was especially hit, but the United States got off relatively lightly. In fact, after strong rallies earlier this week on strong profits from companies like I.B.M. and Microsoft, major American stock indexes remain higher for the week even after yesterday's selloff. **********For the American economy, the direct implications of the Asian turmoil are clearly negative, but have seemed likely to be mild. They will depress the profits of companies that sell things to the affected Asian countries. Relatively few Southeast Asian exports compete directly with American products, but those that do will likely be cheaper and thus do better. That could, of course, be good news for American consumers. **********The stock market selloffs yesterday smacked of panic, and panic usually abates within a few days. In fact, a security traded on the American Stock Exchange, equivalent to a basket of Hong Kong stocks, ended yesterday 3 percent higher than the Hong Kong market had been, indicating some traders expected Hong Kong to at least partly recover today. The longer-term question will be whether the Asian turmoil means world growth is likely to slow significantly. Were that the case, the high level of stock prices that has prevailed here and abroad could be in serious danger."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/20/business/antitrust-officials-argue-against-office-supply-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-05-20", "snippet": "Government antitrust officials say internal company document demonstrates that merger of office supply giants Staples Inc and Office Depot Inc would allow new company to raise prices with impunity in dozens of markets across the US; lawyers for Fe...", "word_count": 522, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Antitrust Officials Argue Against Office Supply Deal", "print_headline": "Antitrust Officials Argue Against Office Supply Deal", "body_text": " **********Government antitrust officials said today that internal company documents demonstrated that a merger of the office supply giants Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc. would allow the new company to raise prices with impunity in dozens of markets across the United States. **********Lawyers for the Federal Trade Commission opened their case against the merger before Judge Thomas F.

The settlement would require cigarette companies to pay $368.5 billion over the next 25 years to compensate states for the costs of treating smoking-related illness and to finance nationwide anti-smoking programs. **********Operating income at the company's Kraft Foods unit in North America grew 12.4 percent ''due to the consolidation of the food business, volume growth and some pricing,'' Mr. Feldman said. **********''The moves they've made over the last few years are paying off for Kraft,'' Mr. Goldman said, ''including the way in which they've taken traditional, ho-hum brands and made them exciting.'' **********But at the company's international food division, volume was down 1 percent, Mr. Feldman said, though operating profit margins improved to 10.9 percent in the second quarter from 10.3 percent a year earlier. **********At the company's Miller Beer unit, sales, in volume terms, were up 3.1 percent, to 12.4 million barrels, ''a very good performance,'' Mr. Feldman said. **********Among key brands, shipments of Miller Lite rose 3.6 percent in volume, and Miller High Life shipments were up 10 percent.

He was identified as Ahmed Mustafa, 23, an army driver from Adasiya, a village near the site of the attack, which occurred at about 11 A.M. According to some reports, other Jordanian soldiers described him as unstable, but Jordanian officials gave no immediate details from his interrogation. **********The sudden bolt of horror crashed in the middle of a raging political storm among the Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians, and there were immediate suggestions among some Israelis that the gunman had been inspired by a sharply critical letter that King Hussein of Jordan sent to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday. **********The King denied the possibility that the shooting was related to his letter and broke off a visit to Spain to return to Jordan and issue a strong statement of condolence and remorse. He said he felt ''a deep sense of shame and anger that this thing should have happened.'' **********Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who had begun the day with a blistering attack on Mr. Netanyahu in a speech in Bethlehem, later telephoned the Prime Minister to express his condolences and to propose a meeting. After rejecting an Israeli plan, offered last Friday, to withdraw from another 9.1 percent of the West Bank, Mr. Arafat had refused to take calls from Mr. Netanyahu. **********The 80 seventh- and eighth-graders from Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem, were on a field trip to the Jordan Valley and Golan Heights. Part of the outing was a visit to a tract of Israeli-farmed land between the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers. **********The territory, about 10 miles south of the Sea of Galilee, was formally returned to Jordan when it made peace with Israeli in 1994, but was then leased back to an Israeli kibbutz. Naharayim came to be known as the Island of Peace, and is a popular spot to visit in the scenic northern Jordan Valley. **********The girls who survived the attack had varied recollections of the details, but they agreed that the eighth-grade girls had left their bus and were being told about the island by a guide when a soldier charged at them from a hill, an M-16 automatic rifle blazing. **********''The bus driver yelled, 'Get down!' I saw my friend lying next to me, she had blood all over, it was all over my pants,'' recalled Oshrat Azulai, 13, surrounded by sobbing parents and friends after the surviving girls returned to Beit Shemesh. ''Others were lying around bleeding and not moving. Everyone was shouting and running. The teachers stood in front of us. Two Arabs grabbed him; he was very near us.'' **********After finishing one clip of ammunition, the gunman inserted another, but his rifle jammed, and Jordanian soldiers overpowered him, yelling ''Madman! ''Madman!'' The soldiers then stripped off their fatigue shirts and rushed to help the dying and wounded girls. **********Some of the teachers said the Jordanians refused to let the Israelis take the wounded girls to Israel, and pushed a teacher away by force. Seven girls were taken to a Jordanian hospital, where five were pronounced dead. Two others died on arrival at an Israeli hospital. **********Israel's Defense Minister, Yitzhak  Mordechai, went to the scene and was joined there by Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, King Hussein's brother. Mr. Mordechai said the soldier was a driver who had taken the weapon from another soldier. **********The description of the Jordanian soldier carried an eerie resemblance to that of the Israeli Army clerk who emptied a clip of bullets at Palestinians in the Hebron vegetable market  on Jan. 1, wounding five people. The Israeli, Noam Friedman, 22, has since been found mentally unsound by court-appointed psychiatrists. **********The shock of the killings spread instantly through the highly charged Middle East. Tensions between Palestinians and Israelis rose in recent days over the Israeli decisions first to build a new housing project for Jews in eastern Jerusalem, and then to withdraw from what the Palestinians charged was far too little of the West Bank. **********Mr. Arafat had refused to accept the ceded land and broke contacts with Israel and, defying Israeli protests, called an international meeting in Gaza for Saturday. **********On Sunday King Hussein sent a stinging personal letter to Mr. Netanyahu, charging that he was destroying the peace through his actions. **********At late-night funeral services today for four of the girls in Beit Shemesh, Mr. Netanyahu put a defiant edge on his eulogy. ''If anybody thinks that the murder of little girls will break this people, he doesn't know a thing about what this people is,'' he declared. ''If someone thinks he will break our spirit so that we give up our sacred homeland and our eternal capital, he doesn't know the great strength embodied in each and every person standing around me here today.'' **********Earlier in the day, Foreign Minister David Levy more overtly linked the shooting to the statements of Mr. Arafat and King Hussein. ''Who knows how many of these gun-toting lunatics are waiting for the green light in the form of a remark in which Israel is being described today,'' he angrily declared. **********Another Cabinet member, Education Minister Zevulun Hammer, was even more explicit. ''Perhaps the conclusion is that the King must hold his tongue so that a soldier doesn't take his words to mean more than he intended,'' he said on Army Radio. **********Some Palestinians said it was the Israelis who had set the tone for violence with their recent decisions. ''The situation which was created by the Israelis the last two or three weeks has created a lot of tension in the area,'' said Nabil Abu Rudeiheh, an adviser to Mr. Arafat. **********But both King Hussein and Prince Hassan denied a link between the King's letter and the crime, and both  took pains to underscore their commitment to peace with Israel. At the same time, Israeli news reports noted that on learning of the incident in Spain, King Hussein first telephoned President Ezer Weizman, then Defense Minister Mordechai, and only later Mr. Netanyahu. **********''Our soldiers are not politicized,'' Prince Hassan said while inspecting the site. ''If there has been a harsh exchange of words over other issues, let's try for once to keep our humanity apart from the political atmosphere. And if there has been a harsh exchange of words, I think it is probably intended to serve the interest of peace and to get back to working for peace instead of, God forbid, stimulating or inspiring such black acts of murder.'' **********In Spain, King Hussein said, ''When I warned a few days ago of the danger of the possibility of violence, I never thought it would lead to this.'' **********According to reports from Amman, the Jordanian capital, most Jordanians expressed dismay at the shooting. There were also reports that hundreds of soldiers lined up to give blood at the hospital where the girls were taken. **********''Now the Israelis are going to think that every Jordanian is like that stupid soldier and is going to attack every Israeli who comes to Jordan,'' said Maher Kadri, an Amman businessman. ''All we need is one drop of acid and an entire bucket of water turns bad.'' **********--------------------        Clinton Urges Restraint **********WASHINGTON, March 13 (By The New York Times) -- With the killing today of Israeli schoolchildren by a Jordanian soldier and ground-breaking expected early next week on a bitterly disputed Israeli settlement in East Jerusalem, President Clinton today implored regional leaders to exercise restraint. **********Mr. Clinton called the shootings a ''senseless denial of a future for these children.'' **********American officials said they would use the meeting of Palestinian and Arab leaders on Saturday in Gaza to press for calm. **********The meeting was called by Yasir Arafat, and Washington's agreement to send its Consul General in Jerusalem has been criticized by the Israeli Government and American Jewish organizations. But American officials say the meeting will be a discussion, not a negotiation, and that it will be a good occasion to try to encourage the Arab parties not to overreact to the groundbreaking at the East Jerusalem settlement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/14/business/worldbusiness/IHT-thinking-ahead-commentary-the-voices-of-global.html": {"writer_name": "Reginald Dale", "pub_date": "1997-01-14", "snippet": "Prophets of doom are beginning to be heard warning that economic globalization is propelling the world to some indescribable catastrophe.

The warnings are frequently couched in apocalyptic terms \u2014 and usually imply it is all America's fault. **********Typical of the genre is a new book by the American author William Greider, \"One World, Ready or Not: The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism,\" which is currently attracting attention in Washington. **********Mr. Greider expounds the familiar theme that multinational corporations are ruthlessly exploiting the workers of the world by switching production to wherever wages are lowest. Low-paid workers not only are stealing jobs from their brethren in richer countries, the theory goes, but will drag world wages down to their level. **********That much we have heard before, despite the fact that numerous serious economists have researched the proposition and found little evidence to support it \u2014 most foreign investment, for instance, leads to increased exports from home. **********But Mr. Greider and his fellow doomsayers undauntedly go much further. The mass victimization of workers, they say, will ultimately provoke a huge social upheaval. The world, Mr. Greider writes, is heading toward some kind of abyss \u2014 \"an economic or political cataclysm of unknowable dimensions.\" **********There is no doubt that globalization is already provoking a political backlash. It can be seen in labor protests on the streets of Europe and in the postures of politicians such as Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot in the United States. **********Those angry voices will grow louder when recession next bites. War and suffering have not come to an end, and neither have ideological conflicts. But the doomsayers' warnings are based on severely flawed premises \u2014 and they stem from moral rather than economic judgments. **********Perhaps that is not surprising. For those who don't like capitalism, globalization presents an awkward problem \u2014 by most standard measures, it has been far too successful. **********The breakdown of economic barriers and the spread of private investment around the world are finally bringing hope and prosperity to vast regions hitherto mired in poverty. Developing nations are scrambling to climb on the bandwagon. **********This is because, although globalization does reflect Anglo-Saxon free-market principles, it is not exactly being forced down the rest of the world's throat by the United States. As China alone should show, most of the world is turning to capitalism because it has seen that it works. **********Of course, anyone can travel to Indonesia, as Mr. Greider did, and find labor abuses. But the vast majority of investment by multinational corporations does not go to low-wage countries. It goes to developed regions such as Europe, Canada and the United States. **********When companies choose investment sites, the prime considerations are usually not low wages, which account for only a fraction of production costs, but other factors, such as proximity to markets, transport and communications. **********Nor do most multinational companies abandon their factories when wages rise to look for lower-cost production elsewhere, as is frequently alleged. As Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics in Washington points out, most multinationals are not in labor-intensive businesses. **********When such things do happen, it is normally only in the highly labor-dependent clothing sector, in which multinationals are predominantly Asian, and in footwear. Even in those industries, most multinationals pay high wages by local standards. **********Of course there is exploitation \u2014 but that hardly began with globalization. American fortunes were made from sweatshops in the late 19th century and from slave labor before that. **********It is also true that not everyone is yet benefiting from the global economy, particularly in the poorest countries. But so far, globalization has done far more good than harm \u2014 and most multinational corporations are actually better behaved than they used to be."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/05/world/rights-group-assails-us-on-land-mines-and-ties-with-china.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1997-12-05", "snippet": "Annual report by Human Rights Watch accuses Clinton Administration of arrogance and 'active obstruction' in its policies toward international human rights; criticizes US on issues ranging from global attempt to destroy land mines to interplay of e...", "word_count": 511, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rights Group Assails U.S. on Land Mines and Ties With China", "print_headline": "Rights Group Assails U.S. on Land Mines and Ties With China", "body_text": " **********The Clinton Administration was accused of arrogance and ''active obstruction'' today in its policies toward international human rights in the annual report of Human Rights Watch. **********In a survey of 65 nations, the United States Government received some particularly strong criticism from the private human rights group on issues ranging from the global attempt to destroy land mines to the interplay of economic and human rights values in relations with China. **********''Many Western countries seemed more concerned with striking business deals than protecting human rights,'' Kenneth Roth, executive director of the group, declared in making public the 465-page survey of government repression in the world. ''The fundamental principle that human rights apply to all nations without exception -- the universality of human rights -- came under sustained attack in 1997.'' **********He called for an end to ''hostage politique'' in China relations: ''bargaining for the release of single individuals without changing the underlying structure that allows the Chinese Government to detain thousands of others in jail and to make new arrests.'' **********Human Rights Watch said the year was also notable for the emergence of a fresh twist on repression in Central Africa with the slogan of ''African solutions to African problems'' used as a ''thin cover'' for abusing citizens. **********Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Congo (the former Zaire) were singled out, with European and North American governments accused of being eager to build ties with a new generation of African leaders who allegedly fail to rein in their security forces' resort to repression. **********In addition, the group described the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as ''increasingly crippled by its own indifference to the human rights record of its membership.'' This is a ''charade,'' Mr. Roth said, that has left the United Nations ''enfeebled'' in defending human rights as an issue that this year cost the lives of 15 rights monitors, all but one of them perishing in either Colombia or Rwanda. **********The criticism of the Clinton Administration was focused on its refusal to sign the treaty banning land mines and its reservations toward plans for an International Criminal Court and the proposed world ban on ''child soldiers'' below the age of 18. **********James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, described as ''obviously ridiculous'' the charge that the Government ''actively obstructed'' any move to strengthen the International Criminal Court in its proposed role of deterring despots.

Alongside the turgid current, the roofs of villages peak out in clusters above the gray waters. **********Hundreds of desperate people have camped along the thin remains of dikes, waving hopefully at passing airplanes that cannot land. Others have clustered on bridges and bits of high ground surrounded by water, erecting tents and lean-tos. Many villages have become islands, cut off by the floodwaters. At its widest points, the flood stretches for seven miles on either side of the river, running as far as the eye can see. **********For the last month, the worst floods since 1961 have ravaged the Juba River valley in Somalia, killing hundreds of people and destroying crops and food stores on thousands of acres of farmland. Roads, airstrips and bridges were underwater today for a 200-mile stretch of the river, from the towns of Bardera in the north to Jumaame in the south. **********''It's completely flooded,'' Patrick Berner, a worker for the International Committee for the Red Cross, said. ''People are trapped. Some are sitting on dikes waiting for help. They are just trying to survive. They don't have any more food.'' **********Unlike past floods, the floods this year are hitting a nation without a central Government or a national army, a fractured country whose infrastructure has been ruined by six years of clan warfare. A famine caused by the fighting killed about 300,000 people in 1992. **********''We have no government, and we have no ability to solve this problem, no finances, nothing,'' Hassan Mohammed Mohammed, the commissioner of Bardera District, said. ''We are trying to organize people and to say you must do something yourself.'' **********What is more, United Nations officials said, few nations are willing to help Somalia in the aftermath of the disastrous 1993 United States-led mission to help the famine victims. **********The relief efforts ended in a debacle, with 18 American soldiers dead because of fighting among faction leaders and with widespread looting siphoning off food and supplies intended for the hungry. **********''There are concerns about coming to Somalia,'' Catherine Bertini, the executive director of the World Food Program, said in an interview here. ''Nobody wants to have a repeat of what happened a few years ago.'' **********For two weeks, United Nations agencies and relief groups have been clamoring for donations from developed countries. So far, they have raised $5.4 million of the $9.6 million they say is needed. **********Yet the relief operation has barely gotten under way. No country has been willing to donate helicopters to reach the flood victims, and though three small boats have been flown in to begin distributing food and medicine to villages in the flood plain, they are too few to help the majority of those stranded. **********This week, the United Nations rented four helicopters from a South African company, but they are not expected to begin flying into Somalia until Saturday. At least six more are needed, officials said. Ten small boats donated by Norway are also to be shipped in later this week. **********Though the Juba River often floods in October and November, the rains this year came early and have been torrential and unrelenting. **********It has rained nearly every day in Somalia for the last six weeks. In the Juba River valley alone, most towns have received 10 times the normal rainfall over the last six weeks, according to satellite imagery. **********Heavy rains in the Ethiopian highlands have contributed to the flood crests surging south along the Juba and Shabelle river in Somalia. In Kenya, the Tana River has also broken its banks and the coastal region around Mombassa has been hit with flash floods. **********Along the Juba River, tens of thousands of farmers have seen their crops, food stores and homes destroyed. Local politicians and employees of relief groups have told United Nations officials that at least 1,265 people have drowned. United Nations officials estimate that 223,000 of the 800,000 people living in the fertile lands between the Shabelle and the Juba rivers have been displaced. **********In the village of Sarinley, about two miles north of Bardera, residents said the river spilled over its banks on Oct. 19. For several days, the village was a small island, with most of its 370 families crowded onto a hillock surrounded by water, until the last few days. **********''The people here have never heard or seen such flooding,'' the village chief, Bara Irad Ali, said. ''It has never happened in history.'' **********As the town received a small shipment of biscuits and maize flour from aid workers today, farmers told of having lost everything when the river rose. Underground stores of sorghum were ruined. The irrigated onion and tobacco fields along the water are washed away. The fruit trees in riverside groves are dying. **********People have been reduced to eating bitter greens and slaughtering their livestock, most of which is suffering from foot diseases. **********''Please help me,'' an 85-year-old woman who gave her name only as Norio pleaded with a visitor. ''My house was flooded and destroyed. I have nowhere to stay in the night.'' **********Ahmed Gure, a 40-year-old farmer with 15 children, is typical of the farmers in Sarinley. When the waters rose four weeks ago, he and his family had to flee to higher land. Now, the 74 acres he had planted with onions, corn and tobacco are inundated and all his reserves have been flooded. **********''All of them are gone,'' he said, pointing out to the expanse of fetid water where his farm was. ''I have no idea what to do. This is a disaster.'' **********The rising floodwaters have brought other kinds of death, village leaders said. Many people are coming down with malaria, respiratory infections, and dysentery. **********At the hospital in Bardera, the director, Dr. Kasim Aden Egal, said he feared the worst was yet to come. He said the hospital lacks medicine and supplies since Doctors Without Borders, a relief organization, pulled out of the area six months ago when one of its doctors was killed by militiamen in another town, Baidoa. **********''The water is highly contaminated,'' he said.

It will lead to thousands of South Korean laborers, presumably well salted with spies, working within North Korea and sending mail and equipment and messages between two nations that technically remain at war. **********North Korea is perhaps the most isolated nation in the world, as well as one of the most armed, and today's spectacle of South Korean and American officials helping to open a nuclear construction program there would have been almost inconceivable just a few years ago. Some experts still doubt that the program will ever be completed, but for many the surprise is that it has gotten as far as it has. **********The nuclear reactors are being built for North Korea in exchange for Pyongyang agreeing to give up older reactors that international experts believed were a front for making nuclear weapons. After a tense showdown three years ago that by some accounts came close to war, North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear program in exchange for getting shipments of oil and the construction of the two new light-water reactors, which are much more difficult to divert into the construction of nuclear weapons. **********''The work we celebrate today is on the cutting edge of future progress in the search for peace on this peninsula,'' Paul Cleveland, the American representative at the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, declared as leaden skies drizzled on the dignitaries. The organization is a government-backed international coalition overseeing the reactor program. **********But the main ground that was broken was diplomatic. The Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with only an armistice, and a final peace treaty, while under discussion, still seems some distance away. Thus the ceremony marked an unusual situation in which two archrivals agreed that one should build the other two nuclear reactors, before they even agreed to end their war. **********The situation was novel enough that 40 North Korean bureaucrats brought in for the ceremony seemed flummoxed about how they should react to South Koreans. According to a pool report by a small group of journalists whom North Korea allowed to attend the groundbreaking, some North Koreans applauded the chief South Korean delegate, while others looked around for guidance. **********The Korean Energy Development Organization has its headquarters in New York, but is charged with getting around minefields, literal and figurative, to set up reactors on the other side of the globe. Construction is expected to take up to a decade and cost $5 billion, most of which will come from South Korea and Japan. **********Despite its nominal focus, the organization is about developing far more than energy. It is a broad effort to entice North Korea into a dialogue and to take steps to build trust and eventually nurture a peace on the Korean Peninsula. **********''I think the presence of a South Korean work force in North Korea will help bring about changes and openness in North Korea,'' a senior South Korean official in Seoul said in a telephone interview. ''I understand 5,000 South Korean workers will go to North Korea to implement this, and I think that's an important first step in building inter-Korea exchanges.'' **********The North Korean customs officer who cleared diplomats and journalists coming from South Korea by ship to attend the ceremony also seemed to anticipate broader exchanges. According to the pool report, he joked, ''If it keeps on like this, there will be more every trip, and the whole of the South Korean population will soon be in the North.'' **********Still, the South Korean workers will be closely monitored and carefully segregated from North Korean society, barred from any contact with North Koreans except those chosen to work on the project. Even travel on North Korean roads does not offer a chance for contact with ordinary people. **********Many visitors have said North Korea is on the verge of a major famine, but the pool reporters said that in the area of the ceremony -- Kumho, on the east coast -- they saw no obvious sign of malnutrition and the fields seemed lush. Americans who have been based in Kumho to prepare for the reactor construction told reporters they also have not seen any signs of hunger, the pool dispatch said. **********Some critics have complained about the notion of the West helping  pay for nuclear reactors in North Korea.

Analysts said the robust report raised the specter of higher inflation and of a decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to counter it. **********Both fears combined to cause the bond and stock markets to plunge, although the stock market later recovered strongly. **********President Clinton dismissed any worries about inflation, pointing instead to the jobs created in his term. ''This is the first time in the history of our economy that over 11 million jobs have been created during one four-year Administration,'' he told reporters at the White House. **********The economy is ''on a roll,'' said Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, also playing down jitters about inflation. ''There's much to celebrate.'' **********While investors in the stock market ultimately agreed, traders in the bond market, which is sensitive to inflation, felt differently. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, an important benchmark for corporate and consumer interest rates, rose to 6.84 percent, as prices, which move in the opposite direction, fell. **********Interest rates are now nearly a half-point higher than in early December and a quarter-point higher than just before Christmas, when indications of economic resurgence first emerged. **********More economists joined the scramble today to raise estimates of economic growth in the final 1996 quarter, which already appeared to be higher than is consistent with steady inflation. They also raised their projections for the first half of this year. **********''You're starting off from a much higher platform,'' said William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, who now figures the economy grew at a 3.6 percent pace, rather than 3 percent, in the quarter that just ended. **********But while the chances increased that the Federal Reserve will decide to tighten monetary policy, most analysts also agreed that the central bank would probably not act before its March 25 policy meeting. **********At that point, they said, it would be better able to tell whether growth will ebb on its own, helped by higher interest rates generated by the market. **********Some analysts predicted just this. ''The current strength in the economy will be temporary,'' said Mickey D. Levy, an economist at Nationsbank in New York. ''In the spring we'll see signs that the current rate of growth won't be sustained.'' **********The jump in payrolls of 262,000 was the biggest gain since August and about 50 percent more than the consensus prediction. The Labor Department also raised its previous tally of total job growth for October and November by 46,000. **********For the full year, the number of Americans with jobs climbed 2.8 million, split almost evenly between men and women. The labor force grew by 2.6 million, with women accounting for three-fifths of the increase. This has caused the jobless rate for adult men, which a year ago was higher than that for adult women, to fall to 4.4 percent, a half-point lower than that of the women. The unemployment rate for teen-agers last month was 16.5 percent. **********A startling development, however, was the large increase in average hourly earnings. Most specialists had expected little change after a huge 9-cent November increase but pay rose instead by an additional 6 cents. **********This suggested a hefty rise in the quarterly Employment Cost Index, to be published Jan. 28, an indicator that gets close scrutiny at the Federal Reserve. **********For the full year, average hourly pay rose 44 cents, or 3.8 percent, compared with gains of 3.2 percent in 1995, 2.7 percent in 1994 and 2.4 percent in 1993. **********One factor in the recent acceleration is the increase of 50 cents an hour in the Federal minimum wage that took effect Oct. 1. **********But workers in retail trade, where there is a concentration of the lower-paid employees, had average increases of only 2 cents an hour in December and 4 cents in November after an 8-cent October increase.  Secretary Reich said the law had had ''possibly a small effect'' on wages in general. **********Other signs of strength included 18-minute extensions of the factory and private-sector workweeks and 12 minutes more of factory overtime. The measures of factory hours have now rebounded to near-record levels and suggest that employers may need to step up hiring. **********Nearly all sectors of the economy added sizable numbers of jobs last month, with business services contributing 45,000 jobs after a small decline in November and retail trade added 48,000 jobs, many of them in restaurants and bars. **********Construction employment, aided by milder-than-usual weather in most of the country, rose by 23,000 and manufacturing rose by 19,000 despite a continued decline at factories that make electronic equipment. **********Government showed 31,000 more jobs, but most of this reflected the fact that fewer election workers than usual were hired in November and thus there were fewer to be dismissed in December. **********The combination of more people at work and longer workweeks drove the index of aggregate weekly hours up nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 139.2, assuring a big increase when the Federal Reserve reports on industrial production for the month next Friday, the payroll data also showed. **********The Labor Department's survey of households registered 211,000 more people with jobs last month than in November, enough to keep up with a 191,000 rise in the labor force and thereby hold the unemployment rate at 5.3 percent. **********The November rate had initially been 5.4 percent but this was recalculated downward as part of the usual year-end revision that incorporates updated seasonal adjustment factors. The rates for January, March and May were also revised one-tenth of a point lower while August was raised one-tenth of a point, to 5.2 percent. **********Regionally, the December jobless rate edged up two-tenths of a point, to 6.5 percent in the West and one-tenth of a point, to 5.6 percent, in the Northeast. The rate eased two-tenths of a point, to 5.2 percent, in the South and one-tenth of a point, to 4.5 percent, in the Midwest."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/21/business/company-briefs-243884.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********MAIL BOXES ETC., San Diego, said its shareholders had approved its merger with U.S. Office Products.

As those who have been involuntarily parted from a job well know, the last goodbye is all the sweeter if the final word comes from the one who is leaving and carries a nice, sharp barb. **********Ed McManus of Marlborough, Mass., has unpleasant memories of a former employer. ''A dangerous boss he was,'' he writes. ''He was unsure of himself and tried to cover that with a meanness which touched everyone around him. It wasn't enough to win. The other person had to lose.'' **********One day, this boss gave a termination notice to a man Mr. McManus calls Harry. ''It was a performance issue,'' Mr. McManus writes. ''There were two sides to it, but Harry was out, and we all knew it.'' **********Harry immediately began a job search and quickly found a superb position for which he was not quite qualified. Disappointed, he mentioned it to one of the boss's key aides, who immediately applied for the position and was hired on the spot. In his exit interview, the aide told the boss that the lead had come from Harry. **********The boss was furious, Mr. McManus writes: ''He stormed into Harry's office and read him out in a voice loud enough to be heard by all. As usual, he ended the tirade with a threat: 'I intend to do something about this.' **********''Harry thought for a moment, then said: 'You've already fired me. Does this new action involve my family?' '' **********Meredith Lewin of Plainview, N.Y., once worked for a family-run business where the boss's son was employed as soon as he finished college. The young man reported to a friend of hers. ''The less said about working with a boss's son, the better,'' she writes. ''Suffice to say this was an insufferable situation.'' **********Ms. Lewin says that one day her friend, ''who had the patience of Job, reached the end of his rope, cued up Johnny Paycheck's 'Take This Job and Shove It,' set it to play over the office P.A. system and marched himself out the door.'' **********If you're going to quit, it's absolutely wonderful to quit a job you could do without in the first place. M. Ali Stephens of Boca Raton, Fla., will never forget overhearing this parting shot: ''Frankly, I don't even know why I took this job. I'm vice president of my own company. And you don't even pay mileage!'' **********If you're going to quit, it also helps to be financially secure. Don Hague of Silver Spring, Md., once worked in Alexandria, Va., at a new hotel where the director of housekeeping was short on experience but was dedicated and popular with the staff. She was an acquaintance of a part-owner who acted as the chief operating officer, and she was the daughter of a rather wealthy man who was willing to assist her financially. **********So the chief operating officer, taking advantage of the woman's lack of experience, their supposed friendship and her father's generosity, hired her at a salary well below the industry norm, Mr. Hague says. **********When the woman discovered how underpaid she was, she protested and demanded a raise several times. But nothing worked. So she quit, and her department fell apart. **********Now desperate, the part-owner called her and promised that she would receive more money. How much he didn't say, but he told her she would ''be happy'' with her next paycheck. The woman returned to work. **********Friday came, and the paychecks were distributed. The woman looked at hers and went directly to the part-owner's office. **********Standing in front of his desk, she ripped her paycheck into little pieces, declared, ''It's not enough; I quit!'' and walked out. **********Some shots are heard 'round the world. And some reverberate through the office. Virginia Miles of Englewood, N.J., a marketing consultant, recalls a situation when a female worker endured sexual harassment from her male boss for a long time. Ms. Miles writes that the woman asked him repeatedly to stop, but that he kept bothering her. **********''Finally, she went into his office, resigned and then gave him a resounding slap across the face,'' Ms. Miles says. ''It could be heard all over the floor, and everybody at their desks burst into applause.'' **********If you're really good at this parting-shot business, sometimes you don't have to part at all, at least not for a while. **********Consider Richard Carlton of White Plains, who once had a colleague known to be ripe for dismissal. Sure enough, one day the man was called into the boss's office. Minutes later he emerged cool and collected, a faint smile on his face. **********He was asked what had happened. **********''He told me that I was fired,'' the man said. ''and I told him he couldn't do that -- it was Fire Prevention Week.'' **********Mr. Carlton's colleague was let go the following week. **********Despite the soul-satisfying joy of a zinging, stinging farewell, it pays to remember that life plays its little tricks. Goodbye, forever, sometimes turns out to be nothing more than so long for a while. **********More than 20 years ago, when Joseph C. Kaplan, now of Teaneck, N.J., was a young associate at a now-defunct Manhattan law firm, one of his older colleagues decided to trade his long hours and daily pressures for what he believed was the more genteel atmosphere of academic life. **********In a speech at his farewell party before going off to teach in law school, he began by saying, ''I have mixed emotions tonight: joy and'' -- then came a long pause -- ''glee.'' **********About three years later, he realized that he was paying for his shorter hours and diminished pressures with a reduced salary that made it difficult to support his growing family. He asked his old law firm if he could come back. He was eventually rehired, but not before a partners' meeting that included an extensive  discussion of his farewell remarks, which they remembered only too well. **********Mr. Kaplan provides a moral: ''Flourishes and revenge might be a catharsis, but be very careful because, as the New York Lottery tells us, 'You never know.'

Since Jan. 21, the Dow has lost 223 points, or 3.2 percent. **********The downturn in stocks -- which stalled an impressive early January bull run -- has occurred as the yield of the 30-year Treasury bond has continued a monthlong rise. The yield rose six basis points yesterday, to 6.94 percent, a gain of 16 basis points since Jan. 21. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Raising rates could cause a further decline in the price of Treasury securites over the near-term and thereby lift yields even higher. That move could lure investors away from the stock market. **********Although the Dow has lost 223 points in the last four trading sessions, analysts said the recent losses are an example of how the market can suddenly change its focus from one set of factors to another: from excitement over strong earnings reports to concerns about higher interest rates. **********''There's this constant scrimmage going on between the good news and the bad,'' said Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at CS First Boston. ''The recent scrimmages have been won by the bond market, which has been slipping. With equity valuations now in the high range, investors are much more sensitive to disappointing news.'' **********Among the hardest-hit stocks in the last four sessions, has been I.B.M., whose shares have lost 13.3 percent since last Tuesday, following an earnings report that failed to live up to analysts' expectations. Yesterday, shares of I.B.M. lost 4 3/4, to 145 3/4, accounting for nearly half of the Dow's decline. **********General Motors also lost ground, falling  5/8 points, to 61 7/8, after the auto maker announced that it would buy back $2.5 billion in stock and increase its quarterly dividend 25 percent. Investors, who were expecting a larger buyback announcement, were disappointed. **********American Express also lost ground despite a strong earnings report. Shares fell 1 5/8, to 59 1/2. And shares of General Electric fell 1 1/2, to 100 3/8. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 445.8 million shares, much lighter than this year's average and far below last week's record-breaking performance. **********While the Dow has now retreated to 6,660 -- cutting its early January gains in half -- broader market indexes have also lost ground. The Standard & Poors index of 500 stocks lost 5.50 points to close at 765.02, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 11.02 points to close at 1,352.81. **********Still, most analysts said the downturn in the stock market had been a healthy development, one that has scared away some speculators and caused other investors to rethink some of their holdings. **********Analysts also said that investors were beginning to realize that some larger-capitalization stocks have in recent months become overvalued, and that was causing many investors to snap up small-cap stocks, which have failed to keep pace recently with the large-cap companies. **********''Maybe what we're seeing is some correction in the larger cap indices, while underneath that the average small-cap stocks have been doing better,'' said William L. Paternotte a research analyst at Alex Brown & Sons. ''Some believe corporate profits will be lackluster in '97.

While it singles out no one, the report sharply criticizes federal health officials for delays in using methods to screen donated blood sooner. **********More than 1,000 people in Canada were infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through the blood supply and unknowingly infected others. By the early 1990's, several hundred of the people who developed AIDS had died. Tens of thousands were infected with Hepatitis C, which can develop into a form that sometimes proves fatal. Ultimately, more than 3,000 Canadians are expected to die as a result of the tainted blood. **********The Canadian Red Cross Society, which played a central role in the nation's blood supply for half a century, was also criticized. The Red Cross has been forced out of the field as a result of the tainted blood scandal. Responsibility has now shifted to the provinces. **********Mr. Krever, an Ontario Court of Appeals judge, made 50 recommendations to overhaul Canada's blood system, including establishing independent auditors and paying compensation. Any action, however, would require government approval. **********Under an arrangement reached in  1993, some hemophiliacs who contracted AIDS during this period have already been awarded compensation of $23,000 a year, on the condition they waived their right to sue all agencies and corporations involved. Victims who developed Hepatitis C  were not compensated at that time. **********In the report, Mr. Krever recommends that people who find out they were infected before the blood supply was properly regulated should also receive compensation without having to prove fault. He does not exclude people with Hepatitis C. **********Durhane Wong-Rieger, who is with the Canadian Hemophilia Society, said the call for compensation is ''long overdue.'' **********''What the report shows is that many of the people who died, didn't need to die,'' she said. **********In his report, Mr. Krever says that  many of the ''problems stemmed from the way public health authorities dragged their feet in implementing new safeguards. For example, a safer blood concentrate used by hemophiliacs to control bleeding was not made available in Canada until 1985, a year after it had been developed. There were delays in screening blood donors and in setting up procedures for notifying blood recipients,'' he wrote. **********''The Red Cross should not have required conclusive evidence before taking strong action to reduce the risk of AIDS,'' Mr. Krever wrote. **********Canada's Minister of Health, Allan Rock, said today that the federal Government accepts its share of responsibility for the faults in the blood system. He said he would have to meet with provincial leaders before acting on recommendations in the report, and he issued an apology. **********''We can't undo the damage,'' he said.

The shells fell harmlessly in the rose garden. **********Standing with his aides outside the same residence today, Mr. Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., said that the visit, while obviously highly symbolic, had afforded the two sides a discussion in which they really ''engaged.'' **********''We certainly had the opportunity to put forward our view that all the hurt and grief and pain and division that has come from British involvement in Irish affairs has to end,'' he said. The meeting was not, he said, ''one where we put up our stock positions and Mr. Blair puts up his stock positions.'' **********A spokesman for Mr. Blair later agreed, saying that the session, which he called ''constructive and positive,'' had gone beyond ''people chanting mantras and slogans.'' He said the Prime Minister had sought and received from Mr. Adams a statement of his commitment to non-violence. ''It is important that I can look you in the eye and hear you say that you remain committed to peaceful means,'' the spokesman quoted Mr. Blair as saying. **********The Prime Minister told his visitors that if there was a return to violence, ''we waste the best possibility for peace that we have had for a generation.'' The I.R.A. renewed a lapsed cease-fire on July 20 and in September gained entry to the all-party peace talks now under way in Belfast. **********The party has obtained increasing recognition from Britain, a country that once so reviled Mr. Adams that his voice was not allowed to be broadcast here. In a step leading to today's meeting, Mr. Blair visited Belfast in October and greeted Mr. Adams for the first time. **********Besides the echo of history, there were also personal reminders to Mr. Adams today of the emotional freight attached to a meeting between a British Prime Minister and the leaders of a party that has until recently backed a violent struggle to oust the British from Northern Ireland. **********The father of a 12-year-old boy who died in an I.R.A. bombing of a busy shopping street in Warrington, Cheshire, in March 1993 called into a radio talk show to speak to Mr. Adams, and the mother of the last British soldier killed in Northern Ireland spoke to him from the curb of Downing Street before he went inside. **********Mr. Adams told the caller, Colin Parry, ''I know that you yourself and your family have suffered very much from conflict in my country.'' **********Rita Restorick, whose son Stephen was shot by an I.R.A. sniper on Feb. 12, said she told Mr. Adams that she hoped he would ''put an end to these horrible killings because I want no other mother to go through the pain I suffered.'' **********Mr. Adams said he had ''praised her for her courage'' and had told her that he knew ''many, many, many Mrs. Restoricks from our community, and nobody has a monopoly on grief or on suffering.'' **********Among the subjects that came up in the talks, Mr. Adams said, were transfers of Irish prisoners from British to Irish jails, demilitarization of the conflict and demands for a reopening of a widely questioned British inquiry into the killings of 14 civil rights marchers by British paratroopers in Londonderry in 1972. **********Mr. Adams caused a furor today by wishing ''good luck'' to a convicted I.R.A. killer, Liam Avarill, 32, who escaped from the Maze prison outside Belfast on Wednesday night by disguising himself as a woman at the end of a Christmas party for the children of jailed republicans. At this afternoon's meeting, Mo Mowlam, the British Secretary for Northern Ireland, pointedly told Mr. Adams his words ''had not been helpful.'' **********Among those expressing anger over the encounter today was Andrew Hunter, a Conservative member of a parliamentary committee on Northern Ireland. He said the invitation had been ''premature'' and that the I.R.A. cease-fire was not to be trusted because, he said, the organization was still recruiting, training and conducting private punishments. **********Ulster Protestants have condemned the meeting since it was first announced last month. Today Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said: ''The whole thing was an exercise of outrageous hypocrisy and deliberate lying. Here we saw the Godfathers of those who planned the bombing of Downing Street, standing outside there and piously pretending they were engaged in a search for peace.'' **********In an interview with BBC Northern Ireland tonight, Mr. Blair defended his decision, saying that seeking to end the struggle that has cost more than 3,200 lives since 1969 was worth the Government ''taking every risk it can.'' **********There are splits in the ranks on both sides of the conflict. Two Protestant parties show no disposition to enter the peace talks, and dissidents and defectors from the I.R.A. have expressed impatience with the pace of the negotiations and Mr. Adams's decision to agree to principles of democracy and non-violence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/12/business/clamorously-pacifica-radio-dances-toward-mainstream.html": {"writer_name": "Iver Peterson", "pub_date": "1997-05-12", "snippet": "Pacifica Radio, left-oriented network based in Berkeley, Calif, is in midst of rancorous argument over what goes on air and who should decide; argument about programming and control is part of wider debate about purity or popularity of public broa...", "word_count": 586, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clamorously, Pacifica Radio Dances Toward Mainstream", "print_headline": "Clamorously, Pacifica Radio Dances Toward Mainstream", "body_text": " **********Its name means ''peaceful'' in Spanish and its stated mission is to promote understanding among different groups of people. But financial pressure to reach a wider audience has supporters of Pacifica Radio, the left-oriented network based in Berkeley, Calif., in a rancorous argument over what goes on the air and who should decide. **********In a way, the argument about programming and control -- at the network's founding station, KPFA in Berkeley, and others -- is part of the wider debate about the purity or popularity of public broadcasting. But Pacifica's long tradition of advocacy and of anything-goes programming has made the adjustment all the harder to make. **********As Federal funds have stagnated and much of Pacifica's old radical audience has moved to mainstream fare, friction between professional managers and staff volunteers has grown. The network has moved to take power away from local advisory boards and give it to station managers, and to redraw program schedules to discard some of the more arcane, narrowly focused material. **********''People were not listening,'' said Pat Scott, executive director of the Pacifica Foundation, which governs the network, with its five affiliated stations. In addition to KPFA, they are WBAI in New York, KPFK in Los Angeles, KPFT in Houston and WPFW in Washington. Some Pacifica programming can also be heard on other stations. **********''The mission and vision of Pacifica is to promote peace and understanding,'' Ms. Scott said, ''and my position as executive director, and the position of the board of directors, is that we cannot fulfill our mission if people are not listening.'' **********Last month, however, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which gives Pacifica about $1 million a year, issued the results of an audit sought by opponents of the changes. The report accuses the Pacifica Foundation of, among other things, failing to comply with Federal open meeting laws and of undermining the autonomy of each station's local advisory boards. The audit was requested by a group called Take Back KPFA, which opposes the programming and management changes at the Berkeley station, a place where studio clocks were once banned as a way of freeing radio from time itself. **********Inspector General Armando J. Arvizu recommended on April 9 that Pacifica be given six months to comply with the audit's findings for open meetings and public notification or risk losing its funds. **********Ms. Scott called the audit ''completely false.'' She and Take Back KPFT will appear before the corporation in Washington next Monday. **********Ms. Scott said that local Pacifica stations had wide production freedom, and that the only network program they were required to broadcast was a daily newscast from Washington. At the same time, she insisted that KPFA's small audience made a more regular program schedule a necessity. ''We had a lot of balkanizing in our programming,'' Ms. Scott said. ''We had one program on Palestinians and one on Israelis and one on black Americans and so on, and we are moving away from that, and because this had been the tenor of the station for a long time, people are upset about it.'' **********Jeffrey Blankfort, a leader in Take Back KPFA, argued that some program changes might have been necessary, but that the Pacifica Foundation had been high-handed in cutting the authority of local advisers, volunteer programmers and technicians. **********''The positive thing about Pacifica Radio has always been that it was community-based and community-oriented and basically staffed by volunteers,'' Mr. Blankfort, a teacher, said. ''Pat Scott has tried to eliminate volunteers and to impose mainstream block programming, and this stands in contradiction to the long history of Pacifica.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/14/business/us-and-europe-in-pact-on-product-safety.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. and Europe in Pact on Product Safety", "print_headline": "U.S. and Europe in Pact on Product Safety", "body_text": " **********The European Union said today that it had concluded an accord with the United States to accept product safety tests performed on either side of the Atlantic, removing impediments to more than $40 billion of trade. **********The ''mutual recognition agreements'' involve products ranging from electrical appliances to medical equipment that account for $40 billion to $50 billion worth of European-United States trade annually. **********The European Union Trade Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, said in a statement that the agreement would ''cut red tape, reduce costs and bring products for health care patients, information technology users and other consumers onto the market faster without compromising quality.'' **********The agreement had been delayed by American concern about reducing the Food and Drug Administration's supervision of European Union-approved pharmaceutical products and medical equipment imported into the United States **********Along with pharmaceutical and medical devices, the agreement covers telecommunications equipment, pleasure boats and electrical goods. **********The European Union said it had also concluded a similar accord with Canada that would cover about one-eighth the amount of trade that the United States agreement would cover."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/16/business/copper-and-coffee-futures-take-a-beating.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-08-16", "snippet": "Copper prices tumble on continuing signs that rising world production and slowing demand are increasing inventories; coffee prices slide (S)", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Copper and Coffee Futures Take a Beating", "print_headline": "Copper and Coffee Futures Take a Beating", "body_text": " **********Copper prices tumbled yesterday on continuing signs that rising world production and slowing demand were increasing inventories. **********On other markets, coffee prices slid. **********Stockpiles in London Metal Exchange warehouses, where most of the world's copper reserves are stored, rose 4,575 metric tons, to 260,875 metric tons, the exchange said yesterday in its daily report.

In Singapore, Ralph-Werner Jaeger, senior vice president of Arianespace for marketing, customer service and international affairs, discussed future business prospects with Michael Richardson of the International Herald Tribune. **********Q. What impact has the boom in satellite communications in Asia in recent years had on Arianespace's business? **********A. Asia is increasingly important as a satellite market. It now represents between 20 percent and 25 percent of our worldwide business. Of the 38 satellite-launch orders on our books worth nearly $3 billion, eight are for the Asia-Pacific market. **********Q. Why are communication satellites for television broadcasting, telephone services and data exchange in such strong demand in Asia? **********A. The region's rapid economic growth and development has called for major improvements in infrastructure of all kinds, including telecommunications. **********Many developing Asian countries have very limited fixed-line telephone services. They may be large continental nations like China and India or widely scattered island states like Indonesia and the Philippines. It would take years and huge expense to extend the cable networks in these countries, especially to remote areas. **********Satellites can provide much quicker and cheaper nationwide coverage for telephony and broadcasting. The diversity of cultures in Asia means that demand for a wide array of satellite television channels catering to different languages and tastes is even stronger than in Europe or the United States. **********Q. How does the Arianespace success rate for launching communications satellites compare with those of rival launchers in the U.S., Russia and China? **********A. Ariane rockets are the leading systems in terms of reliability, followed by Delta and Atlas in the U.S., and Proton in Russia. We have a success rate of about 97 percent. Theirs is around 96 percent. China's success rate is in the vicinity of 80 percent. The Chinese are working hard to improve it. **********Q. What advantages over the current Ariane-4 rocket will the Ariane-5 have for customers when it comes into service in early 1998? **********A. A 3 or 4 percent failure rate for launches is relatively high compared to failure rates of satellites once they are in orbit. Launch failures are costly when you consider that, on average, each rocket carries two satellites insured for as much as $500 million. **********Ariane-5 is designed to give even higher reliability than Ariane-4 and carry heavier and larger payloads. With Ariane-5, we will give customers a launch guarantee that no other rocket operator so far provides. In the very unlikely event of failure, our guarantee provides a relaunch free of charge at a time to suit the customer when the replacement satellite is available. **********Q. There are seven space launch organizations operating in Western Europe, Russia, China, the U.S. and Japan. Isn't that too many for the amount of business likely to be available over the next decade or two? **********A. It depends on how the space launch business develops. Arianespace has so far concentrated on large communication satellites for geostationary orbit high above the equator. We have about 60 percent of the global market for launching such satellites. Our market forecasts show that between 30 and 35 of these satellites will be launched each year over the next decade. **********There is also an emerging market for launching constellations of smaller communication satellites. **********Q. Will there be additional contracts from governments in Europe and elsewhere to launch military satellites for intelligence-gathering, surveillance and arms control? **********A. This is already big business in the U.S., where about 50 percent of Atlas and Delta launches are for the government, mainly for military satellites. For Arianespace, government contracts amount to less than 10 percent of our total business. **********Future space-station building and resupply could open up a major new business avenue for rocket operators."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/27/business/united-asset-buying-stake.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-11-27", "snippet": "United Asset Management Corp says it agreed to acquire significant stake in Integra Capital Management Corp, Toronto-based provider of investment management services (S)", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "United Asset Buying Stake", "print_headline": "United Asset Buying Stake", "body_text": " **********The United Asset Management Corporation said today that it had agreed to acquire a significant stake in the Integra Capital Management Corporation, a Toronto-based provider of investment management services.

The gains in both categories have been handsome, exceeding 40 percent in some cases. **********But a not-so-subtle shift has taken place early this year. After a two-year rally, bonds have been replaced by stocks as the winning investment in the region. **********After all, stocks are supposed to be the riskier, more rewarding investment in good times. And though the bonds have behaved much like stocks in recent years, money managers and financial analysts expect Latin American equities to now have their day in the sun. **********Continued political changes and resurgent local economies created the two-year bull market for bonds and set the stage for this stock rally. Enthusiasm for the stock markets has returned, though not to the frothy levels of 1993 before the Mexican peso crisis, says Juan Carlos Garcia, the head of equity research at Santander Investments in New York. **********To be sure, political risk remains apparent in Ecuador, Peru, Colombia and even Mexico. A political meltdown could occur elsewhere as well. Still, the stability of the governments and their economic policies after the devaluation of the peso in late 1994 has reassured investors. **********Money managers and equity analysts see relatively little risk in the region, barring volatility in the United States -- namely, a sharp increase in interest rates or a plunge by the stock market. **********''The current recovery in equity prices is driven by the improvement in risk perception,'' said Walter Molano, an SBC Warburg economist. **********The performance of the regional stock markets was solid last year, and mutual funds, stocked with blue-chip shares like Telebras, Telefonos de Mexico and Electrobras, performed well. Morgan Stanley's Latin American retail and institutional portfolios were the pace-setters, with gains of more than 46 percent for the 12 months ended on Feb. 14. **********The pace has picked up this year. Every Latin American stock fund tracked by Morningstar had a gain of more than 10 percent for the first six weeks of the year. The leader, Merrill Lynch Latin America, exceeded 17 percent. **********Still, the markets have room to run. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in this country is trading at about 22 times earnings, Brazilian stocks have a p/e ratio of 12.4, Mexican stocks 19.5 and Argentine stocks 24.5, according to State Street Global Advisors, money managers. **********Mr. Garcia of Santander cites overall regional strength as a main reason for optimism. ''For the first time in Latin America, growth is at the same levels in all of the big countries,'' he said. The gross domestic products of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico are growing at 3.5 percent to 5 percent, he said. **********More capital in the area and low valuations in most stock sectors will fuel equity growth, he said. Consumer products and construction sectors, dependent on domestic spending, look more attractive to him than defensive stocks like utilities. **********Other fund managers agree. ''In all of the Latin economies, we've seen strength in the core emerging-markets plays, such as telecom and infrastructure, and the next stage in that progression is for consumers to start spending,'' said Robert Furdak, manager of the State Street Global Advisors Emerging Markets fund. **********THE last couple of years, though, belonged to the region's bond markets. Fidelity New Markets Income returned 42 percent for the 12 months ended Feb. 14, and Bear Stearns Emerging Markets Debt gained 37 percent. **********The bargains found in Latin American debt in early 1995 no longer exist, but investors seeking a high yield will still find better value in the region than in the United States junk-bond market, said David Reiss, an emerging-markets fixed-income portfolio manager at Bankers Trust Global Investment Management. **********Latin debt captured the imagination of investors in 1995, when, despite a hangover from the peso crisis, it rose along with the United States Treasury market. **********Last year, Argentina's commitment to its currency, Brazil's move to keep President Fernando Cardoso in office and the successful international bailout of Mexico made the bonds perform like ''equities in drag,'' said Ali Naqvi, the head of emerging-markets fixed-income research at Citibank Global Asset Management. **********The ride shows no sign of ending.

This time around, it is quadrupling the budget, to $2 million, and introducing the ads to new markets. **********The campaign, the company's only one since it opened for business in 1986, was created by Leibler-Bronfman Lubalin, New York. **********Robert Bock, president of 525 Made in America, originally commissioned the advertising for the fall 1996 season because, he said, ''A lot of people were wearing our things but didn't know our name.'' (The 525 refers to the company's address on Seventh Avenue.) The goal, then and now, was to have ''people remember us,'' Mr. Bock explained. **********Developing brand recognition for the company was paramount, noted Peter Lubalin, creative partner of Leibler-Bronfman Lubalin, because ''these days you are what you wear; people buy by name and not style.'' **********Ads both last fall and this season feature dogs draped in 525 Made in America styles while engaged in human activities. Models in the new campaign are a poodle named Rosie; Jason, a Great Dane, and a bloodhound called Bernard. **********One ad says Rosie, wearing white sunglasses and the manufacturer's apparel while driving a white vintage Corvette, enjoys ''cruising in her latest 525 chenille sweater and scarf.'' A second ad shows Jason, attired in a sweater while reading a newspaper and drinking coffee, spending ''a relaxing Sunday morning dressed in his favorite 525 chenille sweater.'' A third ad, with Bernard wrapped in a throw, sipping brandy, smoking a cigar and reading a newspaper, says the dog is having ''a quiet evening at home enjoying the warmth of a brandy and his favorite 525 chenille throw.'' The tagline for all the ads is ''525 Made in America. For men, for women, for the home. (Dogs optional.)'' **********Mr. Bock said he opted for this strategy because he ''felt it would get our name noticed.'' He added: ''Calvin Klein just wants to shock you with his advertising, flip you out. We want the opposite. We don't want sex, because everybody does that.'' **********The ads are running as full-page spreads in the September issue of Vogue and Elle, the October issue of Elle Decor and House Beautiful and trade publications like DNR, HFN and Home Textiles Today. The manufacturer is buying space this month and next in New York on bus stop shelters, subway platforms and telephone kiosks. It will also advertise outdoors next spring in new markets, most likely Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Francisco. **********The $2 million budget, through next August, will be split between print and outdoor advertising. **********Last year, the campaign definitely caught the attention of retailers. In a review of fashion magazine advertising last September, Women's Wear Daily gave it an honorable mention, along with ads by famous designers with far grander budgets, like Tommy Hilfiger, Isaac Mizrahi and Giorgio Armani. **********The campaign also appears to have given a boost to Mr. Bock's business. He said sales were up 30 percent last year, to $29 million, because ''the product was right and the name was growing.'' He expects sales to exceed $40 million this year. **********To capitalize on the campaign, Mr. Bock opened the first 525 Made in America store in Riverhead, N.Y., in May, and is planning to open others. He is also adding two divisions: holiday knitwear this winter and children's clothing next fall. **********What impact the campaign will have in the future remains to be seen, of course. **********One naysayer is Vicki Ross, a New York retail consultant. She said she did not consider the ads ''1990's advertising,'' adding: ''I don't know if these are effective for the kind of person 525 is going after. This is a very sophisticated audience, and I don't think a dog reaches them. The product is very, very good. I don't think the advertising is that great.'' **********But others are upbeat. **********Alan Millstein, another New York-based retailing consultant, compared the ads to Kenneth Cole's highly regarded advertising for his footwear, a campaign that plays off social and political issues. ''They've got a clever agency and a modest budget, like Kenneth Cole with his advocacy ads,'' he said. ''Cole's ads accomplished the job, and got him recognition.'' **********Mr. Millstein also applauded the humor employed by Leibler-Bronfman Lubalin. ''Humor is rarely used by fashion marketers,'' he said. ''They're uptight, and they have a formula that's boring. Most use a beautiful woman and a world-class photographer in their ads, and then put their name on them.'' **********Dina Turner, the fashion editor for contemporary women's sportswear for the Tobe Report, an industry newsletter, is another booster. **********The fact that the 525 Made in America campaign is ''emblazoned in my mind's eye,'' she said, ''means that it's doing what it's meant to do.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/27/business/treasury-auctions-this-week-include-inflation-indexed-note.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Auctions This Week Include Inflation-Indexed Note", "print_headline": "Treasury Auctions This Week Include Inflation-Indexed Note", "body_text": " **********The Treasury's schedule of financing this week comprises sales of bills and notes, beginning with today's regular weekly auction of three- and six-month bills.

The combination of the two companies, whose brands include Red Lion and Embassy Suites, would create the sixth-largest company in terms of the number of hotels.

Revenue figures include franchising and management fees, which go to the merged company, as well as revenue retained by the franchisees. **********The match of Promus and Doubletree was praised by analysts. **********''The merger combines Promus's historical strength in building and franchising brands, with Doubletree's ability to manage hotels and be an aggressive acquirer of properties,'' said Michael J. Rietbrock, an analyst with Smith Barney. **********The deal values Promus at about $2.1 billion and Doubletree at $1.8 billion. Under the terms of the merger, Promus shareholders will receive 0.925 share in the new company for each of their existing shares. Doubletree shareholders will receive the combined company's stock on a 1-for-1 basis. Based on shares outstanding, Promus shareholders will own about 55 percent of the new company.

The more notable include Hilton Hotels' so-far unsuccessful attempt to take over ITT, the owner of the Sheraton hotel chain, in a hostile $8.3 billion offer; Marriott's recent $1 billion purchase of Renaissance hotels; Doubletree's $1.2 billion purchase of the Red Lion chain, and Starwood Lodging's pursuit of Westin Hotels and Resorts, for which it has offered $1.4 billion. **********Doubletree's brands include Doubletree Hotels, Doubletree Guest Suites and Red Lion hotels, while the Promus brands include Embassy Suites and Hampton Inns and Suites. Together the companies' brands, which will retain their individual identities, range from midpriced, limited-service properties to upscale, full-service establishments. **********Joyce Minor, the lodging analyst for Lehman Brothers, said that Promus had been especially astute at stressing and enforcing quality. ''They're very finnicky about it, and that will benefit both companies,'' she said. **********Franchising accounts for almost 40 percent of Promus's revenue and almost 60 percent of hotel operating profits. A recent analysis by Bear,  Stearns said that three of its four brands ''dramatically outperform their respective brand segments.'' **********Doubletree, Ms. Minor said, is very good at pushing preferred vendor fees, which guarantee member hotels the lowest prices on a range of food, beverages and supplies.

Holbrooke, who was instrumental in negotiating an end to the Bosnian civil war, as a special presidential envoy for Cyprus. **********There have been repeated efforts, all of them unsuccessful, to reach a political settlement on Cyprus, which has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion . But the appointment of Mr. Holbrooke, who will keep his job as an investment banker with Credit Suisse First Boston in New York, is a sign of renewed American seriousness in trying to resolve one of NATO's most potentially destabilizing conflicts as the alliance votes to expand, a senior American official said today. **********Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has said that Cyprus is one of her priorities. Last year relations between Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, were severely strained over disputed islets in the Aegean, and Mr. Holbrooke, then the Assistant Secretary of State for Europe, was deeply involved in talks to ease the crisis. He resigned in February 1996 to join the investment bank, in which he has not had any business involvement with Cyprus, Greece or Turkey, officials said. **********The appointment of ''our toughest negotiator'' represents ''a rebirth and a renewal'' of ''our commitment to help promote a final political settlement on Cyprus,'' said the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, who is scheduled for nomination as the American Ambassador to Greece. **********Mr. Holbrooke, 55, was a strong candidate for Secretary of State in Mr. Clinton's second administration. He will spend about a week every month on Cyprus issues, and will do so without pay, although with the help of a full-time State Department officer. He replaces Richard Beattie, whom Ms. Albright named last month as her adviser on the reorganization of the State Department. **********Reached by telephone in Copenhagen, Mr. Holbrooke said that Cyprus ''along with Bosnia, is the great unresolved flashpoint in Europe.'' While American efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem date back more than 30 years, ''the difference now is that the cold war is over, so cold war restraints have been loosened,'' he said. ''There is a kind of equilibrium now, but not a long-term one.'' **********Last month the Czech President, Vaclav Havel, said that Greece and Turkey would have gone to war at least twice since 1974 if not for their membership in NATO, and Mr. Holbrooke said he agreed. ''But while they are both NATO members, they have not normalized their relations, the way France and Germany did after the war,'' Mr. Holbrooke said. ''And tensions between them generally have been rising since the restraints of the cold war were removed. So it's absolutely necessary for Europe, the United States and the United Nations to try to settle this issue. It's imperative we try, and I'm honored to be asked.'' **********Both the Greeks and Turks, he said, ''need to realize they both can gain by reaching a settlement of the issue that respects both their communities.'' There is further pressure to settle from the European Union, which takes up Cyprus membership next year. **********But Mr. Holbrooke admitted that ''there is a very real question whether political conditions in Ankara, Athens and Nicosia will allow for a settlement.'' **********Next month, the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, will bring together the Greek Cypriot leader, Glafcos Clerides, and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, for their first meeting in nearly three years. **********No one expects rapid agreement, and Mr. Holbrooke said he would wait to see the results of those talks before traveling to the region."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/06/business/h-r-block-s-spots-suggest-that-taxpayer-s-best-friend-one-who-does-taxes.html": {"writer_name": "Shelly Freierman", "pub_date": "1997-01-06", "snippet": "H & R Block's new national advertising campaign presents stories that depict how people really feel about filing taxes; this is Young & Rubicam's first campaign for H & R Block since it was awarded contract last spring (M)", "word_count": 861, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "H & R Block's spots suggest that a taxpayer's best friend is the one who does the taxes.", "print_headline": "H & R Block's spots suggest that a taxpayer's best friend is the one who does the taxes.", "body_text": " **********THE year is so young that people have not yet received all their credit card bills for December's holiday shopping, and many are still adhering to their New Year's resolutions. But, H & R Block Inc. wants everyone to start thinking about taxes, and Block is starting a national advertising campaign next week to get people in an April 15th state of mind. **********The campaign, by the Chicago office of Young & Rubicam, comprises four television and seven radio spots that will run through tax day, with a budget of $15 million. The ads are the first by Young & Rubicam for H & R Block since the agency was awarded the contract last spring. Before that, Bernstein-Rein Advertising of Kansas City, Mo., had the account for 12 years. **********This campaign represents a departure from the days when Henry Bloch, who founded the firm with his brother, Richard, was the company spokesman, and from the more recent campaign that emphasized the overall experience of using H & R Block. The new ads present stories that depict how people really feel about filing taxes. **********All of the spots feature ''Someone to Watch Over Me,'' the 1926 classic song by George and Ira Gershwin, as the underlying theme and closing phrase. According to Brad Most, vice president and management supervisor at Young & Rubicam Chicago, clients want a ''trusting relationship'' with their tax preparer in dealing with the sensitive topic of finances. ''The song captures the caring, soothing emotion that Block wants to convey,'' he said. **********Some of the commercials offer common-sense reasons to draw taxpayers into one of Block's 8,308 offices in the United States. In one television commercial, money is the compelling motivation to turn to a Block tax preparer: the I.R.S. average tax refund is $1,223, but the average Block customer gets $1,408. Smiling recipients are shown opening their refund checks, lighted by a soft yellow light as the refrain ''someone to watch over me'' plays behind the company logo. Another television spot reminds people that such  changes in their lives as marriage, divorce, buying a house or having a baby also change their tax status. **********A fuzzy emotional background may infuse the campaign, but most of the ads offer taxpayers a reminder of the many reasons why they find April the cruelest month, including the possibility of mistakes, complicated forms, audits and confusing math. ''There are a lot of buttons to be pushed in the tax business,'' Eric Steinhouse, senior vice president of marketing for H & R Block, said, ''because everybody has to file taxes.'' **********The campaign portrays the company as protector and helper: phrases like ''highest refund possible,'' ''guarantees of accuracy'' and ''having friends in the tax business'' pepper the spots, but so do such comments as ''nearly two million will have to endure an audit'' and ''the dreaded tax deadline of April 15th.'' **********H & R Block has been using focus-group research to plan its marketing strategies for five years, and last year it conducted a tracking study during the tax season to discern the attitudes of Block clients and noncustomers alike. In general, people are resigned to doing their taxes, but they have lingering doubts about missing out on a full refund and find the task frustrating, Mr. Steinhouse said. ''Preparing taxes is a very emotional process and the consumer is going up against a huge bureaucracy,'' he said. **********H & R Block, which is also based in Kansas City, Mo., already prepares one out of every seven income tax returns, and handled 17.3 million clients worldwide in 1996. In the United States, the company prepared returns for 14.8 million customers and dwarfed its closest competitor, Jackson Hewitt Inc., of Virginia Beach, Va. According to Alexander Paris Jr., a senior investment analyst at Barrington Research Associates Inc. in Chicago, Block had revenues of approximately $831 million from tax preparation in its 1996 fiscal year, compared with Jackson Hewitt's $25 million. **********Block's real ''competition'' is from the 50 million self-sufficient taxpayers, and they are the target audience in this campaign. ''The biggest chunk of tax preparers are self-preparers,'' Mr. Steinhouse said, ''and we're trying to attract them.'' **********Analysts say that Block is fine-tuning its business plans. The company, which has flirted with running a temporary-personnel business and a chain of community legal offices, owns Compuserve and the Block Financial Corporation. Compuserve is an Internet access and on-line provider, and Block Financial offers technology-driven services like  home banking and software for taxes and family legal advice. **********H & R Block is currently expanding its tax-related services, with products like tax-return checking for self-preparers; in-home preparation; refund anticipation loans in a partnership with Beneficial National Bank, and a preparation service aimed at higher-income clients. It is also expanding into such nontax businesses as helping fill out college applications and home will kits. **********Mr. Paris sees the neighborhood Block office as an excellent starting point for sales. When the Block preparer is doing taxes, he can ask the customer if he would be interested in a home equity loan to pay off credit cards or in some other service, Mr. Paris said. ''They want to build upon the trust of the H & R Block brand name,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/11/business/accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "pub_date": "1997-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "Accounts", "body_text": " *********** McCann-Erickson Washington, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos., was awarded an account and becomes the first agency to handle advertising for The Newseum, an interactive museum devoted to news, Rosslyn, Va.

(Her Camera Adored Swastikas)", "body_text": " **********Leni Riefenstahl will be 95 years old on Friday, and if she imagined the years would diminish the stigma she accumulated 60 years ago and more as Hitler's favored movie-maker, then she was -- apparently -- wrong. **********When an exhibit of her work -- the first in postwar Germany -- opened here last week, the focus was on those denouncing her roots in the Third Reich and on a debate about a particularly troubled corollary: can art that grew in such soil ever transcend its origins? **********''The discussion is, in fact, more interesting than the exhibit,'' said Andreas Schluter, who arranged the exhibit of 50 colored postwar photographs and black-and-white prewar film clips at his second-floor gallery  close to Hamburg's main railroad station. **********Ms. Riefenstahl has staked out her own position in the debate. ''Can art be separated from politics?'' she said in a telephone interview from her home on the Starnbergersee in Bavaria. ''If an artist is possessed by his art, then he does not have the possibility to do anything else.'' **********An admiring Adolf Hitler sought  out the filmmaker to direct what has been termed the most notorious documentary ever filmed -- ''Triumph of the Will'' -- a depiction of the Nazi Party rally that became a central motif of Hitler's dictatorship. **********In scenes that have chilled subsequent generations, the documentary shows the massed banners and uplifted faces of Hitler's devoted followers marching by his podium. Yet, Ms. Riefenstahl insisted today, ''it was only a documentary. It could be used for propaganda purposes, but I didn't make it as propaganda.'' Indeed, she recalled, the film won a major award as a documentary in Paris in 1937. **********''Triumph of the Will'' was followed by her renowned documentary coverage of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, ''Olympia,'' cementing her reputation as a documentary-maker entwined with the Nazi ideology of Aryan supremacy. So close was the association that Time magazine, she recalled, once referred to her erroneously as Hitler's girlfriend. **********At the core of the argument over the exhibition, of course, is postwar Germany's unresolved fixation with its history that seems to trip modern Germans at every turn: only last week, two conscripts were discharged from the German Army after an arson attack on a home for foreigners, a development that raised worrisome questions about screening military recruits for right-wing sympathies; and even this week, Government officials are negotiating with Jewish officials over compensation payments to Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe. **********Almost routinely, the past rears up -- in high-school courses and histories -- with the warning that it should not be repeated. **********But, at Mr. Schluter's gallery here, the discussion is tinged with a further question: is there a statute of limitations, so to speak, for those, like Ms. Riefenstahl, who spent three years after World War II in American and French internment camps and who underwent the process known as denazification, through which Germans were supposed to equip themselves to begin anew? **********''This is really a significant question,'' Mr. Schluter said in an interview during which he acknowledged deep admiration for Ms. Reifenstahl's work, first as a filmmaker in the 1930's and then as a photographer in the postwar era. (Even today, despite her years, she is working on a deep-sea video reflecting her fascination with submarine themes.  She learned to dive more than 20 years ago when she was in her 70's. Three days after her birthday, she plans a diving trip to Hawaii to work on her next film.) **********''For 50 years, Leni Riefenstahl has been working with photography,'' said Mr. Schluter, who is 36.  ''There is a postwar person here and perhaps one can make a distinction'' between that person and the prewar movie-maker. **********Even then, Ms. Riefenstahl challenges the stereotype of herself as what Mr. Schluter described as ''a synonym for the Third Reich.'' **********About the Holocaust, she says: ''I did not know what was going on. I did not know anything about these things.'' Accordingly, she said, referring to the Nazi ideology, ''I distance myself from all that.'' **********Ms. Riefenstahl's rise to pre-eminence among German movie-makers began in 1932 when she directed ''The Blue Light,'' the story of an innocent mountain girl, which reflected the interest in mountain themes she had discovered starring in Arnold Fanck's dramatic movies. It was that film that caught Hitler's eye and led him to ask her to make ''Triumph of the Will.'' **********Ms. Riefenstahl says she had begun to have doubts about Hitler -- whom at first she greatly admired -- in 1937 because his views on art conflicted with hers. **********The war, in effect, ended her movie-making. **********Detained from 1945 to 1948, she said today, she repeatedly insisted to her captors that she had not been a Nazi Party member and had ''never uttered an anti-Semitic phrase and was never a racist.'' **********Nonethless, her past caught up with her: no one would hire her to make movies. And even when she turned to color photography and traveled to the Sudan to take a series of photographs of Nubians, which appeared in book form in the 1970's, she was again accused of pursuing the ''fascist aesthetic'' of glorification of the male body. **********''Absolute nonsense,'' she said today. **********Her work has been exhibited in Japan and Italy -- where it also drew protests in Milan -- but the Hamburg exhibit is the first in Germany. Though she had had other offers, she said, she accepted Mr. Schulter's because she found him agreeable. For his part, the gallery owner said he had conceived the exhibition as a great admirer of Ms. Riefenstahl's work. Pointedly, there are no stills from ''Triumph of the Will'' in the exhibit. **********Critically, the exhibit has inspired a huge surge of interest in Ms. Riefenstahl and her work. She has been interviewed for most of Germany's major weekly publications -- Der Spiegel, Stern and Die Zeit, for instance. But the attention has not always been flattering. Interviewers have again pursued her association and fascination with Hitler, critics have challenged the merit of her photography, which also includes underwater photographs of coral reefs. Other, older Germans, Mr. Schluter said, have left the exhibit in a nostalgic and sympathetic mood. **********None of this amounts to a formal rehabilitation. No public officials attended the exhibit's opening. ''I absolutely cannot imagine that I did something unjust,'' Ms. Riefenstahl said in one published interview. ''What crime did I commit?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/07/business/company-briefs-489484.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********AVIATION SALES CO., Miami, an aircraft spare parts company, agreed to acquire the assets of Kratz-Wilde Machine Company, a Cincinnati-based manufacturer of jet engine, auto and faucet components, for about $42.5 million. **********COVENANT TRANSPORT INC., Chattanooga, Tenn., a long-haul truckload carrier, has agreed to acquire Bud Meyer Truck Lines Inc., a provider of temperature-controlled transportation services, for an undisclosed amount of cash."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/16/business/rayovac-picks-young-rubicam.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-01-16", "snippet": "Rayovac Corp has selected Chicago office of Young & Rubicam Inc to handle its account, which had been handled by FCB/Leber Katz Partners unit of True North Communications in New York for 14 years; billings estimated at $15 million (S)", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rayovac Picks Young & Rubicam", "print_headline": "Rayovac Picks Young & Rubicam", "body_text": " **********The Rayovac Corporation, the battery maker in Madison, Wis., said yesterday that it had selected the Chicago office of Young & Rubicam Inc. to handle its account, which had been handled by the FCB/Leber Katz Partners unit of True North Communications in New York for 14 years.

Radio Deal", "body_text": " **********After approving more than 1,000 radio station mergers since Federal rules were liberalized nearly two years ago, the Justice Department filed suit today to block one for the first time. **********In a civil complaint filed in United States District Court in Brooklyn, the  department said that the plan by the Chancellor Media Corporation to acquire four popular Long Island radio stations would undercut competition, drive up radio advertising fees and result in higher costs to consumers in the area. Chancellor had planned to acquire the stations from SFX Broadcasting Inc., swapping them for two stations in Jacksonville, Fla., and $11 million. **********Chancellor, which now owns two stations on Long Island, said that acquiring the four that SFX owned would help it compete with other media and with larger stations based in New York City. **********But Charles E. Biggio, senior counsel in the Justice Department antitrust division, said the deal ''would end the competitive battle'' for radio advertising in Long Island's Suffolk County. The Justice Department  complaint said the deal would for the first time create a single dominant Long Island radio group, with more than 65 percent of the local radio advertising market. **********Chancellor would acquire SFX's  WBLI-FM, WBAB-FM, WHFM-FM and WGBB-AM. The deal is part of a wave of mergers resulting from the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996. Congress in effect authorized the rapid consolidation in the radio industry by relaxing Federal Communications Commission restrictions on the number of radio stations held by any one owner. **********Since then, Government officials have said, more than 4,000 of the  11,000 radio stations in the nation have changed hands. There have been more than 1,000 merger deals, including more than 140 large enough to be reported to the Justice Department's antitrust division for review. **********The Justice Department objected to eight previous deals. In five cases, it reached settlements that resolved the competitive concerns, often requiring some stations to be sold off. Three other deals were restructured or abandoned. **********Government and private lawyers in the Long Island dispute seemed to agree that the lawsuit did not represent a hardening of the Justice Department's antitrust approach to the  wave of radio station mergers, but was a fight over competitive position in a superheated market. **********''Our position toward these transactions has been consistent,'' Mr.  Biggio said. ''This is the first case where the parties have been unable to resolve our concerns.'' **********In addition to seeking to halt the deal, the Justice Department action, which resulted in part from complaints by advertisers, is aimed at trying to stop a temporary marketing arrangement in which Chancellor has been operating SFX's Long Island stations. **********The Justice Department focused on three Long Island stations that it said together dominated the ratings  on Long Island among adults 25 to 54 years of age, who are most important to Suffolk County advertisers.  The three are WALK-FM, an adult contemporary station already owned by Chancellor, and two SFX stations: WBLI, another adult contemporary station, and WBAB, an adult-oriented rock station. **********Quoting internal corporate documents, the Justice Department said that a WALK sales director had written that the acquisition would bring an end to the bitter competition between Chancellor and SFX that had afforded advertisers ''fire sale rates.'' The Government said that a Chancellor executive had exulted after the deal was first reached that ''the war is won.'' **********Government lawyers said they had concentrated on the anti-competitive effect of the deal. **********''Allowing Chancellor to buy a dominant position in this concentrated market will result in higher radio advertising prices for Suffolk County businesses that rely on radio to sell their products and services,'' said Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division. **********But Chancellor representatives said that the Government erred in failing to acknowledge how the new group of radio stations under one ownership could also offer benefits to advertisers. Edward P. Henneberry, an antitrust lawyer for Chancellor, said that the group of stations would provide a competitive alternative to expensive New York City radio stations, cable television stations or even newspapers. **********''The Government didn't mention the strong pro-competitive benefit that you get from radio consolidation that allows this group to compete more directly with other advertisers,'' Mr. Henneberry said. ''We think this is an overgeneralization and we disagree with it -- a lot of people on Long Island listen to New York radio stations.'' **********Katie Bachman, editor of Radio Business Reports, an industry newsletter, echoed that view, adding that there was no evidence that ad rates had increased since the nationwide consolidation wave began. **********Chancellor, which is based in Irving, Tex., owns 95 radio stations in 21 major American markets, including 12 of the largest markets. SFX is based in New York City and owns or operates 85 radio stations in 23 cities. Chancellor is a recently formed media group consisting of the Evergreen Media Corporation, the Chancellor Broadcasting Company and the former radio group of Viacom International Inc. **********Chancellor's largest shareholder, with an 18 percent stake, is the investment partnership of Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, a Dallas buyout firm. Hicks, Muse also agreed in August to acquire SFX in a $1.2 billion deal that is unaffected by the  action today by the Justice Department. **********Like Chancellor, other big radio companies like the Westinghouse Broadcasting Corporation and Jacor Communications have embraced consolidation with a vengeance. **********The Telecommunications Act now allows station owners to amass as many as eight stations in a single market, presumably with a greater share of the audience.

''You think you are not addicted to her, but, all of a sudden, she is taken away from you and you realize that, unwillingly, you are.'' **********Others in Times Square, even those who have never lived in or even traveled to England, expressed a similar sentiment. For so long, Diana's name and image have been part of many people's lives that they simply could not let her go without one last look. **********One of those was Constantinos Mavris, a cab driver for 24 of his 54 years, who suddenly put on the brakes on Broadway when he saw the picture of Diana on the giant screen just before the funeral procession began. Technically, he was in the heart of his shift, which ended at 6 A.M., but, he said, Diana's funeral was more important. **********''I was never lucky enough to meet her. I've met Meg Ryan and a couple of Rockettes and Margot Kidder, but I never gave the Princess a ride anywhere. I would have loved to,'' he said. ''I wouldn't have charged her, that's for sure.'' **********By 6 A.M., feet hurting and necks sore from looking up to the screen for hours, some people began to gather in circles and talk to each other. **********''We don't have anything like this in Kansas City, I can tell you that,'' said John P. Soulis, 31, a private detective who came to New York on Friday to accompany a friend on business. ''People watching television in the middle of the street would be a very strange sight in Kansas City.'' **********Mr. Soulis said he had decided to go to Times Square on a whim in the middle of the night to ''soak up in the atmosphere.'' Upon arriving at 1 A.M., he saw a television crew setting up cameras, found out that the funeral would be broadcast and decided to stay. Five hours later, he looked at his wrist watch and realized he had not slept in 26 hours. **********No matter, he said, it was the least he could do for Diana. ''She was a beautiful lady,'' he said in a whisper. ''Besides, now I can say that I was part of history. I saw her funeral in Times Square.'' **********For Mr. Soulis, there was a sweet irony to his happening upon the televised images of Diana. He was an eighth grader when Diana married Prince Charles in 1981. He remembers getting up early in the morning to watch that ceremony. Since then, Diana has fascinated him. **********It was the same for Elia Guzman, an Upper East Side nanny. Ms. Guzman, 55, set her alarm clock early yesterday to make sure she did not miss a minute of the Princess's funeral. She watched it alone, in the darkness of her Washington Heights apartment because her roommate, Maria de los Angeles Alberto, was too sleepy to share the experience with her. **********''I saw the wedding, I have read all the magazines, I have her pictures, I know all about her life,'' Ms. Guzman said. ''I would not miss this for the world. I feel I owe it to her.'' **********Ms. Guzman is so enthralled by Diana that she asked her boss, who is in England on business, to sign her name in the condolence books that people have been standing in line for hours in London to sign. **********''I hope he does,'' Ms. Guzman said. ''It would mean a lot to me.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/19/business/japan-reports-trade-surplus-soared-in-april.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-05-19", "snippet": "Japan's Finance Ministry reports that country's merchandise trade surplus rose $163.7 percent from year-earlier month, or $7.23 billion; rise is second in last three months, following nearly three years of declines; Japan's trade surplus with Unit...", "word_count": 350, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Reports Trade Surplus Soared in April", "print_headline": "Japan Reports Trade Surplus Soared in April", "body_text": " **********Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose sharply in April as auto makers and others cranked up exports to compensate for slower growth in domestic demand after the Government raised the national consumption tax, economists said today. **********The surplus increased 163.7 percent from the corresponding month a year earlier to 831.48 billion yen, or $7.23 billion, the Finance Ministry said.

''And this has put the brakes on.'' **********Indeed, across a spectrum from industry representatives to Government ministers, the assessment was gloomy. ''The chance to make Germany more attractive in the international race for investment was frittered away,'' said the Economics Minister, Gunther Rexrodt. **********Neither was the comparison with Washington lost on commentators. **********''Two worlds,'' said the Frankfurter Allgemeine, a conservative daily. ''With pragmatic common sense, the Americans presented themselves with a reduction of capital taxes to keep their economy on the upswing; in Germany, a tax reform that would have offered a realistic chance to the unemployed has collapsed on ideological divisions.'' **********The German tax reform, which Chancellor Helmut Kohl labeled ''the reform of the century,'' centered on a Government proposal to cut $16 billion worth of taxes, in part by lowering the top-end income tax rate from 53 percent to 39 percent and the starting rate from 25.9 percent to 15 percent. The Government proposal also foresaw a reduction of an income tax surcharge for the staggering costs of German reunification from 7.5 to 5.5 percent. **********The aim was to encourage investment and thus stimulate jobs in an economy where unemployment exceeds one million people, or 11 percent of the work force. **********The opposition Social Democrats, with a majority both in the upper house of Parliament and on the mediation committee that met for 15 hours on Wednesday, blocked the package, saying its terms favored the rich. Not only that, the opposition's own counterproposal to lower Germany's prohibitive labor costs in return for increases in the value-added tax and the fuel tax now seems certain to be voted down by the Government majority in the lower house. **********The result: political paralysis and, according to Arnold Willemsen, a spokesman for the Federal Association of Germany Industry, ''catastrophic implications'' for Germany's record-level unemployment and ''a signal to German investors to take their money abroad and to foreign investors to avoid Germany even more.'' **********For Mr. Riba, 29, in his design office in this leafy backwater 25 miles south of Bonn, the tribulations seemed ominously familiar: It was a combination of high costs and global pressures that turned his family's business from a substantial manufacturer of clothing-industry machinery employing 70 workers to a modest studio with just two full-time employees -- a parable of German costs and complacency at a time of global economic change. **********When its American marketing partner pulled out under disputed circumstances two and a half years ago, Mr. Riba said the company, founded in 1947, was left to fend for itself in a world that had changed radically. **********The company's patented machinery designs, it turned out, had been copied in Poland and Greece, Mr. Riba said in an interview. The clothing industry had moved away from Germany because of high labor costs to places where it was cheaper -- Romania, Turkey, the former Yugoslavia and parts of southeast Asia. **********''As Germans, we had been so arrogant,'' Mr. Riba said. ''We ranked No. 2 in the world as exporters. But we lost sight of the world market and realized too late that our competitors had not been sitting still.'' **********When the banks demanded repayment of loans worth some $800,000, the company -- Dipl. Ing. Riba G.m.b.H. -- was left with 26 full-time employees it could not afford to dismiss because of the high severance pay mandated by German law. **********It declared bankruptcy last September, sold off manufacturing plants and office buildings and was reborn this year as Ralf Riba Design, with one small workshop, one rented design studio and two full-time employees -- Mr. Riba and an assistant. Start-up cost: $30,000. **********Although Mr. Riba has never visited the United States, his formula seems a microcosm of American economic restructuring. In a land where social contributions devour 40 percent of gross salaries, he employs a designer and technical staff as freelancers so that he does not have to pay those outlays. Rather than maintain costly work space, Mr. Riba subcontracts labor to four independent shops. **********''We don't want mass markets,'' he said. ''We want niche markets for new ideas.'' Apart from the Empire State Building look-alikes, about 100 of which have been sold as decorative objects or CD racks for around $1,200 each, his company also produces a device to measure the conductivity of building materials, costing roughly $80,000 each. The future, he said, is in high-tech innovation. **********Such thinking might be profitable in the United States. But in Germany, steep taxes and the world's highest labor costs inhibit companies like Mr. Riba's that simply are not big enough to transfer production plants abroad, as many bigger German companies have. **********''It's worse for small companies than big ones,'' said Mr. Willemsen of the Federal Association of German Industry. ''The big firms have made their investments abroad and even the bigger medium-sized firms have begun to move abroad. The smaller firms find this difficult. They stay here and remain under the tax-yoke.

His reasoning was that cardholders were liable only for the first $50 of fraudulent use and that there were more important financial matters on which to dwell. **********Cardholders may still have far greater worries, but they probably should be more concerned about fraud and security than when that advice was offered nearly 20 years ago. The number of cards in use and the amount spent on them by consumers has grown substantially. **********Just as important, there are more ways to spend money with cards \u2014 at cash machines, over the telephone and the Internet, and soon through electronic wallets that serve as cash surrogates \u2014 and fraud techniques are becoming more varied and sophisticated. **********Fraud and theft amount to about 10 cents on every $100 that cardholders charge, but because card use is so pervasive, this adds up to more than $1 billion a year just for cards issued by banks under the two largest brands, Visa and MasterCard. Total card fraud is considerably higher when American Express, Diners Club and the many types of department-store and oil-company cards are included. **********Cardholders are still liable only for nominal amounts charged illegally in their name. But ultimately the money lost to card issuers and the money they spend trying to prevent further thefts comes out of the pockets of their cardholders or, if competition is too steep, their shareholders. **********Theft comes in many guises. There are the most crude forms, such as stealing someone's wallet or reading a cardholder's personal identification number at a cash machine and then taking the card. Some more artful crooks intercept new cards before they can be delivered in the mail. And then there are techno-literate thieves, who try to hack into computer networks to steal the card numbers of on-line shoppers. **********Fortunately, there is a vast, sophisticated arsenal with which to combat such crime. A relatively simple procedure is to print cardholders' photographs on cards, which has proven \"very successful in cutting down point-of-sale fraud,\" said Keith Saunders, chief architect for security and electronic commerce at NCR Corp., which makes cash machines and security systems. **********Including a photo, he said, \"increases the risk of getting caught and makes criminals feel uneasy.\" **********The biggest innovation in anti-theft technology is the smart card, which is also called the chip card because an embedded silicon chip allows far more information to be stored than on a card with a conventional magnetic stripe. **********While a stripe card might contain a PIN and not much else, chip cards are being developed with enough room to store a digitized version of the cardholder's thumbprint. Another advantage is that it is harder to snatch information off a smart card. **********\"If you had the right equipment, you could copy a stripe card,\" Mr. Saunders said. \"When you move into smart cards, the equipment is much less available and much more expensive, and the level of expertise is much higher. Remanufacturing a silicon chip is a fairly complex operation. **********\"Typically, only big companies and universities have that equipment,\" he added, \"and information is put into a chip that makes it difficult to know what to copy and what to look for. If you don't do it just right, you destroy the chip.\" **********Smart cards are being introduced gradually around the world. Ciaran Brennan, editor of the industry newsletter Cards International, noted that in countries where it has been in widespread use, such as France, banks \"have been able to reduce card fraud quite substantially and now other countries are looking to introduce chip cards.\" **********He said that they were viewed somewhat as the future of card security. **********Smart-card technology will eventually allow banks to provide cards that can serve both as credit cards and electronic wallets, with stored-up cash that can be used for small purchases and replenished at banks when the cash runs out. The goal, Mr. Brennan said, is \"to take cash out of society and bring in electronic payment cards, with the added benefit of reducing fraud.\" **********In a card security system, Mr. Saunders said, \"ideally what you want is something you possess, something you know and something you are.\" **********The first is a PIN, the second is the card itself and the third could be a thumbprint. **********Cards that read thumbprints are deemed especially useful in emerging economies, where card use is increasing rapidly and fraud is far higher than in traditional markets. Visa reported that card fraud in Latin America last year was six times as great as in Europe and Asia as a percentage of sales and twice as great as in North America. **********Thumbprint identification overcomes the limitations of literacy and familiarity with computers that exist in emerging markets. The system is not foolproof, however. There have been gruesome cases in South Africa where thieves have separated cardholders from their cards as well as from their thumbs. Newer technology requires the thumb connected with a card to have a pulse. **********Another identification procedure being tested and likely to be on the market in a few years involves reading the irises of cardholders' eyes, which are even more idiosyncratic than fingerprints. **********All is not lost once a card is stolen. Credit-scoring agencies, which banks use to decide who should and should not get credit, have developed programs for spotting spending patterns with a high probability of indicating fraudulent use. **********Technology designed by Fair, Isaac & Co., a large credit scorer, looks for such telltale signs as large transactions out of a cardholder's home area soon after an account is open, especially stores that carry expensive merchandise such as electronics and jewelry. **********Cardholders are increasingly making purchases all over the world while they are sitting in their living rooms. A priority of card issuers is to develop technology that keeps hackers from grabbing card information transmitted over the Internet. **********This includes encryption procedures that scramble communications between cardholders and merchants and make use of a \"digital signature.\" That involves the cardholder entering a bit of information, such as a PIN, which unlocks the flow of information to the merchant. **********The next step, being tested in a joint program by Visa and MasterCard, is the use of \"secured electronic transactions.\" A sort of software wallet bundled into Internet browser software on personal computers will allow information to be sent to merchants, who can then send it to cardholders' banks for approval. **********Future models are expected to encode the information on the cards themselves, so that nothing can be gleaned by stealing a cardholder's computer. **********A crucial advantage of secured electronic transactions over other encryption software is that only the banks will be able to read the card information, not the merchants being patronized, Mr. Saunders said. So there will be no need to tear up virtual carbons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/21/business/media-business-advertising-challenge-getting-shoppers-try-untried-final-focus-ad.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-10-21", "snippet": "Advertising column reports on final sessions of 88th annual conference of Assn of National Advertisers; says focus was on daunting challenge posed by getting skeptical shoppers to try the untried--particularly in continuously changing technology m...", "word_count": 1049, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The challenge of getting shoppers to try the untried is the final focus of an ad conference.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; The challenge of getting shoppers to try the untried is the final focus of an ad conference.", "body_text": " **********THE daunting challenge posed by getting skeptical shoppers to try the untried -- particularly in the continuously changing technology market -- was the focus of the final sessions of the 88th annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers. **********Attendees at the conference, which ended last night at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel here, heard impassioned pleas for risk taking and experimentation from marketers in fields ranging from banking and technology to consumer products and telecommunications. **********''Brands will be the short cut'' to woo consumers, said Carl F. Pascarella, president and chief executive of Visa U.S.A. Inc., because ''with a trusted brand, the consumer can cut through the clutter.'' **********''This is going to be more important in the future,'' he added, ''with the growth of new technologies and the explosion of electronic commerce.'' Visa, for instance, is testing so-called smart cards, or cards with computer chips that can store values of money and data, which are intended to supplant cash or checks in retail transactions. **********''Today, your Visa card resides in your wallet,'' Mr. Pascarella said. ''Tomorrow, your Visa card will be your wallet.'' **********As consumer-oriented marketers like Visa become more technologically oriented, technology marketers are becoming more consumer oriented. **********''As our market has broadened we've had to evolve our advertising,'' said Ann Lewnes, worldwide advertising director of the Intel Corporation, to emphasize ''a much more approachable way to talk about technology.'' **********Ms. Lewnes shared a series of television commercials by the Intel agency, the Euro RSCG Dahlin Smith White unit of Havas Advertising, centered on ''bunny people'' -- chip makers in protective suits who in less than a year have become ''pivotal characters,'' she said, symbolizing Intel products like the Pentium II microprocessor. **********A coming commercial shows bunny people dancing to ''Shake Your Groove Thing'' with the Rockettes in Times Square, Ms. Lewnes said, and bean-bag-style dolls based on the bunny people are even being sold on the Intel World Wide Web site. **********The Microsoft Corporation is unlikely any time soon to sell dolls resembling William H. Gates, its chairman and chief executive, particularly to any Federal antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department, which took strong actions against Microsoft yesterday. But Robert J. Herbold, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Microsoft, portrayed the company in his remarks at the conference as struggling as much as any of its competitors to determine how best to peddle its wares. **********''We've done a lot of things that have worked,'' said Mr. Herbold, a former technology and marketing executive at the Procter & Gamble company, ''and some things that haven't.'' **********For instance, Mr. Herbold said, when Microsoft began television advertising aimed at general audiences in 1994, ''it was somewhat disappointing in the beginning'' because the commercials were ''kind of cold and didn't show people using personal computers or the results of using personal computers.'' **********The following year, he added, Microsoft decided it needed ''a brand proposition,'' which would define its software as a product that ''leads the way in providing access to a new world of thinking and communicating.'' The commercials became warmer and more emotional, like a new spot by Wieden & Kennedy, the Microsoft agency, that shows how the truck maker Freightliner uses Microsoft software to custom-build trucks for customers. **********Customization is important, said Scott Bedbury, vice president for marketing at the Starbucks Coffee Company, because all too often ''consumers don't truly believe there's a huge difference between products.'' **********The solution, said Mr. Bedbury, a former worldwide advertising director of Nike Inc., who describes himself as ''a bit of a brand nut,'' is to ''establish emotional ties'' between brands and consumers because ''people's hearts are far more powerful than their brains.'' **********For instance, Mr. Bedbury described how Starbucks coddles ''what we call our early customers, our pre-caffeinated customers,'' who often ''come into our stores in Manhattan at 6:30 before they even shave or shower.'' **********''We have a great product,'' Mr. Bedbury said, ''but we don't stop there. We offer a 'value proposition' based in large part on how it feels when you walk into a store.'' **********To deepen those feelings, Mr. Bedbury said, Starbucks plans a ''major drive'' for the coming holiday season, to seek donations from customers ''to put a book in the hands of a needy child.'' The goal, he added, will be one million books. **********Another marketer agreed with Mr. Bedbury's assessment of the difficulties of tending to newer brands. **********''You have to steward a brand, try to protect it,'' said Tim Kelly, vice president for advertising sponsorship and media of the Sprint Corporation. ''One of the key assets of a long-distance company like ours is to have a national, well perceived brand.'' **********The tumult in the long-distance category -- executive changes at the AT&T Corporation and a takeover battle involving the MCI Communications Corporation -- presents a unique challenge for Sprint. **********''As a marketing person, you've got to stay focused on the business,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''and not allow all that to distract you.'' For example, Sprint is proceeding with a sponsorship of the current Bridges to Babylon tour of the Rolling Stones, for which the company paid an estimated $5 million. **********The conference also featured the presentation of the second annual Casie Awards for effective interactive advertising and marketing. Casie is the Coalition for Advertiser Supported Information and Entertainment, formed by the Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies. **********The Betty Crocker Web site of General Mills Inc., was named Best Advertiser Web site for products costing under $100. And the Web site of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company was named best advertiser Web site for products costing more than $100. The Betty Crocker site was developed by Rare Medium and the Hancock site by Modem Media, part of True North Communications. **********The Station@Sony.com, part of the Sony Web site, won for best interactive campaign.

And the Treasury Department opposes the idea more strongly, officials said, warning that the sanctions might even undermine investor confidence in the Mexican economy. **********''Mexico is our third-largest trading partner,'' a White House official cautioned. ''Something like this would involve so many businesses, entities and individuals there -- it's just a much more complicated task than with Colombia.'' **********Good for Colombia, But Not for Mexico **********A former senior law-enforcement official who took part in discussions about the sanctions and spoke about them on the condition that he not be identified, explained the Administration's reticence differently. **********''This is one more case of selective application of the rules,'' he said. ''What is fine for Colombia is not O.K. for Mexico.'' **********Other officials gave some weight to both views. As a practical obstacle, they noted that the United States Government had much less specific information about the front companies and legitimate holdings of drug smugglers in Mexico than it did about those of Colombians. **********At the same time, the officials noted that the United States agency responsible for imposing the sanctions, the Treasury Department, had been the most insistent voice within the Government warning that they might pose a danger for legitimate business interests in Mexico. **********President Clinton announced the crackdown on Colombian traffickers with considerable fanfare, in an October 1995 speech marking the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. ''We must not allow them to wash the blood off profits from the sale of drugs,'' he said. **********Since then, the effort has received little public attention in the United States. In Colombia, however, each new development in the program referred to as ''the Clinton list'' and ''the American blockade'' has been front-page news. **********The sanctions were levied under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which authorizes penalties in case of an ''unusual and extraordinary threat to national security.'' The same authority was invoked to stop Americans from doing businesses with the Panamanian leadership of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and to freeze Iranian assets after Americans were taken hostage in Teheran. **********The Practical Results Of Freezing Assets **********The executive order issued for Colombia allows the Government to freeze any assets under United States jurisdiction that belong wholly or in part to four principal figures in the Cali cocaine cartel or to nearly 300 of their relatives and associates who have been named on a list of ''specially designated narcotics traffickers.'' **********Because the traffickers are thought to have few identifiable properties in the United States, the main effect of the program comes from its secondary provisions. Those make it illegal for American citizens and companies to do business with the 126 Colombian companies -- from poultry farms to cosmetics manufacturers -- that have been explicitly linked to the cartel. Violators risk prison terms as long as 10 years and fines of $500,000 for corporations and $250,000 for individuals. **********None of the cases brought against the traffickers have yet been tested in court. But American and Colombian officials pointed to signs that the hundreds of warning letters sent to American companies by the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control have at least disrupted the traffickers' business empires. **********The sanctions ''have had a profound impact'' on the cartel leaders, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Thomas A. Constantine, told Congress last year, limiting ''their ability to conduct business in both the national and international marketplaces.'' **********Colombian banks, threatened with the loss of access to the United States financial system, have closed some accounts tied to the traffickers and tightened some regulations. The Colombian Attorney General's office and the Colombian equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission have opened investigations into some of the businesses cited by the Treasury Department. **********Colombian companies like Drogas La Rebaja, a huge chain of discount drugstores owned by relatives of the jailed cartel leader Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, have lost both bankers and wholesale suppliers. And though subsidiaries of some American manufacturers have continued to feed the blacklisted companies through intermediaries, the pressure has been sufficient to bring relatives of the traffickers out of the shadows to complain. **********Unbearable Tension In Being a Rodriguez **********''Being a Rodriguez these days is worse than having AIDS,'' Mr. Rodriguez's oldest son, William, told a Colombian newsmagazine last year. **********The executive director of the Colombian-American Chamber of Commerce, Joseph A. Finnin, said in a telephone interview from Bogota that since the sanctions, major Colombian companies, as well as American ones, are being careful about whom they deal with. ''They don't want their names alongside those on the list,'' Mr. Finnin said. **********There is some evidence that the sanctions have essentially become a kind of tax on the traffickers' aboveboard holdings -- an inconvenience rather than a serious threat. **********Greg Passic, a special agent at the Treasury Department's money-laundering intelligence center, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, said the threat of sanctions had prompted Cali operatives to get rid of some of their holdings. But he said that with other assets, they had changed their ownership, at least on paper. **********The director of the Treasury's foreign assets office, R. Richard Newcomb, acknowledged as much. ''But those new companies are not mainstream; they are underground,'' he said in an interview. ''It gets more and more raggedy, and as they do that, we will identify the new front companies they set up and put them on the list.'' **********American officials are generally less sanguine in assessing the potential of similar sanctions against major traffickers in Mexico. Mr. Newcomb declined to address the subject at all. Other officials said the problem of intelligence information loomed especially large. **********The actions taken against Colombian traffickers, their associates and their businesses may not have been challenged in court because they have unusually strong evidence backing them up: Law-enforcement officials said the sanctions were largely based on thousands of documents and computer files captured in the long series of raids that landed most of the cartel leaders in prison in the summer of 1995. **********By contrast, officials said, United States law-enforcement and intelligence agencies know far less about the aboveboard holdings of traffickers in Mexico. Much of what the agencies do have, they added, is information that government lawyers would be loath to present in court -- either because it is only partly corroborated or because it could expose the methods used to collect it. **********Scant Data on Mexicans Limit Enforcement **********Miguel Rodriguez and his brother, Gilberto, in particular, also went to great lengths to set up their children and other relatives in legitimate business. Mexican traffickers are often more circumspect about their place in society, hiding their assets in labyrinths of lawyers, front companies and phantom associates. **********The expected nomination of Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, an Assistant Attorney General in charge of the criminal division in the Reagan Administration, as the next Ambassador to Mexico is seen by some analysts as a boost for cooperative investigative operations. **********Nevertheless, ''determining who is inside the circle and who is outside -- through court records, business records and everything else, is a lot tougher in Mexico,'' said a former senior law-enforcement official who has conducted investigations there. ''There are just so many cutouts.'' **********Senior Clinton Administration officials worried recently that even the symbolic refusal to certify Mexico as cooperative in fighting drugs could imperil the Mexican economic recovery, to which President Clinton has committed billions of dollars in credit and considerable political capital. **********Yet some officials predicted that as the Administration focused more closely on the traffickers' growing economic power in Mexico, it would become harder and harder to avoid doing there as it has done in Colombia. **********Mexico's traffickers, they noted, are more dependent on the United States economy and thus potentially more vulnerable. They are more closely tied to the American financial system. They like to keep homes in areas like San Diego and south Texas. **********''There is a lot of evidence out there that these people are extremely wealthy, extremely influential, and enough of a threat to the United States for the President to include them on the list,'' a senior law-enforcement official said. ''It's a natural extension of the policy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/15/world/us-senate-votes-to-let-russia-shift-troops.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Schmitt", "pub_date": "1997-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 511, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Senate Votes to Let Russia Shift Troops", "print_headline": "U.S. Senate Votes to Let Russia Shift Troops", "body_text": " **********The Senate unanimously agreed today to amend a 1990 treaty governing conventional forces in Europe to allow Russia to keep more heavy weapons for a longer time around sensitive southern republics like Chechnya. **********The 100-to-0 vote showed the strong bipartisan support for altering the agreement, which has led to the destruction or removal of 53,000 non-nuclear weapons in Europe since the treaty took effect five years ago.

But it was really an amalgam of efforts that featured a collaboration of political activists in China and Hong Kong working in alliance with human rights organizations and crime syndicates always willing to smuggle human cargo for profit. **********At the end of the pipeline was always Her Majesty's colonial government working in unspoken complicity with gangsters and spies to provide an escape for those who might otherwise be imprisoned if they remained in China. **********The successes were often spectacular. They frequently bedeviled China's powerful Ministry of State Security, whose hapless agents could never plug all the routes out of the country. **********But there were also betrayals and failures, the most notable of which compromised the escape of two longtime democracy advocates, Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao, in October 1989. Both were captured and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Mr. Wang was allowed to go into exile in the United States in 1995 after the personal intervention of President Clinton and more than 50 senators. Mr. Chen has been living under house arrest in Beijing since receiving a medical parole last fall. **********Some of the most famous student leaders of the Tiananmen movement, like Chai Ling, Li Lu and Wuer Kaixi, escaped through Hong Kong or Macao. But the Yellowbird networks have also assisted scores of other dissidents, labor activists and even Chinese Government officials seeking to defect. **********One of the most recent refugees to pass through the pipeline was Wang Xizhe, a longtime pro-democracy campaigner who fled China last fall after he wrote a public letter criticizing President Jiang Zemin and demanding that the Government enforce freedoms enshrined in the 1982 Constitution. On Oct. 8, he was at his parents' home in Guangzhou in the middle of shaving his invalid father's mustache when his beeper went off and he got word that the co-author of the protest letter, Liu Xiaobo, had been arrested in Beijing. **********''I finished shaving my father's mustache, and then I left,'' Mr. Wang recounted in an interview. ''I told my mother I had something to do.'' He never got word to his wife, whom he left behind. **********''I went to Hong Kong on a smuggler's boat,'' he said by telephone from New York, where he is studying English. ''It was so sad to watch the Chinese coastline disappear.'' **********Once he landed in Hong Kong, British officials quietly issued him travel papers, and the Clinton Administration just as quietly arranged passage for him to the United States. **********Virtually every Western consulate in the territory has confronted the  problem of accepting political refugees from China at the risk of offending Beijing's hypersensitive Communist leaders, who do not like to admit that they imprison their citizens for their political or religious views, or that a significant percentage of Chinese, if given the choice, would emigrate to the West. **********''On the record, it's not something we talk about,'' said Richard Boucher, the United States Consul General here. Over the last year, the British colonial government has stepped up its efforts to clear the final accounts of the 100 or so dissidents who had fled to Hong Kong but had not yet received offers of permanent asylum in other countries. Some countries, fearful of offending Beijing, refused to accept them. France, the United States, Canada and Britain took the bulk. By February, there were 40 left, and in late May more than 20 departed at once. **********A determined remnant of pro-democracy campaigners are left behind. They have vowed to keep helping political refugees escape the mainland, even though the risks will be much greater. **********''Those people have no intention of leaving, and we are very much worried about them,'' said a ranking diplomat, who has worked with a variety of governments to smooth the passage of political refugees out of China. **********Others who are left behind are about 10 mainland dissidents who arrived in Hong Kong and were offered asylum in Western countries, but not the ones of their choice. Last week they called on the international community to come to their rescue. **********Finally, there is always Han Dongfang, the fiery labor activist of the Tiananmen era whom China refuses to allow to come home, but who will achieve his goal on July 1 when Hong Kong will again be part of China. **********In essence, Hong Kong is a colony of refugees from China. The first big wave came in the early 1950's to escape the brutal land reforms imposed by the Communists; the next came during the Great Leap Forward, whose ill-conceived economic schemes touched off a devastating famine. In the 1960's, the chaos and persecution of the Cultural Revolution flushed thousands more across the border. **********''If you look at history, Hong Kong has been a home for people one way or another disaffected from China,'' said John Kamm, an American who has done business in the colony for more than 20 years. ''People have fled political and religious persecution and people have fled famine, and now Hong Kong is being embraced by the very people who caused these refugees to flee.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/13/world/in-congo-many-chafe-under-rule-of-kabila.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1997-07-13", "snippet": "Overall strategy of ratcheted confrontation with new Government of Laurent Kabila could lead to armed resistance in Congo, formerly Zaire; Joseph Olenghakoy, one of Congo's most outspoken politicians, says his country will not accept dictatorial r...", "word_count": 758, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Congo, Many Chafe Under Rule Of Kabila", "print_headline": "In Congo, Many Chafe Under Rule Of Kabila", "body_text": " **********Responding to a ban on opposition party politics that was announced along with the creation of this country's new Government in May, one of Congo's most outspoken opposition politicians decided he should move his office. **********But the opposition figure, Joseph Olenghakoy, did not go underground or even adopt a more discreet stance to avoid confrontation with the new Government of Laurent Kabila. Instead, Mr. Olenghakoy, the leader of the Renovating Forces for Union and Solidarity, ordered that his desk be taken out of the quiet back office in his party headquarters and defiantly placed square in the middle of the reception area, where he now sits daily to greet a stream of party members and well-wishers. **********With former Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, the main opposition figure, having been arrested in June and held overnight for making public speeches in defiance of the political ban, Mr. Olenghakoy sees the placement of his desk in full public view as a small symbolic gesture. It is part of an overall strategy of ratcheted confrontation that he and others in Congo, formerly Zaire, are already warning could ultimately lead to armed resistance. **********''Unfortunately, one of the lessons the Congolese people have learned from Kabila's rise to power is that the international community respects violent men,'' said Mr. Olenghakoy, 34. **********Mr. Kabila's forces won power in May from Mobutu Sese Seko, who nearly drove the country into the ground in almost 32 years of dictatorial rule. **********''This country didn't struggle for seven years to get rid of Mobutu to sit back and watch him be replaced by someone who uses the same methods,'' Mr. Olenghakoy added. ''But after having applauded Kabila's army's march across Zaire, the West should not expect us to accept nonviolent opposition indefinitely.'' **********In much of Africa, opposition parties face a choice between peaceful tactics, which have often proven futile in the face of repressive governments, and armed resistance. **********In the new Congo, the choice is even starker. Since sweeping to power on May 17, Mr. Kabila has in effect outlawed organized opposition, saying that his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo will rule alone until it organizes national elections -- promised for 1999. **********Complicating matters further, Mr. Kabila's edicts have received only muted criticism from the West, which seems relieved over the end of Mr. Mobutu's long dictatorship, and eager to give the new leader the benefit of the doubt. **********''We haven't tackled that specifically,'' said one Western diplomat, who was asked if protests had been lodged over the ban on political activity here. ''We do attach a lot of importance to the timetable for elections and will try our best to hold them to that.'' **********Mr. Kabila's Government has given almost no public explanations for many of its policies. But opposition leaders say that they have been told  the new leaders feel they should be allowed to work unhindered at getting this country in order again. **********There are growing signs already, however, especially here, that the new restrictions on political freedoms are grating on people's nerves. **********The brief arrest of Mr. Tshisekedi, for example, provoked incidents in several neighborhoods of the city, where opposition activists set fire to cars and trucks and played cat-and-mouse games, taunting the Government soldiers sent into the streets to restore order. **********Responding to protests in the streets carries risks for the Government. Much of Mr. Kabila's army is composed of foreign forces on loan from neighboring countries -- Rwanda, Uganda, Angola and Eritrea -- that supported his revolt. Every appearance of troops in the streets draws people out of their homes to watch and comment, mostly negatively, about what is widely resented here as a foreign occupation. **********Polls indicate that Mr. Kabila has already paid a heavy price for this perception. In one opinion survey by an independent polling agency in June, only 14 percent of those who responded said they admired the new President, while a majority said they regarded him as a ''hostage'' to foreigners. Over 75 percent said they disapproved of the ban on political activity, while 62 percent said they supported Mr. Tshisekedi. **********''There has been a large erosion already in support for this Government, and it seems clear there will be no honeymoon,'' said Olivier Kamitatu, the director of the leading polling agency here, Berci. ''Without a base, and without an army of his own, everything is in place for Kabila to fail. If he doesn't deal with the perception about the Rwandans and arrive at an understanding with the opposition, there is every reason to believe that we will be heading into a new crisis.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/world/australian-fishermen-warned-of-peril-remain-on-the-rocks.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1997-02-16", "snippet": "Fishing from rocks and cliffs along coast of New South Wales, Australia, remains hazardous pastime, and is perhaps most deadly sport in world; officials say some casualties seem to forget most basic elements of common sense and misjudge tides and ...", "word_count": 617, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Australian Fishermen, Warned of Peril, Remain on the Rocks", "print_headline": "Australian Fishermen, Warned of Peril, Remain on the Rocks", "body_text": " **********They have their buckets, lunch packs and bait bags of worms, prawns or bits of mackerel, eel and squid.

''The worst thing in the world is to stand above with relatives and have a body in the ocean that you can't find,'' he said. **********Compounding rescue difficulties is the urge of fishermen to fish from the most isolated and inaccessible spots. Several days ago, Mr. Williams recalled, a man let himself down on a ledge along a cliff and was unable to get back up. **********From the land he could not be seen, and his cries for help could not be heard. Mr. Williams happened to be passing by in his launch and spotted him. He navigated the launch toward the rocks and had the man jump into the water and swim hard away from the rocks and toward the boat for a successful rescue. **********Police officers and water safety instructors now urge those who fish from the rocks to wear life jackets and shoes with rock-gripping cleats. **********Tom Foulati, 59, a forklift truck driver, was wearing sandals and shorts as he scrambled with his pole and bag of bait over rocks above Cougee beach in south Sydney. **********''I've been fishing for years and know exactly what I'm doing,'' he said. ''I go any place and wear what I want.'' **********The police fence off dangerous places and post warning signs. But as Mr. Abbott, the senior constable, put it, ''There's no way you can put a railing along the whole New South Wales coast, and people would jump over it anyway.'' **********Some local councils are installing emergency telephones so rescue services can be called immediately in case of accidents. **********One of last year's casualties, Soo Hwan Hwang, 33, was the victim of a rogue wave. Another fisherman saw him casting from the rocks at the Royal National Park near Sydney. Ten days later his body was found. **********His widow, Sun Hee Hwang, said in an interview that her husband, a journalist who had reported on Australia for a South Korean weekly, had not known how to swim. She had warned him many times against fishing from the rocks. **********''If I'd known where he was headed,'' she said, ''I would never have let him go.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/21/business/worldbusiness/IHT-germanys-tax-plan-seems-to-target-everyone.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "1997-01-21", "snippet": "Just about everyone in the country stands to lose from the comprehensive revision of Germany's bewildering and burdensome tax system being finished this week by a government commission..By eliminating an array of write-offs, subsidies and breaks t...", "word_count": 4025, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Germany's Tax Plan Seems to Target Everyone", "print_headline": "Germany's Tax Plan Seems to Target Everyone", "body_text": " **********Just about everyone in the country stands to lose from the comprehensive revision of Germany's bewildering and burdensome tax system being finished this week by a government commission. **********By eliminating an array of write-offs, subsidies and breaks to try to offset lower tax rates, analysts say the plan will offer nearly as much pain as gain, although details will not come out until the panel led by Finance Minister Theo Waigel finishes its work Wednesday. **********The governing coalition is selling the tax plan as a way to reduce unemployment, create jobs and save Germany's taxpayers tens of billions of Deutsche marks. Mr. Waigel has warned that there can be \"no taboos\" when it comes to eliminating tax breaks. **********\"There will be tough discussions and hard decisions,\" he said. **********There also will be political trench warfare, as the proposals will unleash armies of lobbyists intent on defending tax advantages, raising the prospect that many proposed changes will be weakened. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is expected to use the new tax plan as the centerpiece of his 1998 re-election campaign, needs the legislation to be finished this year and to take effect in January 1999. **********\"It will be extremely difficult to close the loopholes,\" said Gernot Nerb, senior economist for Salomon Brothers Inc. in Frankfurt. **********Mr. Waigel came under pressure for watering down details of the plan even before it had been completed. Leaders of the top party in the governing coalition, fearing that Mr. Waigel would not deliver meaningful tax relief for the hard-earned marks of their constituents, called over the weekend for his resignation. **********\"Our chief task must be to fight unemployment,\" said Christian Wulff, the Christian Democratic leader in Lower Saxony who has led the call for Mr. Waigel to leave, \"and for that we need tax cuts so that our European competitors do not steal business from us.\" **********Grumbling about taxes has been a national pastime since unification in 1990 pulled rates painfully higher. The top bracket stands at 53 percent of gross salary for anyone earning more than 120,000 Deutsche marks ($74,830) a year. The top rate in Britain is 40 percent, and in the United States it is 33 percent. **********Mr. Waigel's panel aims to reduce the top rate to 39 percent. At the bottom end of the scale, the government aims to move the lowest bracket to no more than 20 percent from its current 25.9 percent. **********But, like the debate on monetary union, tax revision runs the risk of focusing on the disadvantages while overshadowing a raft of economic benefits, said Gerhard Grebe, an economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt. **********Prospects for consensus are not promising. The government began the year bickering over the unpopular \"solidarity\" surcharge, a 7.5 percent levy on income tax intended to pay for the reconstruction of Eastern Germany. **********The Free Democrats, the junior coalition partners, insist that the surcharge be eliminated by 2000 and have threatened to topple the government to get their way. The Christian Democrats insist the surcharge be kept into the next century and are standing firm. **********Prime ministers of East German states, which have the most to lose from scrapping the solidarity tax, are pushing to keep it for 10 to 15 years. Most now expect it to linger until 2004 or 2005. In any event, the realization is dawning that the 16 authorities on Mr. Waigel's commission are powerless to take action on the surcharge, the most disliked tax of all. **********Opposition already is out in the open on proposals to raise taxes on government retirement checks for pensioners with additional sources of income. **********If the government tries to close tax breaks on unemployment checks, unions are expected to resist. Unions will act against higher taxes on overtime wages for Sunday and night work, if proposed, bankers can be expected to try to fend off any tax on gains from stock-market profits, and insurers will fight to defend tax breaks on life-insurance policies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/03/business/worldbusiness/IHT-wall-street-applauds-as-policymakers-find-no.html": {"writer_name": "Mitchell Martin", "pub_date": "1997-07-03", "snippet": "U.S. central bankers decided to leave interest rates unchanged at their two-day policy meeting that ended Wednesday, after the economy showed few signs of inflation despite strong growth in recent months..

But although the economy grew at a strong 5.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter of the year, there have been few signs of inflation. **********It is widely believed that economic growth slowed to a rate of about 2 percent in the second quarter, but with unemployment below 5 percent for the first time in two decades, there have been questions as to whether a lack of workers would require wage increases that would kindle significant inflation. **********Stock and bond prices rose after the Fed meeting ended. The Dow Jones industrial average finished just shy of a record, up 73.05 points, at 7,795.38. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.00 points, to a record 904.03. The Nasdaq composite index, which largely reflects technology stocks, also set a record, rising 17.38 points, to 1,455.63. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to 6.71 percent from 6.74 percent on Tuesday. **********In recent weeks, the view on Wall Street has been that although the Fed might raise rates later this year, it was unlikely to do so at this meeting. That position gained credence Tuesday when the National Association of Purchasing Management issued its June report, which showed the manufacturing sector expanding but at a reduced pace from May. The government, separately, said construction spending slowed in May. **********Further evidence of moderating growth came Wednesday, when the government said factory orders fell 0.7 percent in May from April. **********Ed Yardeni and Debbie Johnson of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Inc. said that although overall factory orders fell in May, buying of high-technology goods rose 15 percent. Mr. Yardeni is among a school of economists who say that the widespread use of computers by American industry allows the economy to grow faster than the 2.5 percent annual rate that had been perceived as the maximum that would not lead to inflation. **********These so-called New Age economists say that technological advances have made traditional methods of calculating growth and inflation unreliable. **********One economist who maintains that the economy is growing far faster than the official data show is Leonard Nakamura of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Mr. Nakamura figures that the economy grew at about a 4.5 percent annual rate from 1978 to 1995, compared with official measures of about 2.5 percent. In the past five years, he said, the rate accelerated to 5.0 percent, compared with about 2.6 percent in the government figures. **********If the official data are correct, Mr. Nakamura said, then all the gains in productivity since the late 1970s would have come from workers having more machinery and working increased hours. That means that none of the recorded productivity gains came from technological advances, a situation that seems absurd to anybody who remembers living in a world without fax machines. **********Mr. Nakamura said 1978 was a watershed year. He found that the traditional measures became ineffective because of changes that became apparent around that time. Among these, he said, were the beginning of deregulation and changes in retailing that led to mismeasurements of consumer prices. **********An example of both these effects, he said, was in commercial airline fares. Before the aviation industry was deregulated, most routes had only one round-trip coach fare and most travelers paid it. Since then, he said, the full coach fare has risen at an annual rate of about 9 percent, but discount fares have risen at only about a 2 percent rate. The consumer price index tracks only the full fares, but Mr. Nakamura said that now only about 7 percent of miles flown are at the full rates, so the cost of an average flight is far lower than the inflation data suggest. **********Other changes that began to occur in the late 1970s, he said, were that personal computers \"began entering the business community in substantial numbers\" along with price scanners in retail stores and the subsequent use of electronic pricing information by retailers. This allowed for a wide variety of prices to be charged, but government price reporters were not equipped to react to the changed environment. **********Mr. Nakamura said his data on stocks were not precise, but technological advances were providing added benefits to the value of corporations beyond the increased sales and profits generated by strong economic growth. Computers, for example, make mundane corporate assets such as archived documents more valuable, he said. **********Another benefit of computers, Mr. Nakamura said, is that as their ease of use rises and they appear on more desktops, workers whose work had been relatively low level are able to accomplish more complex tasks. **********This technological enhancement of corporate assets is one reason U.S. stock prices have scored double-digit percentage advances for each of the last three years, he said, far outpacing even his torrid estimate of economic growth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/14/business/retail-sales-down-0.3-last-month.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-05-14", "snippet": "Commerce Department estimates shoppers spent three-tenths of 1 percent less in April than in March; says retail sales--unadjusted for inflation--were 4.9 percent higher than in April 1996, reaching estimated $212.2 billion; graph (L)", "word_count": 823, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Retail Sales Down 0.3% Last Month", "print_headline": "Retail Sales Down 0.3% Last Month", "body_text": " **********The nation's consumers, after spending at a surprisingly strong pace during the first months of the year, have sharply cut back on shopping, with April posting the first monthly decline in retail sales since the start of the Christmas holiday season. **********The Commerce Department estimated today that shoppers spent three-tenths of 1 percent less last month than in March as automotive sales and nearly all other major categories weakened. Moreover, a small March rise vanished through revision. **********The latest sales figures, which were expected to provide a clue to whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again next Tuesday, were widely seen as confirming that the economy had begun to decelerate from first-quarter growth that was the fastest so far of the 1990's -- a 5.6 percent annual pace. **********But in light of several distorting factors this year -- unusual winter weather, income tax season, an early Easter and New York's moratorium on sales taxes -- analysts said they could not clearly distinguish between a new, sustainable trend in retail sales and what might turn out to be simply a breather followed by renewed strong growth. And that left many of them saying that the Fed was still likely to raise interest rates, probably next week but certainly within the next few months, unless clearer signs of a slowdown emerge. **********''You can't tell how much is seasonal impact and how much is a genuinely slower pace of demand,'' said Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Tucker Anthony in New York. **********Howard Keen Jr., an economist for Conrail, was similarly skeptical. ''It's quite premature to be calling this any kind of a significant downshifting,'' he said. **********Although various other data, including two gauges of inflation, are to be published before the Fed's policy meeting on Tuesday, today's tally of retail sales is probably the last critical figure the Fed will have before the meeting. Retail sales not only account for one-third of economic activity but are one of the most up-to-date indicators available to monetary officials. **********Today's soft sales results were in line with expectations and prompted no clear reaction on Wall Street. Interest rates initially edged lower, helping power the Dow Jones industrial average above 7,300 for the first time, but after a report from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank indicated that manufacturing activity in the South had picked up speed, both markets reversed course and ended with losses. **********While analysts generally regarded the sales report as one straw in the wind against Fed action, the dominant view seemed to be that the Fed would probably still raise rates, given an unemployment rate below 5 percent and industry running at a robust pace that is using more than 84 percent of capacity. **********''It gives them a little more opportunity not to tighten next week but it would take a lot more weakness than we've seen so far to forestall it,'' said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. **********Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, warned last week of a need for higher rates unless the economy slowed, but it was unclear whether he was expecting immediate confirmation of a slowdown or was prepared to wait for more solid evidence of the longer-term trend. **********William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, dismissed the notion that today's figures represented a significant slowdown in consumer spending. Rather, he contended that the weak sales were merely the ''flip side'' of early-year strength that owed much to such temporary factors as mild shopping weather and income tax refunds that were bigger than in the past and were received earlier than usual. **********Still, Mr. Dudley added, ''this does give Chairman Greenspan one more arrow in his quiver to argue for waiting'' when the Fed deliberates next week. **********James McCormick, an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust, expressed a common view when he said the Fed faced ''a close call'' but one that ''slightly favors'' a quarter-point rate increase. **********''Supports for consumer spending are still in place,'' he noted, ''including a strong labor market, rising real incomes and increased wealth from financial markets.'' **********The decline in April retail sales, which was the first since November and the biggest since June, included a drop of five-tenths of 1 percent for durable goods. That mainly resulted from automotive sales, which fell nine-tenths of 1 percent. Merchants selling furniture and other home equipment reported receipts were three-tenths of 1 percent below the previous month, while sales were unchanged for those selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes. **********Among nondurables, the biggest drop was a fall of nine-tenths of 1 percent at department stores and other general merchandisers. Other declines were six-tenths of 1 percent in apparel; five-tenths of 1 percent in food, and one-tenth of 1 percent for gasoline stations (where prices fell) and for drugstores. **********The only sales increase -- five-tenths of 1 percent -- was at restaurants and bars. **********In all, retail sales -- unadjusted for inflation -- were 4.9 percent higher than in April 1996, reaching an estimated $212.2 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/30/world/israel-and-palestinians-to-meet-next-week-in-new-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Myers", "pub_date": "1997-09-30", "snippet": "Israel and Palestinians will resume new peace talks on October 6; announcement follows meeting with US Sec of State Madeleine K Albright in New York (M)", "word_count": 457, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel and Palestinians to Meet Next Week in New Talks", "print_headline": "Israel and Palestinians to Meet Next Week in New Talks", "body_text": " **********After meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K.

He dazzled financiers and political leaders at Davos. **********The United Nations' new Secretary General impresses nearly everyone he meets as ever so nice, but now they are discovering that he is also ever so cautious. And although  Washington and other capitals are reluctant to pass judgment so early on the man the Clinton Administration promoted as the organization's savior, some of his first moves -- or lack thereof -- have disappointed. **********By Mr. Annan's own admission, the job he assumed last month makes him ''the man in the middle,'' the chief administrative officer -- with very limited authority -- over only part of an unwieldy, decentralized, global system that takes orders from the 185 countries of the world that make up its membership. **********''I'm trying to move the organization to go through with reform at a time when lots of people think that the United States is imposing reform and that the member states are not ready,'' he said in an interview on Friday in his office overlooking the East River. ''You can come with the best blueprint, but if you impose reform, you're never going to go anywhere.'' **********Asked whether he had an impossible job before him, he replied, ''A friend of mine described it as a job from hell.'' **********A career international civil servant from Ghana who is said to have never raised his voice with colleagues, Mr. Annan, 58, whose name is pronounced to rhyme with cannon, has survived and thrived in the labyrinthian United Nations bureaucracy for more than three decades because he prefers quiet, slow-moving consensus-building to dramatic, bold action. **********But it is precisely that quality that may make it hard for him to press the United Nations to change -- the only way the United States will pay more than $1 billion in back dues. **********In its 1998 budget proposal released on Thursday, the Administration proposed spending $100 million next year and $912 million in 1999 to pay its debt. However, the payments are contingent on a level of reform that the Administration and the Congress have yet to define. **********''It's not ideal, but given the history and circumstances it's probably the best we could get,'' Mr. Annan said, acknowledging that he has no choice but to accept the proposal even though the payments are not at all certain and even though the United Nations says the United States owes $300 million more. **********Mr. Annan disagrees that his studied, low-key style is a liability. ''There seems to be a sense out there that unless you are confrontational and get into contentious situations you are not tough, you are not a leader, you are not free,'' he said. ''I've never shared that view in my life and I'm not going to change now. I often tell my colleagues you can even win without fighting so why do I have to go and pick unnecessary fights.'' **********Much to the dismay of the United States and some of the other big donors, Mr. Annan has announced that he will not have a comprehensive reform plan ready until late July at the earliest, after the entire United Nations membership has had an opportunity to weigh in. **********''A good leader must also be a good follower,'' he said of his decision to wait until all the other countries have their say. **********But the delay misses the opportunity to capitalize on the extraordinary goodwill surrounding Mr. Annan in succeeding Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Egyptian whose ouster was spearheaded by the United States. **********It also gives conservative Republicans in Congress time to preempt Mr. Annan with their own legislation. **********''I was a little surprised,'' said Princeton Lyman, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations, of Mr. Annan's decision to take so much time. ''There are a number of steps we have all been waiting for, and frankly, we hope he takes them before July.'' **********One change the United States and the world's six other largest industrial countries say they want is the merging of the United Nations' three economic departments under a single head, a proposal they formally presented last year. **********Even the departments' titles suggest duplication: the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development, the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis, and the Department for Development Support and Management Services. **********But when Edward W. Gnehm Jr., the acting chief American representative, and Ambassador Alain Dejamet of France met with Mr. Annan on Tuesday to press him for a decision on behalf of the group, he said he was not ready to make a decision, according to diplomats familiar with the meeting. **********In fact, they said, he changed the subject. And when the two envoys tried again, Mr. Annan refused to be pinned down. **********''This is an idea that has been around for a long time,'' said one diplomat. ''Even the Chinese seem to be in favor. It's all, well, a bit disappointing.'' **********Mr. Annan's reappointment of most of the senior bureaucracy at the United Nations -- many on contracts of three to five years -- instead of cleaning house has also dismayed the United States, some of the other members and even some officials inside the bureaucracy. He has even given plum assignments to several senior officials who openly lobbied against him for Mr. Boutros-Ghali. **********''Uninspired,'' is how one senior Administration official described the appointments. **********To that charge, Mr. Annan replied that the right time to make personnel changes is not in the midst of a far-reaching reform process. ''Change is a process; it's not an event,'' he said. **********Still, the way Mr. Annan has decided to organize his reform team is already causing confusion about who will do what. **********Mr. Annan appointed Maurice Strong, a former businessman from Canada who has undertaken a number of United Nations missions, to a newly created post of ''executive coordinator for reform'' at a symbolic salary of $1 a year. But Mr. Strong reports directly to Mr. Annan, not to Joseph E. Connor, the American Under Secretary General in charge of the United Nations' administration and management. **********The two men are said to have a correct relationship at best. **********The Administration has expressed concern that Mr. Strong may usurp or duplicate some of the functions now performed by Mr. Connor, a former chairman and chief executive of Price Waterhouse, whom the Administration hand-picked to lead the reform effort three years ago. **********In addition, Mr. Strong openly campaigned for a second term for Mr. Boutros-Ghali, predicting that efforts by Madeleine K. Albright, then the chief American representative, to oust him would fail. **********When Ms. Albright met with Mr. Annan before she left for Washington as Secretary of State, she had a two-word reaction to Mr. Strong's appointment, according to American officials: ''Why Strong?'' **********Mr. Annan explained that Mr. Connor would continue to deal with making the United Nations more efficient, but that he needed Mr. Strong to reach out to the countries that belong to the United Nations and craft a plan reflecting their larger vision for change. **********''Reform is a full-time activity,'' Mr. Annan said in defending Mr. Strong's appointment. ''It is not something I can tag on to Mr. Connor's functions.'' **********Meanwhile, there is still a third reform apparatus: a handful of committees made up of all the countries in the United Nations, headed by Ismael Rezali of Malaysia, the president of the General Assembly, many with their own specific ideas of what does and does not need to be changed. **********As part of his conciliatory style and his determination to reach out to the United States Congress, Mr. Annan has invited a team from the staffs of several lawmakers, including that of Senator Jesse Helms,  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an outspoken critic of the United Nations, to discuss reform at the organization next week. **********Mark Thiessen, Mr. Helms's spokesman, said the purpose of the meeting is to give Mr. Annan ''some input'' into the specific targets for the United Nations that Mr. Helms will include in legislation he intends to introduce before any taxpayers' money is spent on back dues. **********Mr. Annan said he is ''uncomfortable'' with specific targets dictated by Washington, but his gesture to consult closely with Congress at all has sparked criticism from other delegations that he is America's man at the United Nations. **********''I am a free man,'' he insisted. **********He is a realist as well. **********''Without Congress the payment cannot be made,'' he said. ''To those who say, 'Aren't you setting a bad example and are you going to do the same for all the other 184 Parliaments in the world?' my answer is, 'I will devote the same attention to any country that pays 25 percent of the dues and owes $1.3 billion.'

That made her angry enough. But when she heard that managers had told other employees that she was let go for being a problem employee, she wanted to sue. **********''It was not true,'' she said, calling the second accusation insult to injury. But the company said she had no right to sue. In her employee handbook was a requirement that she agree to arbitrate disputes related to her job. The committee that was to resolve any complaint in arbitration would include two hotel managers and two hotel employees picked by the executives who had dismissed her. Moreover, the company's personnel department would determine who could testify on her behalf. If the committee deadlocked, one of the executives who had dismissed her would break the tie. **********But Ms. Cheng-Canindin may have her day in court after all. The California Court of Appeals ruled recently that the hotel's arbitration process was so unfair that it was not binding and that she could sue. A hotel spokesman referred queries on the issue to a lawyer, who said he could not comment while the case was pending. **********The court decision, and others like it, may prove important to an ever-increasing number of American workers who have been required to sign arbitration agreements to win or keep their jobs. Within the last year or so, these agreements appear to have raised more and more questions about fairness, bringing something of a backlash that might well result in curbs. **********Arbitration is a dispute resolution process involving a hearing outside of court. The  arbitrators, who are supposed to be neutral, hear a complaint and determine a resolution, which is final and binding. **********''About a year ago we knew of a couple of dozen companies with mandatory arbitration,'' said Richard Naimark, corporate senior vice president of the American Arbitration Association, a trade group for the arbitrators who hear these cases. ''Now we know of 300.'' The association says it confers with 12 to 15 companies a month that are beginning to use arbitration. **********Arbitration agreements rose in popularity after Congress acted in 1991 to reinforce protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII, which allowed employees to sue and collect punitive damages, was aimed primarily at discrimination because of an individual's race, age, sex, religion or national origin. But employers say that employees have used Title VII too broadly, leading to more and more lawsuits and making it difficult for companies to dismiss employees without legal repercussions. ''Anyone can say, 'I am in a protected group,' '' said John W. Robinson 4th, a labor lawyer in Tampa, Fla., who often represents employers. ''A white male can claim reverse discrimination -- not that it is an easy case to make.'' **********Arbitration was seen as a low-cost way to settle disputes. Businesses said they needed to make arbitration mandatory because employees tended to choose jury trials despite the cost to both parties. ''It can commonly take two years to get to trial, and that is very expensive,'' Mr. Robinson said. ''Your bill can easily reach $100,000.'' **********The Supreme Court has upheld the legality of brokerage houses' requirements that new employees agree to have all claims heard by arbitration panels. Yet more and more courts are saying that workers cannot sign away their rights to sue in areas of discrimination. These new decisions may send the issue back to the Supreme Court. **********The National Association of Security Dealers is reconsidering its requirement that industry employees like stockbrokers and traders agree to mandatory arbitration in harassment and discrimination cases. And proposals in Congress that would outlaw mandatory arbitration are gaining momentum. ''We have 42 co-signers,'' said a spokeswoman for Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who sponsored one version of the bill, which previously had no more than 10 co-signers. A similar bill sponsored by Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat from Wisconsin, has three co-signers; in previous sessions of Congress, it had none. **********Arbitrators are neither licensed nor regulated. Although trade groups try to impose standards, no particular training is required and companies can choose anyone for the job. Arbitrators are often selected from the ranks of trade associations or companies that have arbitrators for hire. In recent months, the two biggest arbitration associations -- the American Arbitration Association and the National Academy of Arbitrators -- and the biggest dispute-resolution company have said they do not want their members to hear cases in which the odds are stacked. **********''Many employers have adopted arbitration plans,'' said George Nicolau, recent past president of the National Academy of Arbitrators. ''Many are mandatory, and many are quite unfair.'' **********John P. Unroe, president of the nation's biggest dispute-resolution company, Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services/ EnDispute, based in Irvine, Calif., agreed. ''If an arbitration isn't fair,'' he said, ''not only does the case suffer, the arbitration movement suffers.'' **********The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission enforces Title VII but recently issued a policy statement opposing mandatory arbitration. ''Our view is that 'mandatory' is the problem,'' said Ellen J. Vargyas, a lawyer for the commission. ''We support voluntary forms of dispute resolution, including arbitration.'' **********Judges generally like arbitration because it helps keep dockets clear, although some  think it emphasizes speed over justice. ''Judges come to feel that the expeditious disposition of a case is more important than the quality of the adjudications,'' said Anthony J. Kline, presiding justice of the California Court of Appeals. **********Most experts view fair arbitration as an excellent way to settle disputes. But its effectiveness wanes when employers set rules that obviously favor them. And no matter how lopsided the rules, most people are forced to arbitrate. The main reason is the 1991 Supreme Court decision upholding the brokerage houses' requirement, Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corporation. Before this ruling, Title VII stipulations had been interpreted to mean that a person could not waive the right to sue. **********CONSIDER the case of Michele Peacock, who tried to sue the Great Western Mortgage Corporation for sexual harassment, contending, among other things, that at a trade show in Atlantic City an executive had suggested they share a bed so he could ''get to know you better.'' But because of an arbitration requirement in the employee handbook, she could not sue. Under the rules of the company, she could not seek damages or fees, and she was not allowed to see evidence that might support her case before the hearing, although the company could. **********''In Gilmer, a very large corporation asked a very little person to sign away rights,'' said Neil M. Mullin, who represents Ms. Peacock and plans to file next month to argue the case before the Supreme Court. ''The disparity of bargaining power did not impress the court. The rule became: 'You signed it. Live with it.' '' **********A spokesman for Great Western, Tim McGarry, echoed that interpretation of the rule. ''The key question is if Ms. Peacock should be required to live by a commitment she made,'' he said. ''So far, the courts have said she should.'' **********While one problem with arbitration can be the companies that make it mandatory, another can be with people who work as arbitrators. Even though members of the big arbitration groups will not hear cases they regard as obviously unfair, others apparently have no such qualms. **********''There are still lots of people out there who will,'' said Mr. Unroe of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services/EnDispute.

Thousands.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/25/world/wartime-envoy-on-nazi-gold-bristles-at-hindsight.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1997-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1088, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wartime Envoy on Nazi Gold Bristles at Hindsight", "print_headline": "Wartime Envoy on Nazi Gold Bristles at Hindsight", "body_text": " **********Seymour J. Rubin, an enduring lawyer who arrived in this city as a Roosevelt-era Wunderkind, gently sipped his martini, deciding how to defend his reputation in a controversy rooted 50 years deep in history. **********''I've been here in Washington since 1939 and seen people come and go, seen people being praised, seen them being condemned,'' the 83-year-old international trade specialist said. He was thinking back to 1946 when he was the Truman Administration's deputy negotiator of what has suddenly become a much criticized accord with Switzerland over the disposition of the gold of Nazi Germany's war machine. **********''There was never any great controversy at all,'' Mr. Rubin said of that treaty's enactment. A new Government study accuses Switzerland of grossly violating the accord and accuses the Truman Administration of having engineered ''a bad bargain'' that covered only a minor amount of the total plunder. **********On a luncheon break from his judicial duties with the Inter-American Development Bank's administrative tribunal, Mr. Rubin noted that in Washington now as ever there was nothing like hindsight. But as a capital survivor who swims daily to keep in trim, he hardly seemed haunted by history as he chose words somewhere between lawyerly precision and personal passion. **********''The accusation now that we pooped out in a basic blunder on the part of Mr. Truman seems to me pandering to Al D'Amato and maybe to the Jewish organizations as well,'' said Mr. Rubin. He referred to the United States Senator from New York and to Jewish leaders who first pressed the indictment -- concurred with now by the Clinton Administration -- that the Swiss Government deliberately failed to return hundreds of millions of dollars in assets that Nazi Germany had looted from European banks and Holocaust victims while the United States stood by. **********''Maybe 'pandering' is too strong a word,'' the lawyer amended in commenting on the critical report and its director, Stuart E. Eizenstat, Under Secretary of Commerce. ''Basically, I think Mr. Eizenstat took a look at what the public pressures are and then decided that one of the things he could do was to fault the U.S. delegation back in 1946.'' **********Mr. Eizenstat responded that the pandering accusation was ''an absurd proposition,'' particularly since critics like Mr. D'Amato had been focusing on the actions of the Swiss, not of the Truman Administration. **********''We had to be willing to look at our position too,'' added Mr. Eizenstat, who emphasized that the report hardly found ''moral equivalence'' between Washington's position and the larger failures of other nations. **********The searing 200-page report, involving 11 Government agencies and thousands of pages of documents, pored over the accord's history and concluded that Swiss bankers had been profiting richly from unreturned booty across decades of ''indifference to the needs of the victims of the Holocaust and their heirs.'' **********Further, the report accused the Truman Administration of a tactical blunder in unfreezing Swiss assets shortly after the war ended and thereby losing the leverage to see that the Swiss properly returned war loot. Some critics in Congress raised objections at the time that the Administration was too easily compromising its bargaining strengths, the report noted. **********Mr. Eizenstat said the findings made clear that the problem was ''not the shortcomings of Mr. Rubin himself.'' Rather, the accord's failure, he said, largely resulted from the ''obdurate posturing'' of the Swiss, the lack of Allies' support for any tougher United States stance, and the postwar shift in Administration priorities to rebuilding Germany and the rest of Europe in the ensuing cold war. **********''Mr. Rubin did the best he could under these limitations,'' Mr. Eizenstat declared, adding that the negotiator lacked the support of ''senior-level people in the Administration'' in seeking a stronger deal. **********As he looks back, Mr. Rubin finds insult mixed with injury, for not only is his mission criticized in hindsight but he has also lately discovered he was the target of private anti-Semitic slurs by a Swiss negotiator. He shrugged at this, emphasizing that his main regret is not the treaty but the trust placed in the Swiss to live up to it. **********''I probably would have done a hell of a lot more to try and make sure that the Swiss carried the thing out in good faith,'' he said, had he known then what he knows now. The Swiss, he noted, eventually rebuffed the heirs of victims by requiring Holocaust death certificates and other elaborate documentation to stake claims on bank holdings. ''We were probably naive on that,''he said. **********But Mr. Rubin firmly rejected the suggestion that the Truman Administration could have applied more pressure for a better deal. He said the possibility of keeping Swiss assets frozen after the war was rendered moot when Britain, eager to move on to recovery, decided to end the wartime blacklist of Swiss companies even before the accord was signed. **********''I never blamed them for that,'' said Mr. Rubin. ''A lot of people in the United States were saying the same thing: the war is over and if we continue blacklisting Swiss companies, we can't do business with them but everybody else in the world will.'' **********The Eizenstat report concluded that President Truman had settled for token reparations for the victims of Nazism because of contrary pressures to focus on the emerging Soviet threat. Mr. Rubin angrily rejects this notion. **********''This leads to a suggestion that poor Mr. Truman, of all the people in the world, was a weakling!'' he said. He conceded there had been a debate within the Truman Administration about applying pressure on the Swiss and ''the Treasury Department was by and large a little more vigorous.'' **********But Mr. Rubin, who worked for the State Department in negotiating the accord, said, ''Nobody ever raised cold war considerations -- with the negotiating delegation, at any rate.'' **********Mr. Rubin said that the fact that the accord had resulted in the Swiss returning more than $30 million of the booty had been overlooked in the current ''hullabaloo.'' The Eizenstat report found that amount to be a scandalously small fraction of the treasure exploited by the Swiss for half a century. **********Looking back as a veteran of a score of counseling positions across six different administrations, Mr. Rubin wished Mr. Eizenstat full speed ahead in his mission for a far better level of accounting and reparations now that fresh pressures were at work. **********The lawyer noted that in his part of history, he had also held positions outside Government representing Jewish organizations on the very same Nazi gold issue that had cycled back upon him. **********''I'm the guy who worked on this more than any person around,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/18/business/columbia-hca-to-acquire-hospital-in-west-virginia.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-04-18", "snippet": "Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp agrees to buy Beckley Hospital in Beckley, W Va, its first planned acquisition since Federal investigation of the company began last month; price undisclosed; on April 15, Columbia revised its bid for Value Health Inc ...", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COLUMBIA/HCA TO ACQUIRE HOSPITAL IN WEST VIRGINIA", "print_headline": "COLUMBIA/HCA TO ACQUIRE HOSPITAL IN WEST VIRGINIA", "body_text": " **********The Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to buy a hospital in West Virginia, its first planned acquisition since a Federal investigation of the company began last month.

McLuhan, the godfather of new media, died in 1980, outliving his first wave of cultic fame and dying a decade before his second, but the expiring old media are still paying homage. **********Wired magazine has called him its ''patron saint,'' even publishing an interview with someone in 1995 who pretended to be an incarnation of the techno-prophet ( http://www.wired.com/wired/4.01/features/channeling.html). The magazine's book publishing arm, Hardwired, has also just published two of McLuhan's graphic manifestoes: ''The Medium is the Massage'' and ''War and Peace in the Global Village,'' wrapping them in Wired's trademark neon colors. **********M.I.T. Press has also jumped in with ''On McLuhan: Forward Through the Rearview Mirror,'' a book that with its pastiche of images and quotations by and about McLuhan, screams out for multimedia presentation. One of its editors, Paul Benedetti, did in fact accomplish something like that for Voyager, whose extravagantly rich CD-ROM,  ''Understanding McLuhan,'' includes the complete texts of ''Understanding Media'' and ''The Gutenberg Galaxy,'' video clips, testimonials and search engines (http://www.voyagerco.com/catalog/mcluhan). **********And then, of course, there is the medium that has helped inspire all these reprinted textual messages: the World Wide Web is laden with sites devoted to McLuhan's quips, positions and impact. The University of Toronto, where McLuhan taught, presents its ''McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology'' (http://www.fis.utoronto.ca/mcluhan/program.htm). A media theorist has gathered essays in tribute and criticism (http://www.aber.ac.uk/dgc/influ02.html). And long papers are plentiful (see http://www.ctheory.com/a28-digital--humanism.html). **********What are we to make of all this attention to a dead prophet? Is it because of the ubiquity of McLuhan's suggestive aphorisms (''the medium is the message'') or pungent phrases (''global village,'' ''information age'')? Is it because he gave birth to what is now called media studies and predicted a crisis in print culture? Or maybe it is because of the appeal of his playful provocations (''the future of the book is the blurb'') and extreme proclamations (''political democracy as we know it today is finished''). **********Yes, but it may also be partly because, as he predicted, sound bites like his have inherited the earth. And we are living in the world he outlined 30 years ago. The more the media proliferate the more plausible McLuhan's main thesis becomes: ''Media are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, esthetic, psychological, moral, ethical and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered.'' McLuhan defined media in the broadest sense -- as extensions of the human body, expanding our ears or eyes or nervous systems, changing the ''ratios'' between our senses, and altering the way we think and experience the world. **********The first crucial media event, for McLuhan, was the creation of a phonetic alphabet -- a medium that completely altered the course of history. Written literacy, McLuhan argued, inspired Western notions of order and reason. He believed the alphabet (and movable type) transformed tribal man into modern man. The next transformation is still going on, and oddly enough, goes in just the opposite direction, back to a kind of high-tech tribal culture, in which literacy is irrelevant. The electric media, beginning with the telegraph, shifted the emphasis from the eye to the ear, from systematic order to multiple sensations. Television is the key example, which helped create a world we now call post-modern. **********There are many details to quarrel about but the cultural changes that  McLuhan outlined in the 1960's have indeed continued -- and they are precisely what is being celebrated by Web devotees who refer to new on-line communities, shifting sexual identities in cyberspace, and a world of hot-linked connections rather than sequentially ordered texts. The Web, in McLuhan's categories, might even be considered a form of hyper-television, exaggerating that medium's character. **********The ''cool'' nature of television becomes cold on the Web. There is no ''real,'' high-definition portrait of the world; the entire medium depends on the patience, imagination and involvement of the surfer. **********A Web site generally thrives if it stands out against this background, emphasizing process and not just information. Much-heralded ''cool'' sites (as they are often called) are those that are warmer, more approachable and inviting than their surroundings. They ''do'' something in response to our doing something, making the Web seem more like interactive television (the Microsoft Network has even tried to imitate TV -- so far unsuccessfully -- with its ''channels'' and programming). **********The Internet attracts so many hotheads, with their diatribes, partly because of similar attempts to stand out against the coldness of the medium; exaggerated feelings and expressions strain at breaking bounds. But rather than seeming comical or overwrought as McLuhan thought heated personalities do on television, the medium is so removed, so composed and so cold, the very heat of such extremes has a closet appeal. The hotheads can even seem representative, since they are all a Web surfer tends to remember. **********So there is much in McLuhan's way of looking at technology that is suggestive. But the flaws in McLuhanesque interpretation are also the flaws in the new media. McLuhan turned technology into the primal force of human existence. Everything is seen through a single lens; all social activity is its reflection and all culture is in its service. McLuhan once described as ''idiotic'' anybody who thought that the content of a communication was more relevant than its medium. For him, it really didn't matter what was on television or in the newspaper or on the Web. Their impact as media was far more profound than anything they contain. **********This is a strangely cold and almost nihilistic picture of the world. This message has no middle ground, no medium. Media are powerful but so are what they contain. Without content, media become a mere distraction -- sonic or optical wallpaper. With content, perceptions of the medium itself can change. Look at the impact McLuhan managed to have on new media by using antiquated movable type. And that ancient medium continues to return the compliment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/06/business/rehearing-denied-in-municipal-bond-case.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1997-06-06", "snippet": "Federal Court of Appeals in Denver, Colo, has denied Justice Department petition to rehear case that overturned conviction of Robert Cochran, former municipal-bond executive with Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Oklahoma City; decision could be serious bl...", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rehearing Denied in Municipal-Bond Case", "print_headline": "Rehearing Denied in Municipal-Bond Case", "body_text": " **********In a potentially serious blow to regulators' powers in the municipal bond market, the Federal Court of Appeals in Denver has denied a Justice Department petition to rehear a case that overturned a conviction of Robert Cochran, a former municipal-bond executive with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company in Oklahoma City. **********In a decision on Wednesday, the court denied the Government's petition to rehear the case before the full court.

Microsoft lost 87.5 cents, to $99.625, and Dell fell $3.125, to $64.75. While the Dow fell 58.92 points yesterday, or 0.85 percent, to 6,896.56 -- the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index dropped even more, down 1.5 percent. **********Part of the reason is that in recent weeks, an increasing number of investors have been pulling tens of millions of dollars out of technology funds -- those mutual funds that specialize in technology stocks. As a result, technology funds have lost hundreds of millions in value in the last month. **********''Investor sentiment is drying up,'' said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund inflows. ''This is reminiscent of last June,'' he said, recalling withdrawals that preceded July's steep decline in technology stocks, which helped drag down the larger market. ''There is an identical abatement in investor demand for technology mutual funds.'' **********Indeed, as of last Wednesday, technology funds saw their fifth consecutive week of net redemptions, according to AMG, the first time the company has recorded such a flight from technology funds. Since Feb. 6, $229 million more was taken out of technology funds than was put in. (Technology funds are now valued at close to $16 billion.) **********So while the leading technology indexes are down on the year, technology funds are much worse off. **********Last month, 10 of the largest technology funds lost, on average, about 9 percent of their value, through a combination of net outflows and declining stock prices, after big gains in January, according to Lipper Analytical Services. **********T. Rowe Price's Science and Technology Fund, one of the largest, is down about 9 percent this year, and in February it saw its value decline by nearly $400 million because of net outflows and slumping performance. **********The Seligman Communication Technology Funds, with about $3.4 billion in assets, were down nearly 7 percent in February. **********What happened? ''Well, the short answer is: reality set in,'' said Richard A. Shaffer, a principal at Technologic Partners, a New York consulting firm. ''The story of the last year or two is the Internet, and every time we find a new technology we fall in love with it. But the problem is, technology attracts momentum investors who don't always understand the business. So in many ways, it's the herd mentality.'' **********And the herd can swerve suddenly, as it has done, because momentum investors want stocks that are moving higher quickly. So when the stocks fall, the herd moves elsewhere. **********With the price-to-earnings ratio among Nasdaq stocks peaking at a record 50.3 at the end of 1996, investors also began to wonder whether technology stocks had become too expensive. ''In technology, valuations got ridiculous,'' said Roger McNamee, general partner at Integral Capital Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. ''And the same guys who were buying irrationally on the way up are now selling irrationally on the way down.'' **********Among the stocks that have been dumped are networking and communications issues -- shares of companies that help computers talk to one another, using modems, for example. After a sparkling 1996, Cisco Systems is down 21 percent this year; Ascend Communications has lost 23 percent, and the 3Com Corporation has plunged an astounding 54 percent, a loss of about $6.5 billion in its market capitalization. **********While this year's downturn has been significant, several analysts said that last summer the Nasdaq managed to lose about 16 percent over concerns about weakness in the technology sector, before the stocks and the index surged at the end of the year. **********This year, however, there is a whole new set of concerns, including fears about weakening sales overseas, partly because of a strong dollar, and the warning by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, about ''excessive optimism'' in the financial markets. **********As a result, even some of technology's longtime darlings are being jilted.

But instead of feeling as if I've attained a certain measure of insight and wisdom about social interaction, I often find myself responding as did the character originally played by Yul Brynner in ''The King and I'': ''It's a puzzlement.'' **********Under the First Amendment, we can be subjected to movies like ''Leaving Las Vegas'' and plays like ''Sex and Longing,'' both of which border close to the pornographic. And the current film ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' can cynically hold up a smut publisher to be a champion of civil liberties. **********Yet last March, Bernice Harris, then a 58-year-old cashier in the Senate coffee shop, became the focus of a sexual harassment imbroglio just because a young part-time Senate aide took offense to her calling him ''baby.'' It was a term of endearment she applied to everyone -- from janitors to senators -- whom she had encountered in the 30 years she worked at the Capitol. And last fall, a second grader in Far Rockaway, Queens, was suspended from his public school by an administrator who was going by the sexual harassment rule book because he kissed a classmate and tore a button from her skirt. Only after an outcry of public indignation was he reinstated. **********It all makes for a perplexing anomaly. **********We are living in the most openly sexual society ever. The National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago,  in a study published in 1994 titled ''The Social Organization of Sexuality,'' found that among people born after 1963, about two-thirds have lived together before marriage. On our stage and screen and television, we easily accept profanity -- no, egregious vulgarity -- with impunity. **********Yet amid this pervasive permissiveness and libertinism, we're expected to adhere to a stringent puritanical code of behavior in the workplace, where complaints and lawsuits involving sexual harassment can be brought on the most trivial grounds. **********When it comes to morals, the concept clearly varies with the Zeitgeist. In the Colonial Massachusetts of Hawthorne's ''The Scarlet Letter,'' Hester Prynne was made to wear a red ''A'' for her adultery. In Afghanistan only a few short months ago, a couple caught in adultery were stoned to death by the locals while the police looked on. In the TV land of the 1990's, as Murphy Brown found out, having a child out of wedlock puts you atop the ratings. **********What constitutes sexual harassment? Even though I am a lawyer, I've never argued a case in court. But I am confident that if Floria Tosca, the heroine of Puccini's opera, had come to me instead of taking a leap off the Castel Sant'Angelo, I could have beaten the murder rap for her. Be it New York in 1997 or Rome in 1800, Baron Scarpia was clearly out of line. Demanding sex in exchange for sparing a lover's life -- now that's sexual harassment! **********At the other end of the spectrum, a middle-aged friend who was once a low-level manager at a New Jersey company recalls the advice he received about a decade ago at a training session aimed at limiting the concern's vulnerability to sexual harassment complaints. If you're thinking of complimenting a subordinate's appearance or dress, don't! You never know how someone is going to take that sort of thing, the woman conducting the seminar warned. Over the years, I'm sure I have made comments that were greeted with a hearty chuckle then but would get me a slap in the face or a lawsuit today. **********Where does it all end? When you're a defendant in a suit of this sort, it's a no-win situation. Even if you prevail, there is damage to your reputation and potentially huge legal costs. **********IN all the discussion of sexual harassment, an important issue has been overlooked: the necessity for an unambiguous definition of the term. **********In its most significant ruling to date on sexual harassment in the workplace, the Supreme Court in November 1993 unanimously established the ''reasonable person''  standard, allowing workers to pursue and win sexual harassment cases if the workplace ''environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive.'' This is a rather vague guideline that begs the question of what is reasonable. **********We sorely need explicit laws. In struggling with the issue of pornography more than three decades ago, Justice Potter Stewart remarked, ''I can't define it, but I know it when I see it.'' When it comes to sexual harassment, we cannot afford anything as ironically amorphous."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/07/business/people.html": {"writer_name": "Tamar Charry", "pub_date": "1997-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "People", "body_text": " ***********Michael Colacchio was named to the new position of general manager at Hampel/Stefanides, San Franciso.

Gen. Selmo Cikotic, is a Bosnian Muslim who came to Washington in December 1994 as the military attache at the Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The State Department sent him this month to the Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., under a program to train and educate foreign military officers. **********The accusations against General Cikotic came from Croatian officials, according to a senior Administration official. They include unconfirmed allegations that he commanded soldiers who killed and tortured people in and around Bugojno, a town of about 40,000 people in central Bosnia, in July 1993, when Muslim and Croatian forces were fighting for the town. **********General Cikotic, 34, is a former Yugoslav Army officer who served as a field commander and as chief of staff of the Bosnia Third Corps during the war. He also served as a senior member of the Muslim delegation that held peace talks with the Croatians in 1993. **********He declined to address the accusations against him during a brief telephone interview.

The tribunal has indicted 75 suspected war criminals -- 54 Serbs, 18 Croats and 3 Muslims.

Moreover, since the planes are too small to make it all the way to Tokyo or Osaka, trucks are sometimes still needed for part of the journey, and shipping time is cut by only one day. Last year, only 10 flights took off from the airport, and taxpayers are wondering if their money was well spent. **********''It may be good for a children's playground,'' said Kayoko Omiyo, the wife of a farmer. The town government is indeed thinking of turning the runway over for in-line skating, and cross-country skiing in the winter, to make greater use of the site. **********With their nation facing a severe budget deficit, people in Japan are starting to object to the spending for public works projects that have played an outsized role in Japan's economy and political system. The questioning is part of a broader reassessment of public spending policy and of Japan's once-admired bureaucracy, both of which are now being seen as riddled with waste and corruption. **********Japan spends more on public construction, about $300 billion, than the Pentagon spends on defense. Critics call Japan ''doken kokka,'' the ''construction state,'' a reference not only to the magnitude of the activity but also to the cozy relationships between contractors and Government officials that keeps pork-barrel projects coming. Public works have also long been a sore point in trade with the United States, as American companies seeking a share of the huge projects have complained of a bidding system that locks them out of contracts. **********''The construction state is in some respects akin to the military-industrial complex in cold-war America (or the Soviet Union), sucking in the country's wealth, consuming it inefficiently, growing like a cancer and bequeathing both fiscal crisis and environmental devastation,'' Gavan McCormack, a professor of Japanese history at Australia National University, wrote in ''The Emptiness of Japanese Affluence,'' a recent book. **********In the last few years, public works spending has been stepped up even more to stimulate a languid economy. Everywhere you look, roads are being paved or dug up, rivers dammed, bays filled to make new land, and domed arenas erected. Projects range from the $7.6 billion Akashi Straits Bridge, which is being built near Kobe and which will be the longest bridge in the world, to the art museum for the small town of Ono, completed in 1993, which displays only reproductions because there was no money to buy art. **********The statistics alone are staggering. Japan uses as much cement each year as the United States, despite having only half the population and only 4 percent of the land area. Japan's construction industry, with 500,000 companies and 6.6 million workers, accounts for 10 percent of the country's employment compared with 5 to 7 percent in other advanced nations. Public works spending in Japan amounts to about 6.6 percent of gross domestic product compared with 1.6 percent in the United States and 2 to 3 percent for Western European nations, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. **********But now the Cabinet has formed a task force to cut public construction expenses. Citizens have begun to question Government extravagance in public buildings. And environmentalists have started fighting the construction binge that has left only 3 of Japan's 113 major rivers flowing freely and only 45 percent of the coastline of the four main islands in a natural state. **********The press is having a field day digging up white elephants, like the  pier at Fukui, a port to which ships rarely come, that is called a ''10 billion yen fishing hole'' by local residents. The pier, sitting empty except for fishermen, actually cost 30 billion yen, or $250 million. **********A fiscal crisis is driving Japan's reassessment. After years of lecturing the United States to reduce its Federal budget deficit, Japan has developed a deficit of its own that is far worse proportionately than Washington's. **********In 1996, Japan's central and local budget deficits amounted to 7 percent of gross domestic product, the highest among the Group of Seven major industrial countries. The figure for the United States is less than 2 percent. Some 22 percent of next year's budget will be spent on interest payments on the accumulated debt -- more than on education, science and the military combined. **********''Japan holds a time bomb that is expected to explode in a few years, and the bomb gets bigger every year,'' an advisory committee to the Ministry of Finance said in a recent report. **********The deficit results from several years of a weak economy, which forced the Government to cut taxes and to increase spending to prime the pump. Since 1992, the Government has announced stimulus packages worth $560 billion, with much of it spent on public works. The budgets included $50 billion in 1995 alone for relief and reconstruction after the Kobe earthquake. **********Despite such infusions, the economy still has not fully recovered. Some economists say the public works stimulus is losing its effectiveness, though others say it kept the economy from a deeper recession. **********Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has suggested that the Government might review a pledge to spend  more than $5 trillion on public works  from 1995 to 2004. The promise was made in response to demands by the United States that Japan stimulate domestic spending to increase imports. **********Critics also label spending for agriculture as wasteful, including $50 billion the Government committed to spend over six years to compensate farmers for the partial opening of the rice market to imports. Takigawa, a town in northern Japan, is building a hot springs resort using agricultural promotion funds, justifying it on the grounds that a shop on the premises will sell local produce. **********But cutting back on public works is proving to be difficult. Those expecting sharp cutbacks next year were outraged that the proposed budget included $10 billion for extensions of bullet train lines that analysts expect to prove uneconomical. **********Too much fiscal tightness could plunge the still-fragile economy into recession. Japan is already planning to raise taxes this year to fight the deficit and the United States is cautioning Japan not to restrict spending too much. **********But a bigger reason is that pork-barrel politics is deeply ingrained. Politicians push for big projects for their districts, not only to satisfy voters but because construction companies have long been among the biggest contributors to the Liberal Democratic Party. The party has governed Japan for most of the post-World War II period and is now back in power after a three-year hiatus.  Ministries also fight any diminution of their budgets. **********Bribery of public officials to win contracts is common. So is bid-rigging, in part because bidding on many projects is open only to designated companies, shutting out foreign firms, among others. Those factors have helped make construction costs in Japan at least 30 to 40 percent higher than in the United States. **********Government officials contend, and many citizens agree, that Japan needs to improve its infrastructure . The war leveled large parts of the country, and Japan has emphasized developing industry over improvements that would have been considered consumer amenities. **********Half of Japan's population lives in homes that are not connected to sewage systems. And Japan has only 4,000 miles of expressways compared with 5,500 in France and 7,000 in Germany. Most of its highways are only two lanes in each direction and are clogged. **********''Japan is still a developing country compared with Western Europe and the United States,'' said Yasuo Mitsuie, a Ministry of Construction official. **********But critics say that politics drives  projects to take on a life of their own, even if the need for them disappears. **********''The construction itself is the purpose,'' said Hirofumi Uzawa, a retired University of Tokyo economics professor. **********There are some signs of change. In a rare move, the Ministry of Construction has canceled plans for four dams -- of 300 being built or planned. The Ministry of Agriculture is reviewing its agricultural airport program because the four that have been completed have been failures. **********But the construction state will not die easily. Indeed, a project to top all others is now being planned -- to move the nation's capital out of Tokyo by the year 2010. **********To reduce the congestion and concentration of power in Tokyo, a new capital city of 600,000 people is to be built. The initial cost estimate is more than $100 billion, but it is likely to cost much more."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/30/world/french-jobless-seize-unemployment-offices-to-press-for-500-bonus.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1997-12-30", "snippet": "Jobless demonstrators occupy nine employment offices across France to demand year-end bonuses of $500; others block trains in Marseilles and Chatellerault; national unemployment averages 12.5 percent (M)", "word_count": 442, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Jobless Seize Unemployment Offices to Press for $500 Bonus", "print_headline": "French Jobless Seize Unemployment Offices to Press for $500 Bonus", "body_text": " **********In France, where being unemployed has become a full-time occupation for hundreds of thousands of people, jobless demonstrators occupied nine employment offices today to demand year-end bonuses of $500. **********About 200 unemployed people also blocked trains at the main station in Marseilles, where unemployment is higher than the 12.5 percent national average, and 40 demonstrators occupied tracks on the main rail line between Paris and Bordeaux at Chatellerault for brief periods today, causing delays of several hours for thousands of travelers. **********In Chatellerault, demonstrators had been thrown out of the local employment office after occupying it for several days in support of the demand for a year-end bonus.

The Government plans a 1 percent increase next July. Unemployment benefits in France decrease over time and expire, for most people, after two and a half years; the unemployment rate for the last two and a half years has hovered around 12 percent. **********Employer groups and the conservative opposition say that high taxes and employer-paid benefits required by law discourage businesses from hiring. This, they say, explains why it is so much harder for people here to find jobs than it is in the United States, where the jobless rate is about a third of what it is in France. **********The protesters chose the year-end bonus issue as a way of dramatizing the inability of all recent French governments, Socialist or conservative, to reduce unemployment significantly.

At the rambling, adobe-style buildings that are the temporary home of Dreamworks, the lawn was covered with tents under which the company's 1,200 employees were helping themselves to a lavish buffet dinner. **********Several tables were spread with items for making personalized decorations; a sled led by two live reindeer for employees to pose with, and wandering amid it all were Dreamworks' three partners -- Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and David Geffen -- dressed in their trademark jeans and sport shirts. **********The party resonated with the mood of success and stability typical of more established film companies celebrating splashy hits. But 26 months after the much-covered debut of Dreamworks SKG -- the first attempt to begin a major new entertainment company in decades -- the studio is still waiting to make its first big splash. It will not release its first live-action feature film until next fall, when ''The Peacemaker,'' a thriller, reaches theaters in September. It has three television series on the air, but only one, ''Spin City,'' has a strong chance of generating enough episodes to produce profits from rerun sales, several television executives said. And George Michael's new album ''Older,'' Dreamworks' first major record, has had a lackluster reception. **********At any other company, such a record would doom executives to relentless and loud criticism. And in Hollywood there are those who say privately that so far Dreamworks is a disappointment. **********But most acknowledge that even with the daunting risks of starting a new entertainment company, particularly at a difficult time for the industry, the Dreamworks' team has a respectable chance of pulling it off. ''There are only two brand names in the business: Disney and Spielberg, and Dreamworks has one of them,'' said John Tinker, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. ''They have a strong capital base and experienced management. That gives them a tremendous advantage. **********''The question is: Can they survive given the increasing capital costs and risks in the business?'' he said. **********But no one is willing to bet against David Geffen's deal-making skills. Mr. Geffen built one of the biggest personal fortunes in Hollywood by creating and selling his record company to MCA for $550 million in stock in 1990. Within a year, he cashed out for $710 million when Matsushita Electrical Industrial bought MCA. **********Perhaps the greatest reason for caution is that Dreamworks' biggest bet, the business on which its future rises and falls, is animated films. Ron Nelson, the company's chief financial officer, anticipates that 40 percent to 50 percent of Dreamworks' profits will come from animation. **********Three hundred animators are now working on its first release, ''The Prince of Egypt,'' which is not due out until Thanksgiving 1998. Another 100 animators are preparing ''El Dorado: City of Gold,'' for the following year and smaller teams are working on the computer-generated films, ''Ants'' and ''Shrek.'' That means about 40 percent of the staff is at work on animation. **********Animation is Mr. Katzenberg's first love, and where he built his reputation during his 13 years at the Walt Disney Company. Clearly he wants to prove he can do it again. But he also wants to do it differently from Disney. **********At the moment, Mr. Katzenberg does not anticipate Dreamworks' rivaling the Disney machine in marketing and merchandising film-related products. The company is still debating whether product tie-ins, Disney's huge profit machine driven by animated hits, are appropriate for ''Prince of Egypt.'' **********''It's not even a movie that the Disney Company would ever have made,'' Mr. Katzenberg said, during a short work break. ''For them there have to be stores and parks and merchandise.'' **********Mr. Katzenberg, who is suing Disney in a bitter battle over compensation, may be seeking his vindication, but economics also play a role. Successful animated films, even before profits from merchandising, promise a windfall. Moses, like Bugs Bunny, does not demand a huge salary. Disney's film division, fueled by animation hits, averaged 17 percent operating profit margins between 1992 and 1995, compared with about 10 percent at Warner Brothers, the industry's second-most-profitable studio, David Londoner, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim & Company, noted. **********If Mr. Katzenberg is fully immersed in the roughly $60 million production of ''Prince of Egypt,'' his partners played a central role in deciding to adopt the Biblical story as the company's first, defining animation effort. **********As Mr. Katzenberg tells the story, at one of the team's earliest meetings, ''Steven asked me: ''Could you start another animation company,'' Mr. Katzenberg recalled. ''Steven said to me; 'You know the one thing that I looked at as a competitor -- the thing you did at Disney -- was starting with an unbelievably great idea. How did you pick them?' '' **********''I listed what we looked for in picking a subject: a great theme, allegorical: not only does it have to be a good story, but it has to tell you something about humanity. You need a great villain. You need great music that moves you from one place in the story to another. **********''When I finished listing the requirements, Steven said, 'Oh, like the 10 Commandments.' And David said, 'What a great idea.' '' **********But Mr. Spielberg's major role involves live-action films, where operations have been slow to get off the ground. For one thing, Mr. Spielberg has been finishing up films for Amblin Entertainment, including directing ''Lost World,'' the ''Jurassic Park'' sequel. And Walter Parks, who together with his wife, Laurie MacDonald, was brought to Dreamworks from Amblin to head the movie division under Mr. Spielberg, acknowledged, ''We have been pulled between the two endeavors.'' **********There are rumors in Hollywood that neither Mr. Geffen nor Mr. Katzenberg is particularly happy with the progress at the film division. And even Mr. Parks said, ''We have been trying to hire another executive to help.'' **********But both Mr. Geffen and Mr. Katzenberg deny they have any concerns. Mr. Katzenberg said that ''it is complete and utter nonsense; David and I are very pleased with how things are going.'' **********In one scheduling change that will help fill the pipeline faster, Mr. Spielberg, who had not planned to direct his first Dreamworks picture until next summer, will start directing ''Amistad,'' a story of black slaves  put on trial for murder, in February. And the company has recently announced production plans for several new films this year. **********The company's most visible efforts have been in television, where at least one series -- ''Spin City,'' with Michael J. Fox -- is likely to make it to syndication. It now ranks 11th in the Nielsen ratings. **********Two other shows are more problematic -- ''Ink,'' about a newspaperman, ranks 35th and ''High Incident'' survives though it ranks a precarious 85th. A fourth show, ''Champs,'' lasted just six episodes early last year. **********Dreamworks has not been shy about spending money. Not only has it locked up top television talent, but it has hired top executives at other divisions, including Mo Austin, the former Warner Music executive who was eagerly courted by Disney, among others. And it has expanded its initial plans to enter the business of interactive games, a field in which its initial offering, ''Goosebumps'' is  doing well. **********But the company is still physically scattered on several sites. A deal to move to Playa Vista has been bogged down in disputes between the developers and some real estate investors. **********Deamworks does not disclose its finances, but so far, Mr. Nelson contended, the company was ahead of budget in part because it had not ''ramped up its feature film division,'' Mr. Nelson said. But unlike other start-ups, it has a strong capital base. The three partners together hold 67 percent of the company, having put up $33 million each. The two other key investors are the former Microsoft executive, Paul Allen, who committed $492.5 million for an 18 percent stake, while Mie Kyung Lee, a scion of the Samsung Electronics family, invested $300 million for an 11 percent stake. A consortium of banks agreed to put up $1 billion in credit. **********Dreamworks executives say that they are not expecting to show any profits for at least five years. But neither Mr. Allen nor Ms. Lee seem impatient. In a telephone interview from South Korea, Ms. Lee said: ''We're very happy with the relationship with Jeffrey and David. I don't care about getting our money out ASAP.'' Asked what kind of return she anticipated, Ms. Lee said: ''I can't come up with the numbers right now. My brother is a better numbers expert.'' **********An investor could cash out if the company were sold or went public, said Alan Patricof, a longtime venture capitalist who heads his own firm. But several traditional venture capitalists said they doubted that Dreamworks would produce the 35 to 40 percent average annual returns that have characterized the best deals. **********''For an investor to get 35 percent in three years, Dreamworks would have to have at least a $6 billion valuation,'' Mr. Patricof noted. MCA, one of the Hollywood giants, was valued at about $7 billion when it was sold to Seagram in 1995. **********''The game is always to build a pool of assets so that somwhehwere down the road you can sell it to somebody else, go public or sell it back to the company for a big capital gain, '' said Harold Vogel, an analyst at Cowen & Company. **********Mr. Allen, however, does not share the venture capitalist timetable nor does he see Dreamworks as a classical venture-capital bet on a ''bunch of long shots. **********''Here they have a proven track record of working together,'' Mr. Allen said. ''It's like investing with Bill Gates. If you have one Windows or Excel, things could be fantastic.'' Indeed, the value of companies in the entertainment industry has risen steadily. **********From Mr. Geffen's point of view, ''I think what we have accomplished is extraordinary.'' He noted that Dreamworks has been in business with its financing for two years or less. But even he is a realist about  the risks in the movie business. **********Speaking about ''Prince of Egypt'' he said: ''I think it is one of the most fantastic animated movies ever made. Having said that, it will come out and we will see how it does.'' **********After two years, the same can be said of Dreamworks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/16/business/dissecting-retirement-programs-and-suggesting-surgery.html": {"writer_name": "Fred Brock", "pub_date": "1997-03-16", "snippet": "Roundup of feature articles in personal-finance magazines; article in Kiplinger's discusses future of Social Security; article in Money magazine discusses high fees charged on some 401 (k) retirement plans; photo (M)", "word_count": 786, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dissecting Retirement Programs, and Suggesting Surgery", "print_headline": "Dissecting Retirement Programs, and Suggesting Surgery", "body_text": " **********IF retirement is on your mind, there is plenty to consider in the April batch of personal-finance magazines. **********''Saving Social Security,'' an article by Melynda Dovel Wilcox in Kiplinger's, is a clear and fairly comprehensive look at the ins and outs of Social Security and the problems it faces, which, the article says, aren't as terrible as some politicians are saying. **********In fact, many experts have said that if nothing is done between now and 2029, when the Social Security trust fund is expected to be ''bankrupt,'' revenue from payroll taxes will still be enough to pay 75 percent of promised benefits. So the trick is figuring out how to make up the other 25 percent. **********Kiplinger's endorses a middle-of-the-road plan -- what one economist calls ''everyone's second choice'' -- promoted by Edward Gramlich, dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan and chairman of the Advisory Council on Social Security. The plan would create the equivalent of a national 401(k) tax-deferred retirement plan that would work in tandem with Social Security. It would not divert money now flowing into the system, but would be financed with an extra contribution of 1.6 percent of pay. The proposal would then slow the growth of Social Security benefits, mainly for middle-  and high-wage workers, but the gap -- in theory -- would be made up by the extra 1.6 percent in contributions. **********One complaint about the Kiplinger's article is that it makes no mention of the regressive nature of the Social Security tax. Everyone pays the same rate on annual earnings of up to $65,400 for the current year, but no one pays a cent on earnings above that amount. This means that high-income people are paying the tax on only a portion -- in many cases a small portion -- of their incomes, while middle-  and low-income workers are paying the tax on all or most of their earnings. What about raising the cutoff point instead of the rate? **********401(k) WOES Money magazine, in an article by Penelope Wang, contends that ''excessive'' and often ''hidden'' fees on some 401(k) plans are cheating American workers out of an estimated $1.5 billion a year. Some of these fees, Money says, are up to seven times as high as charges by moderately priced mutual funds or institutional investment managers. The magazine says a typical 35-year-old worker who participated in a high-cost plan for 30 years would retire with 25 percent less than he or she would have collected under a low-cost plan -- a shortfall estimated to average $244,000. **********Many companies, Money continues, fail to protect employees' interests, and some small businesses are barely better informed about 401(k) costs than their workers are. The magazine advises that you  find out the cost of your 401(k) plan and pressure your employer to minimize fees, even if it means switching plans. **********MEDICARE PITFALLS The April-May issue of Your Money has some practical advice for dealing with Medicare and so-called Medigap insurance.

Summers, assured Congress that the Clinton Administration had delivered a ''strong protest'' to the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo. Justice Department officials said they, too, had confronted the Mexicans over the affair, demanding that the incident be investigated fully. **********Mexican officials have insisted from the start that the uproar over the money-laundering case was a  misunderstanding on the part of the United States. And in interviews over the last week, the Mexican officials  provided some evidence suggesting that if the drug-trafficking suspect,  Rigoberto Gaxiola Medina, got wind of the plan to seize his money, it happened after Mexican authorities moved against his bank accounts. **********According to Mexican officials, money did not flow out of Mr. Gaxiola's accounts in the days after the Mexican Government moved to freeze them. Instead, more than $15 million was deposited. **********''We can see that there was no flight of money,'' said a senior finance official in the Mexican Government, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. ''There was more money in the accounts when they were seized than there was when we presented the complaint to seize them.'' **********Clinton Administration officials said they originally concluded that Mr. Gaxiola (pronounced ''gah-she-OH-la'') had probably been tipped off to the money laundering investigation because officials of Mexico's Finance Ministry had notified Mexico's Treasury Department on Jan. 8 that they were filing a seizure order that cited 15 of Mr. Gaxiola's accounts and involved more than $183 million. **********According to two confidential chronologies of the affair produced by American officials, agents of Mexico's National Institute for Combating Drugs did not act on the order until Jan. 20. **********Moreover, American officials noted, the Mexican official in charge of actually confiscating the money, Col. Jose Felix Name, the institute's chief of investigations, was himself suspect. The colonel was arrested and charged with allowing a man accused of being one of Mexico's most important money launderers, Humberto Garcia Abrego, to escape from custody. That incident came to light last month just as President Clinton was certifying Mexico's cooperation in the fight against drugs. **********Finally, when the Mexican authorities reported back to the United States Customs Service on the Gaxiola case, they said first that the  accounts in question had been ''depleted,'' and then that only about $16.7 million had been seized. **********In later interviews, Mexican officials said that the Americans had got it wrong from the start: the seizure order was for $183 million, the officials said, because that was all the money that Mr. Gaxiola was suspected of having laundered, the total he had deposited in all of the accounts over 30 months. The $183 million figure took no account of the frequent withdrawals, they said. **********The episode is unlikely to change any American minds about the depth of corruption in Mexican law enforcement. But it has opened a small window on the Clinton Administration's recent struggle to be tougher with Mexico on Capitol Hill while remaining conciliatory with the Mexican Government on its own turf. **********''We can't just beat them up every time something like this comes to light,'' one United States official involved in the case said of his Mexican counterparts. ''Stuff like this happens all the time. We still have to work with these people.'' **********Mexican finance officials did not present their version of events to their Treasury Department counterparts until after the reports of the case appeared in American newspapers. Why the explanation took so long is unclear, but it may have a lot to do with the way in which American ''protests'' were delivered. **********However thunderous the complaints of United States officials like Mr. Summers might have sounded when he related them to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in an appearance on March 12, three Mexican officials said they interpreted the comments quite differently. **********Clinton Administration officials said an Assistant Attorney General, Mary Lee Warren, had protested the seeming disappearance of the money on March 11 at a meeting of law-enforcement officials of the two countries in Mexico City. But a senior Mexican Justice official who was present said ''in no way'' did the Americans complain about the matter. **********''There was no expression of protest,'' said the Mexican official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''They asked for a search for the money. All that was was a request that we work together to find the money.'' **********The same day, the Assistant Treasury Secretary in charge of enforcement matters, James E. Johnson, also telephoned the Mexican Deputy Finance Minister handing the Gaxiola case, Ismael Gomez Gordillo, and protested the matter to him, American officials said. **********But senior Mexican officials familiar with the conversation insisted that, once again, ''protest'' would be far too strong a word for what they said was Mr. Johnson's softly worded expression of concern and his  request that the two governments work together to sort the problem out. **********American officials said two United States Treasury officials, Mr. Summers and one of his aides, did voice displeasure over the incident more sharply. But they did so in telephone conversations with a different Deputy Finance Minister, who apparently knew little about the Gaxiola case. **********The Treasury Department's chief spokesman, Howard M. Schloss, suggested yesterday that United States officials were still not satisfied with the Mexicans' explanations. **********''There have been discussions with Mexican officials about this, but we are still investigating the matter,''  he said in a telephone interview. **********According to information that Mexican officials provided to Washington last week, Mr. Gaxiola's accounts contained only about $393,000 on Dec. 31. On Jan 10, just before the Mexican Government moved to seize the accounts, they contained $1.47 million. But on Jan. 23, after the money was frozen, the combined balance was up to $16.7 million. **********''If there was a tip-off,'' one Mexican official asked, ''why would Gaxiola make all those deposits?'' **********Senior Mexican officials said that in one major transfer, on Oct. 30, Mr. Gaxiola sent $15 million from one of his Mexico accounts to a Chase Manhattan Bank branch in New York, and then on to another bank, apparently in the Cayman Islands. **********But according to an inquiry by Sonora state officials, Mr. Gaxiola's accounts apparently contained more than $110 million at some point in  1996. The Mexican officials said they had no further information about where that money went or when it was withdrawn."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/07/business/credit-markets-price-of-long-bond-rises-a-bit-as-auctions-stir-demand.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1997-11-07", "snippet": "Treasury bonds with long maturities bounce back from early weakness to finish higher for second day, after Government's quarterly debt refunding concludes with strong demand; 30-year bond rises 17/32, to price of 102 19/32, with yield falling to 6...", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Price of Long Bond Rises a Bit as Auctions Stir Demand", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Price of Long Bond Rises a Bit as Auctions Stir Demand", "body_text": " **********Treasury bonds with long maturities bounced back from early weakness yesterday to finish higher for a second day, after the Government's quarterly debt refunding concluded with strong demand.

Some investors, who have been pushing bond and stock prices higher on the belief that growth is moderate and inflation tame, wondered whether the Federal Reserve would now need to apply the brakes with an increase in interest rates. **********''We've kind of shattered the old conviction of no Fed tightening,'' said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus Corporation. **********Bond and stock prices tumbled after the report, although stocks later recovered. The Dow Jones industrial average, which earlier fell 1 percent, ended the day down 28.57 points, or less than half a percent. Bond prices, however, continued to slide, driving the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for consumer interest rates like mortgages -- to 6.45 percent, from 6.29 percent on Thursday. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions. **********While the employment report revived Wall Street's fears of higher interest rates -- which eat into corporate profits and make bonds less attractive -- it confirmed the improved position of job seekers. The unemployment rate for black teen-agers, for example, fell by more than four percentage points, to 28.6 percent, the lowest since 1969. **********Over all, 316,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls last month, well above expectations and above a revised 228,000 jobs in June. When combined with a modest increase in the labor force, the jobless ranks contracted by 253,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 4.8 percent, from 5 percent in June -- matching the rate in May and the lowest since November 1973. **********At the same time, however, the average hourly earnings of production workers were unchanged while their weekly earnings fell because of a shorter workweek. **********The Clinton Administration applauded the July jobs report. **********''This morning we have further evidence that the strategy of balancing the budget while investing in our people and selling more American products around the world has helped to produce sustained prosperity for Americans,'' President Clinton said today. ''There is no doubt that the economic strategy we put in place in 1993 created the conditions for the extraordinary private-sector growth.'' **********July's gains in jobs showed that the May report was no fluke, said Nicholas S. Perna, economist for the Fleet Financial Group in Boston. ''The most important thing is that the unemployment rate is clearly below 5 percent again,'' he said. **********Mr. Perna and other economists worry that such low unemployment will soon drive up wages and spur inflation. **********Further signs of economic growth came in a survey today by the National Association of Purchasing Management. The association's report, which covers manufacturing, showed its overall index rising to 58.6 from 55.7, while the production index leaped by 8.4 points, to 64.4. **********Rising for the first time in four months, the group's price index surged to 53.6 from 48.1, with 17 percent of members reporting paying higher prices compared with 13 percent in May and June. The index of supplier deliveries climbed to 55.3 from 54.6, which the association said meant that ''deliveries are slowing at a faster rate.'' **********In other reports, the Commerce Department said that orders placed with factories rose 1.2 percent in June, more than recovering a drop of five-tenths of 1 percent in May. The department also said that Americans' income grew six-tenths of 1 percent in June, while spending rose three-tenths of 1 percent. **********While today's reports raised expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers might increase rates, few analysts expect them to do so at their next meeting on Aug. 19. **********Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis consulting firm, told clients today that ''despite the continued benign behavior of wages, the further tightening of labor markets will be of concern to the Fed and keeps the possibility of a tightening alive, although almost certainly not before'' the Fed's September meeting. **********The 316,000 jump in employer payrolls last month was well above expectations, though the total was swollen by a 48,000 increase in local education that was statistically suspect because of changing seasonal patterns of the school year. Teachers are considered employed year-round, but others, like cafeteria workers and sports referees, move on and off education payrolls and may or may not take unrelated jobs. **********But the report showed a 31,000 advance in health service jobs following an unusually weak June, a 65,000 surge in retail trade -- half in restaurants and bars -- and a 26,000 gain for the finance-insurance-real estate category that was more than twice the monthly average over the last year. **********Factory jobs, however, were flat with 20,000 additional people producing durable goods more than offset by 25,000 fewer producing nondurables. **********The workweek shortened by 18 minutes and factory overtime also fell, suggesting to some that employers were confident enough to add permanent workers, which tends to reduce the need for long hours. The index of aggregate weekly hours fell seven-tenths of a point, to 139.9. **********Another reflection of July strength, analysts said, was the resumed increase in the percentage of the unemployed who voluntary left their latest job, typically because they thought they could readily find another one. This percentage was 12.6 percent in July, up from 12.2 in May and June and 11.2 in April. **********By region, the West showed the most improvement, with its July unemployment rate declining three-tenths of a point, to 5.3 percent.

But the real concern may be whether investors have become too giddy. **********A recent survey of mutual fund investors would suggest so, raising the possibility they may be laying the basis for a major disappointment. **********The survey by Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco found investors expected an average annual return of 34 percent over the next 10 years, a figure that shocked many financial advisers because it is so far above historical averages. **********''People have become completely enamored of the stock market; there's a love affair with it,'' said Raymond DeVoe, a market strategist at Legg Mason.

Rebounds like that inspire confidence, analysts said. **********But what few investors know is that despite the outsized gains of recent years, the last 30 years have actually produced below-average returns, when adjusted for inflation. In other words, the great bull market that began in 1982 has not yet been powerful enough to undo the damage done in the previous 15 years, which included the bear market of 1973-74. **********For some Wall Street analysts who lived through less exalted times, therein lies a lesson: beware first-time investors. Although these may be extraordinary times, history suggests that long-term stock market returns are much tamer, and so it is unlikely that stocks will continue to rise at this torrid pace. **********In fact, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered just such a warning two weeks ago, when he cautioned investors that it would be ''unrealistic'' to expect stock returns to keep rising at the current rate. **********For the last three years, the market has done little wrong. Few investors have suffered since the sharp increase in prices that helped send the Dow to gains of 33 percent in 1995, 26 percent in 1996 and 25 percent so far this year. **********Never before has the Dow had three consecutive years with gains of 20 percent or more. Logical Information Machines, a research concern in Chicago, said that the current three-year run was one of the greatest of all time. **********Those kinds of returns bolster optimism. Earlier this year, the Montgomery survey showed investors expected annual returns of about 22 percent over the next 10 years, compared with 34 percent in the most recent tally. **********At a 34 percent pace, the Dow average would exceed 120,000 in the year 2007. That is assuming a dividend yield of about 3 percent, which is well above current prices. **********Is such a gain likely? Theodore Aronson at Aronson & Partners, a money management firm based in Philadelphia, said the best 10-year run for the Dow average was 17.1 percent, in the period ending in June 1959. What does Mr. Aronson think of those who are expecting a 34 percent return? ''They must have polled the loony bin,'' he said. **********Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, is gentler. He cautioned investors not to get too excited. **********His studies show that after inflation, stocks achieve an average annual return of about 7 percent, going all the way back to 1802. In spite of wars, social upheavals and and other bumps on the road of history, stock returns tend to settle at that level. **********''The long-run return is always the same, about 7 percent,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''I've found this remarkable stability over time.'' **********In the last 30 years, however, stock returns have trailed slightly, he said. The average stock return from 1966 to 1997 was about 6.03 percent compounded annually, nearly a percentage point below the historical average of 6.99 percent, after inflation. **********In mid-1967, for instance, the Dow stood at 860.25.

His closest rival, the Speaker of the Parliament, had 25 percent. About 90 percent of the eligible voters went to the polls, the radio said.$) **********The four candidates who ran for President were handpicked by the Council of Guardians, the country's highest religious body, and the fact that the council approved Mr. Khatami's candidacy signifies that he is considered well within the ideological boundaries that it considers acceptable. But he is the first Iranian leader since the revolution that overthrew Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi who has dared to say that many revolutionary policies need to be reappraised. **********Mr. Khatami did not issue a victory statement, but his principal opponent, Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri, conceded defeat this afternoon. **********''I hope that you will prove able to comply with the Constitution and all our laws,'' Mr. Nategh-Nouri said in a statement addressed to his rival. ''I wish you luck and success, and will cooperate fully with you.'' **********The results showed that Mr. Khatami did well not only in cities and towns, where intellectuals are concentrated and where people are more resentful of the Government's social and economic policies, but also in villages and rural outposts. **********It was an almost unimaginable triumph for a candidate who had been considered an outsider since beginning his campaign in January and who had been attacked in the pro-Government press as a liberal with weak Islamic credentials. **********There were signs all week that Mr. Khatami was attracting wide public support. But many Iranians, accustomed to a form of politics in which the religious leaders always seemed able to impose their will, doubted that he could win. Leading clerics, including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, had made clear that they favored the candidacy of Mr. Nategh-Nouri. **********There is no modern tradition in Iran of street demonstrations to cheer election results, and Teheran was quiet today. But in some offices and homes, there were broad smiles that reflected a sense of satisfaction and wonder at what the electorate had managed to achieve. **********The vote showed Iranians that they have the power to influence their political structure, something many had come to doubt after generations of autocratic rule, first under the Shah and now under the Islamic Government. It also showed that people here no longer feel obligated to follow the direction of their political and religious leaders, a change that could have profound implications. **********Mr. Khatami will not take office until August. He is expected to name an entirely new Cabinet, replacing among other people Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who has been the Government's most recognized international spokesman since the days when he defended the takeover of the United States Embassy and seizure of hostages here in 1979. **********$(A White House spokesman said: ''We're watching the situation carefully and have no opposition to the Iranian people or an Islamic government. We need to see if there will be actual change in behavior in those issues which have concerned us in the past such as terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and human rights.''$) **********The new Government is likely to include more technocrats and fewer religious figures. The departing President, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was barred by law from seeking re-election and who obliquely supported Mr. Khatami during the campaign, will probably be one of his leading allies. **********Mr. Rafsanjani has been viewed as a moderate, though he was stymied at many points by religious forces. He will continue to hold considerable power as head of the Expediency Council, a powerful body charged with mediating between political and religious leaders. **********In an interview today as the results were being announced, Ahmad Borghani, a close aide and spokesman for the President-elect, said Mr. Khatami would ''try to make changes as best he can.'' **********He said one of the first priorities would be legalizing political parties, which have been effectively outlawed since the revolution. **********''Of course Mr. Khatami will not continue the present restrictions on the press and media,'' Mr. Borghani said. ''He will have an open policy toward them.'' **********Mr. Borghani also suggested that the new Government would seek to curb the police and religious militia whose members patrol streets and neighborhoods in search of people who are having parties, listening to forbidden music, watching imported videos or satellite television, playing cards or otherwise violating the social code. **********''We have heard Mr. Khatami say that people should not investigate other people's private lives,'' Mr. Borghani said. ''If people want to listen to music, they should turn it down so it does not disturb their neighbors. Otherwise it is fine.'' **********In a document last week outlining his principles, Mr. Khatami said he was dedicated to ''countering superstition and fanaticism'' and ''assuring civil rights and freedoms of citizens.'' He pledged to curb censorship, to recognize the ''variety and diversity of attitudes'' and to combat the view ''that politics should be monopolized by a specific group.'' **********Young people formed the backbone of Mr. Khatami's political campaign. Throughout the country they volunteered with an enthusiasm many had never before shown for a political candidate. In a country where 70 percent of the population is said to be under the age of 25, they form a key constituency that does not feel bound by the ideology that brought the revolutionary Government to power when they were young or even before they were born. **********To satisfy them, Mr. Khatami will not only have to give them more personal freedom but also make economic changes that will cut the power of state-backed monopolies and end what he has called ''unfair economic concessions.'' **********The other group that gave especially strong support to Mr. Khatami was women. Because they played an important role in the 1979 revolutionary movement and because many of them supported the eight-year war with Iraq, women here have great political power. **********Although under Islamic law introduced following the revolution they must still cover themselves in public, they have more rights than women in some other Muslim countries. But many are assertive and unsatisfied, and complain about laws that discriminate against them. **********In addition to facing a possibly unhappy group of clerics who were dubious about his candidacy to begin with, Mr. Khatami will find the 275-member Parliament less than friendly. Most members supported his rival, and many are deeply suspicious of all reformist thought."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/29/business/international-briefs-richemont-to-buy-the-rest-of-vendome.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-11-29", "snippet": "Cie Financiere Richemont of Switzerland plans to buy 30 percent of Vendome Luxury Group of Britain that it does not own for 1.036 billion pounds ($1.73 billion) (S)", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Richemont to Buy The Rest of Vendome", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Richemont to Buy The Rest of Vendome", "body_text": " **********Cie.

He was 82. **********So well known was Mr. Bertone among auto aficionados that when Volvo introduced a special series of limited-production two-door sports cars in the United States in 1991, they were not only designed and their bodies built by Mr. Bertone, but they also bore his signature on a plaque on the dashboard. **********Giuseppe Bertone, known by the nickname Nuccio, was born in Turin, where his father in 1912 founded a workshop producing body parts by hand. Under the younger Mr. Bertone's aegis, the company was gradually transformed into an industrial enterprise, specializing not only in the design but also the manufacture of cars in small series, and of parts for cars. **********As a boy, he often told friends and colleagues, he grew strong on a diet of ''bread and cars.'' **********In the 1950's, when Europe's automobile industry was re-emerging from the destruction of World War II, Mr. Bertone achieved his first great success, designing in 1954 the classic Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint, an early version of the Alfa Romeo Spider, which later gained fame as the car Dustin Hoffman drove in the 1967 film ''The Graduate.'' Though only 500 of the Sprints were originally planned, Alfa ultimately built 40,000. **********Mr. Bertone produced numerous models for the Italian car makers Fiat and Alfa Romeo but some of his most exciting work was done for Lamborghini, whose low-slung models, the cheapest of them costing well into six figures, were noted for their beautiful design, strong performance -- and road rusting. **********At the 1966 Geneva Auto Show, Mr. Bertone stunned the auto world with the introduction of the Lamborghini Miura, a powerful sports model with a centrally placed engine whose shark-like nose set a standard for many later designs. Other exotic Lamborghini models, notably the Espada and the Countach, followed. In 1973 he produced the Fiat X 1/9, a two-door model that like his other products excelled for its sleek line and aggressive animal-like looks. Another model by Mr. Bertone favored among sports car collectors, the Ferrari Dino 308 GT4, rivaled his earlier work. **********''In the beginning there is man, alone with his thought, his soul, and his professional spirit, capable of intuitions that are at once great and fragile, simple and complex,'' Mr. Bertone once said of his work, typically emphasizing the intuitive element of his creativity. ''Later on comes the design, the trials, production and computers.'' **********Until the oil crises of the 1970's injected a note of sobriety into the automobile industry, Mr. Bertone shone at the center of a brilliant group of automotive and industrial designers in Turin that included Pinin Farina, Giorgio Giugiaro and Marcello Gandini. **********''As a stylist, Bertone knew marvelously well how to unite his inborn good taste, his great sense of class and his passion for sports cars,'' said Mr. Giugiaro, who joined Mr. Bertone's company in 1959 at age 21, and now heads one of Italy's leading design studios. **********Among Mr. Bertone's most recent designs were the convertible versions of both the Fiat Punto and the Opel Astra, which is built by the German unit of General Motors. **********Mr. Bertone was not only an esthete and designer, but an avid skier and sailor as well. **********The industrial group Mr. Bertone formed employs today about 1,500 people and had revenue last year of $320 million. In 1995, an electric car designed by the Bertone group, called Zer, with an aerodynamic, rocket-shaped body, set a record for electrically propelled vehicles when it achieved a top speed of 188.5 miles an hour. **********Mr. Bertone, who attended only grade school, held an honorary degree in engineering from the Turin Polytechnic. **********He is survived by his wife, Lilly, and two daughters, Marie Jeanne and Barbara, all of Turin."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/29/world/cambodian-chief-puts-on-show-of-government-as-usual.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1997-07-29", "snippet": "Hun Sen, Cambodia's de facto leader, seeks to legitimize seizure of power with elaborate demonstration of government as usual; newly obedient Parliament convenes and moves toward confirmation of his choice of new co-Prime Minister, Foreign Min Ung...", "word_count": 862, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cambodian Chief Puts on Show of Government as Usual", "print_headline": "Cambodian Chief Puts on Show of Government as Usual", "body_text": " **********Armed force gave way to parliamentary theater today as Cambodia's de facto leader, Hun Sen, sought to legitimize his seizure of power with an elaborate demonstration of government as usual. **********Tamed by Mr. Hun Sen's coup three weeks ago, and minus 20 royalist-party legislators who have fled the country, a newly obedient Parliament convened this morning and moved toward confirmation of Mr. Hun Sen's choice of a new co-Prime Minister. **********The pageantry was a curious echo of the show trial that has just been completed by Cambodia's outlawed Khmer Rouge, in which the guerrilla movement also sought to make itself more presentable by condemning its notorious leader, Pol Pot. **********But a Western diplomat said such formulaic exercises were not the way power is exercised in Cambodia.  ''In many ways this is still a feudal country,'' he said. ''What the chief says is what counts.'' **********With his armed ouster of Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whose title was First Prime Minister, Mr. Hun Sen wiped away much of the democratic process that had been fostered here four years ago by the United Nations. **********In doing so, he brought his country closer to the kind of strongman rule he exercised in the 1980's as the designated leader of the occupying Vietnamese Army, and closer to the style of the Khmer Rouge themselves. **********''This was an assembly of fear,'' said an American lawyer who has observed the legislature here. ''The rule of law Cambodia-style is to apply the law when it suits you but to ignore it when it doesn't.'' **********Having taken the law into his own hands three weeks ago, Mr. Hun Sen is now intent on seeking international legitimacy by restoring the forms of a coalition government and proceeding with an election by next May. **********With a drum roll and a brass-band fanfare, 97 gray-suited legislators trooped through the muggy morning today into Parliament's tiny, red-carpeted chamber.

''There is other business today that is more important to go through,'' he said, as if nothing unusual were going on. ''So that issue has to wait.'' **********Mr. Ung Huot was also asked about a new procedural complication to his anointing as Prince Ranariddh's successor: an announcement on Sunday by the Prince, who is now in Thailand, that Mr. Ung Huot had been expelled from the party. **********''I expected that,'' said Mr. Ung Huot, who was once a close ally of the Prince. ''This is something like a joke, a sign of desperation. He cannot just sack anyone while he is running away.'' **********In Thailand, where a number of royalist legislators have taken refuge because of fears of persecution, one member of Parliament, Ahmad Yahya, said people like Mr. Ung Huot had ''sold their soul'' to Mr. Hun Sen. **********Like other legislators in Thailand, Mr. Yahya fled in the first days after the coup following news that some of Mr. Hun Sen's political opponents had been killed. No legislators have been reported killed. **********''To call for a national assembly while the people are still scared, and to expect it to recognize Ung Huot, it is unfair,'' Mr. Yahya said on Saturday. **********The spokesman for the royalists who have remained in Cambodia, Pou Sothirak, offered his reply to that, saying it is necessary to keep struggling for the country's welfare.

''I think the final bill was $1,500 to $1,800, and the insurance paid for probably like $1,000.'' She stopped the coverage when Sam's expenses exceeded the policy's limit for the disease. **********Bob Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said pet insurance was on the list of coverage his group discouraged. Because most pets cost less than most pet insurance deductibles, the financially minded person -- heartless as it sounds to many pet lovers -- might refuse heroic treatment if Rover gets run over. Still, Mr. Hunter owns up to spending more than his Border collie was worth in treating her for arthritis before her recent death. **********''For some very limited number of people, because of the incredible attachment that occurs, pet insurance might make some sense,'' he said, but he remains skeptical. ''It's no accident that most pet insurance was invented by vets, who are jealous of health insurance for people and of the high-price procedures that allows.'' **********Pet insurance has its drawbacks. It is, of course, not as well regulated as insurance for humans. Many policies do not cover pre-existing conditions, and it can be hard to get coverage for elderly pets. **********''Most of the policies don't cover routine health maintenance, so you have that expense anyway,'' said Jim Stevenson, spokesman for the Washington State insurance commissioner's office. **********But health care for pets is changing. At some clinics, pet owners can buy care plans that emphasize disease prevention and include basic vaccinations and other services. Medical Management International, based in Portland, Ore., operates Vetsmart pet hospitals and health centers in 92 Petsmart pet supply stores in nine states. In New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and three other states, smaller Vetsmart ''wellness clinics'' -- for shots and other routine care -- operate in 76 Petsmart stores. **********''This is the closest thing you'll find to an H.M.O.,'' said Alex Schrage, a spokesman for Vetsmart in Portland. He said Vetsmart  treated 20,000 pets a week. **********Services include vaccines, heartworm tests and medication, fluoride treatments, and even a discount on flea prevention, depending on the plan. There are also discounts on care for sick or injured pets. The one-time membership fee ranges from $59 to $199, with a monthly fee of $9 to $35. **********Kristen Warner of Portland said she was pleased with the attention that Vetsmart gave her dogs, Buck and Reno, and her cat, Missy. **********''The customer service there is amazing, and they answer all your questions,'' Ms. Warner said. ''They're very patient.'' **********Veterinary Pet Insurance, based in Anaheim, Calif., was started by a group of 750 veterinarians who did not like seeing animals put to death because owners could not afford costly care. They also saw a business opportunity. **********Dr. Jack Stephens, a veterinarian and the company's president, said the company offered policies that start at $89 a year for puppies and kittens, and has sold more than 750,000 policies. It has covered some experimental procedures, like a $4,000 bone graft operation for a Great Dane with cancer. **********Some people worry that the tail is wagging the dog here -- that if insurance is available, veterinarians will be freer to use more expensive medical procedures, which would be out of the financial reach of many of the uninsured. **********The American Veterinary Medical Association supports pet insurance, calling such coverage ''important to the future of the veterinary profession's ability to provide high quality and up-to-date veterinary service.'' **********John Kelly, a veterinarian at Elliott Bay Animal Hospital in Seattle, said the policies were not used widely there, but that people who had them were satisfied. **********''We have to recognize that veterinary medicine, like human medicine, is becoming more expensive, with more diagnostics, ultrasound, specialized surgery, fiber optic endoscopes, root canals and orthodontic implants,'' he said. ''Vets have to buy the same equipment human hospitals do, but they can't charge as much.'' **********PET insurance is more established in Britain, where doting on dogs is a national pastime. British pet owners, for example, can buy an insurance plan from Pet Protect that covers the cost of a kennel for a pet if its owner is hospitalized, and vacation cancellation coverage if the owner has to miss a trip because a pet needs emergency surgery. **********The Humane Society of the United States, based in Washington, endorses efforts to help pet owners with medical care. But those efforts can be very simple, said Leslie  Sinclair, a veterinarian there. **********''You can put a few dollars out of every paycheck in a can in the freezer,'' she said, ''or open a savings account with Fluffy's name on it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/21/business/worldbusiness/IHT-germany-to-bear-brunt-of-adtranz-job-cuts.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "1997-10-21", "snippet": "Adtranz, a maker of railcars and locomotives jointly owned by Daimler-Benz AG of Germany and ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, announced plans Monday to cut 3,600 jobs in restructuring that will create a 1997 loss for the...", "word_count": 3219, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Germany to Bear Brunt of Adtranz Job Cuts", "print_headline": "Germany to Bear Brunt of Adtranz Job Cuts", "body_text": " **********Adtranz, a maker of railcars and locomotives jointly owned by Daimler-Benz AG of Germany and ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, announced plans Monday to cut 3,600 jobs in restructuring that will create a 1997 loss for the German-based group. **********Adtranz plans to make most of the job cuts in its German operations, the group's biggest single subsidiary, which employs 8,000, according to a spokesman at the Adtranz headquarters in Berlin. The German operations have posted losses since Adtranz was created last year to form the world's biggest supplier of rolling stock with total staff worldwide of 22,000. **********Severance payments to cover the job cuts will lead to a one-time charge of 150 million European currency units ($167 million), enough to swing the Adtranz group to a 1997 loss, Adtranz said. It will take the charge in the fourth quarter. Last year, the Adtranz group reported a pretax income of 21 million Ecus and revenue of 3.2 billion Ecus. **********The company's Italian plants also are slated to lose jobs, but to a lesser extent than the German-based plants, it said. The company will announce later in the year how the job cuts will be distributed among the factories. **********Because Adtranz employs only 550 people in Italy, more than 3,000 jobs will be cut in Germany, said the head of the company's workers council, Michael Wobst. **********Given the urgency to cut costs and the rigor of the restructuring, Adtranz said, it could not guarantee that it would keep all its plants open. \"We cannot guarantee any activity or any plant anymore,\" said an Adtranz spokesman, Peter Polzer. **********The company, present in 60 countries, has eight plants in Germany, including its flagship works in Hennigsdorf, near Berlin. Protests erupted earlier this year at the Hennigsdorf plant to denounce management's cost-cutting targets. Adtranz said it must cut operating costs in Germany by at least 35 percent to remain competitive. **********Adtranz already has begun exporting German jobs to low-wage Poland and Hungary, where it recently has acquired operations. Locomotive parts once made in Hennigsdorf now are built just over the border in Poland. **********The difficulties in the German operations at Adtranz reflect why Germany continues to post record unemployment figures three years into an economic recovery. German companies, which have high payroll costs, have been forced to lower their labor bill in order to remain competitive in world markets. **********Demand for railroad equipment in Asia is booming, but bidding competition for new railcars has driven costs downward, industry analysts said. The job cuts at Adtranz also reflect the pressure on Europe's railroad suppliers from public transport agencies that are struggling to control their costs. **********At Daimler's Stuttgart headquarters, a spokesman said the parent company believed that Adtranz had solid long-term prospects. \"We think this restructuring will improve their competitiveness,\" a Daimler spokesman said. **********\"We want to make clear that Daimler is sticking to Adtranz,\" the spokesman said. \"The industry is growing worldwide and Adtranz has the leading position.

Wirth, the Undersecretary of State for global environmental affairs, one of the greenest of the President's advisers and nominally the top official directly in charge of negotiations toward a new climate treaty. **********Mr. Wirth advocated an aggressive plan for significant cutbacks in the nation's emissions of greenhouse gases -- one that could have had significant costs for the economy. Bit by bit, that plan was scaled back as Mr. Clinton listened, and listened again, to the warnings of senior economic advisers like Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Janet L. Yellen. **********Mr. Wirth's decision -- to leave his post after the Kyoto talks to head a foundation created by the billionaire Ted Turner to support the United Nations -- followed a long, meandering and occasionally intense debate inside the White House that reflected many of the conflicts that bedevil climate change policy. **********The conflicts went beyond the traditional clash of green eyeshades and green armbands, to encompass opposing views on technology's potential and on ways of making predictions about unpredictable systems. The debate also pitted the old Bill Clinton, whose instinct would have been to side with Mr. Wirth's call for sweeping government action, against a new Bill Clinton, chastened by his health-care failure and acutely aware of the domestic impact of foreign policy. **********And it was shadowed by two futures: for Mr. Clinton, by a desire to shape his legacy, and for Vice President Al Gore, by the need to balance his strong environmental views against the coalition-building that leads up to a presidential run. **********FIVE years ago, President George Bush joined other leaders of developed nations in pledging at the Rio environmental summit to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Two years ago, when it was already clear that the U.S. and some other countries would miss that voluntary target, Mr. Clinton agreed to join an effort to come up with a binding treaty for reductions at Kyoto. **********In the struggle that followed, President Clinton's economic advisers stopped him from promising deep, quick cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases, but they argue that they did not win this debate; they say they merely acted as a counterweight to Mr. Wirth, Katie McGinty, the White House environmental adviser, and environmental groups. The President, his economic team notes, did not agree to delay cutbacks in emissions for as long as the economists had initially suggested. **********''The spin is that we won,'' one senior economic adviser to Mr. Clinton said recently. ''The reality was a little more muddled. We agreed there needed to be goals, even aggressive goals. But there also needed to be escape hatches, in case the economic effects turned out to be a lot more damaging than we thought.'' **********MR. CLINTON pledged that the United States would cut emissions to 1990 levels in the next 10 to 15 years. The turnabout in emissions will be encouraged at first with tax incentives and research subsidies for conservation and clean energy production. **********In later years, a cap will be placed on greenhouse emissions, coupled with a system to give credits for emissions reductions that companies can save and sell. It is a system in which the Government will set a mandatory goal but leave the mechanism to the market instead of turning to a Government fiat. **********If the Administration's approach delivers the promised reductions, emissions between 2008 and 2012 will be about a third lower than current trends would predict. **********But nobody knows how much that will cost. ''There is no credible, widely accepted economic analysis that currently exists in the United States, or in most other countries, that can answer very basic cost and benefit questions,'' said Eileen B. Claussen, a former senior aide to Mr. Wirth who had played an instrumental role in the talks but left the Administration a few months ago. **********It wasn't for lack of trying. The Administration struggled for two years to come up with a credible analysis of the economic effects of moving away from fossil fuels, but the uncertainties -- over things like what the United States economy will look like a decade from now, what technological advances in emissions controls will be made and how willing consumers and manufacturers will be to respond to economic incentives -- proved overwhelming. Ms. Yellen essentially declared the effort to come up with reliable numbers a failure last summer. **********That opened the door to something of a policy-making free-for-all that lasted well into the fall and has left many members of Congress wary, Ms. Claussen said. **********There was never any serious debate inside the Administration about the science of the issue; the White House has decided that the climate problem is real and serious. After all, the leading environmentalist of them all is Mr. Gore, and he long ago won over President Clinton on the need to do something about the threat of climate change. **********But as one of Mr. Clinton's top aides noted during the debate: ''Al has discovered it's a lot easier to write a book about the subject than to grapple with the economic costs. But he's getting the hang of it.'' **********In the end, Mr. Gore was highly receptive to the economic arguments, especially when the chorus of warnings included American business groups, whose support he will need when running for President. **********The real debate within the Administration pitted the pure economists against the technologists, the people who deal with the gross domestic product against those who specialize in British thermal units. **********The economists were deeply worried that any policy intended to drive down the use of fossil fuels -- especially a policy like the one the Administration favors, to put a cap on emissions of carbon dioxide and to let a market in emission permits dictate the price of fossil fuels -- would, in effect, amount to a system of energy rationing and energy taxes. In their rear-view mirrors, these advisers saw the economic disruptions of the oil shocks of the 1970's. **********But the technologists argued that the new policy would stimulate the appearance and rapid adoption of exciting new technologies that would make it possible to conserve energy and to produce more of it without fossil fuels. In their rear-view mirrors, they saw the efficiency gains and higher productivity that resulted from putting the nation on an energy diet in the 1970's and the 1980's. **********Both groups have economic models that prove their arguments. But no model is particularly well suited to predict what will happen to energy prices under the Clinton Administration's plan. That is because the plan calls for using inherently unpredictable free markets, rather than rigid regulations, to control emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. **********The Administration wants to put a fixed overall cap on the total emissions of greenhouse gases by industries. Then it would issue individual companies permits that would allow them to release a certain amount of the gases. Limiting the supply of something increasingly in demand generally has the effect of driving up its price. But the Administration hopes that the permits, which would be traded on a free market, will limit the price pressures on energy and encourage innovation instead. **********For instance, a company that found a cheap way to control carbon dioxide emissions could sell its extra permits to a company with high control costs. Both companies would benefit economically from the transaction, and the market in permits would stimulate the invention and adoption of the cheapest possible control technologies. **********The Administration hopes to extend the permit system worldwide, allowing poorer countries with low emissions to raise money by selling part of their right to emit greenhouse gases to developed countries that have plenty of cash but have bumped into their pollution limits. **********Selling this at Kyoto, where developing nations are demanding deeper, faster cuts, is shaping up as a daunting task. But Mr. Clinton has tried to build his second term on proposals to marry government goals and market mechanisms, and has always prided himself on his deal-making abilities. **********This time, it may be the deal of the next century."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/19/business/stocks-fall-sharply-in-japan-on-debt-and-economy-fears.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-12-19", "snippet": "Japanese stocks fall more than 5 percent after food-trading company, Toshoku Ltd, seeks court protection from heavy debts, raising fear that more bankruptcies and business failures will plague already frail economy; Nikkei index is down 811.59 poi...", "word_count": 300, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stocks Fall Sharply in Japan On Debt and Economy Fears", "print_headline": "Stocks Fall Sharply in Japan On Debt and Economy Fears", "body_text": " **********Japanese stocks fell more than 5 percent today after a food-trading company, Toshoku Ltd., sought court protection from heavy debts, raising fear that more bankruptcies and business failures would plague an already frail economy. **********It was the second sharp fall in Japanese stock prices and erased much of the remaining optimism from the Prime Minister's announcement Wednesday of a surprisingly large package of tax cuts and public works projects in hope of invigorating the economy. **********Orders involving Toshoku's creditors -- Sakura Bank, Yasuda Trust and Banking Company and the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan -- were not traded as sell orders overwhelmed offers to buy shares.

The average rate of warming probably would be be greater than any seen in the past 10,000 years. . . . Whereas many regions are likely to experience adverse effects of climate change -- some of which are potentially irreversible -- some effects of climate change are likely to be beneficial. . . . **********Ecosystems **********The primary influence of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems is expected to be through the rate and magnitude of change in climate means and extremes -- climate change is expected to occur at a rapid rate relative to the speed at which ecosystems can adapt and re-establish themselves -- and through the direct effects of increased atmosphere CO2 concentrations, which may increase the productivity and efficiency of water use in some plant species. Secondary effects of climate change involve changes in soil characteristics and disturbance regimes (e.g., fires, pests and diseases), which would favor some species over others. . . . **********The species composition of forests is likely to change; in some regions, entire forest types may disappear, while new assemblages of species and hence new ecosystems may be established. . . . In lakes and streams, warming would have the greatest biological effects at high latitudes -- where biological productivity would increase and lead to expansion of cool-water species' ranges -- and at the low-latitude boundaries of cold- and cool-water species ranges, where extinctions would be greatest. . . . **********Hydrology And Water Resources **********Currently, 1.3 billion people do not have access to adequate supplies of safe water, and 2 billion people do not have access to adequate sanitation. . . . **********This number is expected to roughly double by 2025, in large part because of increases in demand resulting from economic and population growth. . . . **********Changes in climate could exacerbate periodic and chronic shortfalls of water, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas of the world. Developing countries are highly vulnerable to climate change because many are located in arid and semi-arid regions, and most derive their water resources from single-point systems, such as bore holes or isolated reservoirs. . . . **********There is evidence that flooding is likely to become a larger problem in many temperate and humid regions, requiring adaptations not only to droughts and chronic water shortages but also to floods and associated damages, raising concerns about dam and levee failures. . . . **********Food and Fiber Production **********Generally, middle to high latitudes may experience increases in productivity, depending on crop type, growing season, changes in temperature regimes and the seasonality of precipitation. In the tropics and subtropics . . . yields are likely to decrease. The livelihoods of subsistence farmers and pastoral peoples, who make up a large portion of rural populations in some regions, also could be negatively affected. Marine fisheries production is expected to remain about the same. **********Coastal Systems **********An estimated 46 million people per year currently are at risk of flooding from storm surges. Climate change will exacerbate these problems . . . . Large numbers of people also are potentially affected by sea-level rise -- for example, tens of millions of people in Bangladesh would be displaced by a one-meter increase. **********Human Health **********Climate change could affect human health through increases in heat-stress mortality, tropical vector-borne diseases, urban air pollution problems and decreases in cold-related illnesses. Compared with the total burden of ill health, these problems are not likely to be large. In the aggregate, however, the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on human health do constitute a hazard to human population health, especially in the developing countries in the tropics and sub-tropics. . . ."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/09/business/market-timing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MARKET TIMING", "print_headline": "MARKET TIMING", "body_text": " **********MONDAY **********The annual Toy Fair opens in New York at the Jacob K.

Do you trust the union's leaders? Do you want somebody else speaking for you in dealings with your employer? Do you think you will be dismissed if you sign a union card -- or that the company will send your job overseas if a union is organized? **********But in one regard, the choice is simple -- and it is not the choice that most workers have made during the labor movement's recent decades in the economic wilderness. **********From a pocketbook perspective, workers are absolutely better off joining a union. Economists across the political spectrum agree: Turning a nonunion job into a union job very likely will have a bigger effect on lifetime finances than all the advice employees will ever read about investing their 401(k) plans, buying a home or otherwise making more of what they earn. **********Here is how the equation works, said Prof. Richard B. Freeman of Harvard University: ''For an existing worker in a firm, if you can carry out an organizing drive, it is all to your benefit. If there are going to be losers, they are people who might have gotten a job in the future, the shareholders whose profits will go down, the managers because there will be less profit to distribute to them in pay and, maybe, consumers will pay a little more for the product. But as a worker, it is awfully hard to see why you wouldn't want a union.'' **********Over all, union workers are paid about 20 percent more than nonunion workers, and their fringe benefits are typically worth two to four times as much, economists with a wide array of views have found. The financial advantage is even greater for workers with little formal education and training and for women, blacks and Hispanic workers. **********Moreover, 85 percent of union members have health insurance, compared with 57 percent of nonunion workers, said Barry Bluestone, a labor-friendly economics professor at the University of Massachusetts. **********The conclusion draws no argument even from Prof. Leo Troy of Rutgers University, who is widely known in academic circles and among union leaders for his hostility to organized labor. ''From a standpoint of wages and fringe benefits,'' Professor Troy said, ''the answer is yes, you are better off in a union.'' **********His objections to unions concern how they reduce profits for owners and distort investment decisions in ways that slow the overall growth of the economy -- not how they affect workers who bargain collectively.  Professor Troy points out that he belongs to a union himself -- the American Association of University Professors. **********Donald R. Deere, an economist at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A & M University, studied the wage differential for comparable union and nonunion workers between 1974 and 1996, a period when union membership fell to 15 percent of American workers from 22 percent. **********In every educational and age category that he studied, Professor Deere found that union members increased their wage advantage over nonunion workers during those years. Last year, he estimates, unionized workers with less than a high school education earned 22 percent more than their nonunion counterparts. The differential declined as education levels rose, reaching 10 percent for college graduates. **********''It makes sense to belong to a union,'' Professor Deere said, ''so long as you don't lose your job in the long term.'' **********SOME analysts go further, waving off the concern that paying union wages drives companies out of business and costs workers their jobs. In a study of 633 businesses, which employed 7.7 million workers, Professors Freeman and Morris M. Kleiner of the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota found that 126 of the enterprises became insolvent between 1983 and 1990. The failures were almost evenly split between union and nonunion workplaces. **********''People think that their risk in joining a union is that this stuff -- higher wages and more benefits -- will cost the company some money so there is some risk that you might lose your job,'' Professor Freeman said. ''That risk turns out to be pretty much zero. Is a company with a union more likely to go out of business? The answer is no.'' **********In other research, they found no significant differences in the rates at which unionized and nonunion manufacturers moved their operations overseas, Professor Kleiner said. Even so, many manufacturing jobs in the United States were lost in the 1980's as lower-cost foreign producers increased their sales in this country. **********But again, from the individual worker's perspective, belonging to a union may provide a buffer against the vicissitudes of global competition. **********''When the employer is on the edge and the union thinks the company can be saved,'' Professor Kleiner said, ''the unions will make concessions to keep the enterprise going. During the 1980's, there were huge givebacks, such as two-tier wage structures. Look at Northwest Airlines, where the unions gave huge wage concessions to keep the company going, and at Chrysler, which is now thriving again.'' **********Whatever economists may say, unions are no help to workers, said Jack D. Gulati, chief executive of Fidelity Technologies Group, a communications equipment maker in Reading, Pa., and himself a member of the elevator operators union in New York when he was a young man. **********''Employees, at least in manufacturing, who want to get ahead can't if there is a union,'' said Mr. Gulati, acting as a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business. The reason, he said, is that ''unions negotiate for rules that get more and more confining to define jobs and protect seniority. So if we had a union, someone who is good on the electronics assembly line can't try the mechanical assembly line, and people in maintenance can't advance to assembly.'' **********He said he did not think unions would succeed in expanding their membership,  except for ''opportunities created by abuses'' in which businesses mistreat employees. **********And Professor Troy said the findings by Professors Freeman and Kleiner might not tell the full story because unions ''tend to organize at the most financially successful companies, and those regulated by the government,'' rather than in highly competitive industries in which it takes very little capital and skill to start a new company, like retailing and light manufacturing. **********IN industries that cannot pick up and move (hotels, say, or asbestos removal) or where huge capital investments are required to enter the business (steel or automobiles), the premium wages and benefits negotiated by unions are like a tax on the owners' capital, said Barry Hirsch, an economist at Florida State University who studies income disparity. **********''The union captures in wages and benefits part of what would be profits and investment in research and development,'' he said. **********When such a ''tax'' is applied to some companies and not others, it can push the ones who pay it to the wall. That is one reason for a major shift in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s organizing tactics. Rather than trying to pick off one company at a time, the labor federation's new emphasis is on organizing an entire industry's workers in a city at once. **********That is what Local 78 of the Laborers Union did last year in the New York City asbestos removal business. **********Most workers in the industry are immigrants from Poland and Spain, many of whom do not speak English. Wages were typically $12 to $14 an hour with no benefits and no overtime, said Pawel Kedzior, the Polish immigrant who led the organizing drive. Several workers said that 12-hour shifts were common; workers often labored weeks at a time with no days off. **********After a work stoppage at the Exxon Building in Rockefeller Center in February 1996, the union won contracts with 40 companies. Both Mr. Kedzior and Salvatore J. DiLorenzo, president of the PAL Environmental Safety Corporation, said these companies handled the vast majority of asbestos removal in the city. **********The contract raised the pay of the 1,800 covered workers to $18 an hour plus benefits worth about $4 an hour. For the worst paid, that meant an 83 percent increase in compensation. The workers must pay $20 a month in union dues -- an expense that employees contemplating an organizing drive should figure into their calculations, experts say. **********''Now I can work 40 hours a week, not 60,'' one worker, Jan Pyziak of Brooklyn, said through an interpreter. **********''I don't have to work every weekend, and I can be with my two children more,'' said a co-worker, Joe Campo of Coram, N.Y. ''Now I only work weekends when I want. Having a union contract means a lot, especially having the medical insurance and the pension.'' **********The contractors say they can pass on the higher labor costs, provided that the union organizes the entire industry in New York. **********''There is no problem so long as every contractor is union, because then their bids are all based on the same costs,'' said Arthur Wolfman, a director of the Environmental Contractors Association. ''The problem is that not all contractors are union, and that screws things up.'' **********Nor are all unions equally effective. Unions exert the most influence when they have organized all or nearly all of an industry and when they have the capacity to shut down enterprises in a strike. Prof. Paula B. Voos of the University of Wisconsin estimated, for example, that supermarket workers in a metropolitan area could raise their wages by 2 percent for each additional 10 percentage points of the industry that was unionized. **********But unions are vulnerable to automation -- especially machinery that managers can readily operate during strikes -- and to running conflicts with other unions. **********And, of course, there is a real -- and immediate -- risk of losing one's job in deciding to become part of an organizing drive. **********Richard Bensinger, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s director of organizing, estimates that one in 20 workers who try to form a union are dismissed. And while such retaliation is not allowed, more than 13,000 workers complained to the National Labor Relations Board last year about illegal discharges. Most of the complaints are settled by negotiation. **********Professor Freeman said individuals considering whether to vote for a union in their workplace should examine the issue in the same way as an owner of capital would consider opening a factory or starting a production line. **********''Ask yourself: 'Is having a union a good investment for me?' Examined that way, there is a striking parallel to the capital investor,'' he said. ''The question is, 'Shall I invest, with lower risk but lower return, and therefore decide not to have a union? Or shall I take a bit of a gamble and hope that this union will be successful in winning me better wages, better benefits and more representation?' '' **********But do not count on the union putting the question to you in such terms. **********Both Mr. Bensinger and his boss, John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said success in organizing more workplaces would rely less on people's desire for higher wages and benefits than on their demand for a voice in the workplace. **********''I get rid of organizers who say 'I am here to get you $3 more an hour,' '' Mr. Bensinger said, ''because if you make that a single issue in organizing, the employers will just hand out big raises to beat the union.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/01/business/spanish-utility-buying-a-stake-in-brazil.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-08-01", "snippet": "Group led by Spanish utility Iberdrola SA wins bidding for controlling stake in Cia de Eletricidade do Estado de Bahia, or Coelba, which controls most of electricity market in one of Brazil's biggest states, Bahia; purchase of 65.64 percent stake ...", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spanish Utility Buying A Stake in Brazil", "print_headline": "Spanish Utility Buying A Stake in Brazil", "body_text": " **********A group led by the Spanish utility Iberdrola S.A. won the bidding yesterday for a controlling stake in Cia. de Eletricidade do Estado de Bahia, or Coelba, paying 1.73 billion reais ($1.6 billion), for a slice of Brazil's fast-growing energy market.

Beck, who rose from door-to-door selling to the top position at the Prudential Insurance Company of America, died yesterday at his home in Vero Beach, Fla. Mr. Beck, who also had a home in Rumson, N.J., was 71. **********The cause was cancer of the esophagus, his son, Stephen, who lives in Manhattan, said. **********In nine years as chairman and chief executive of the nation's largest insurance company, beginning in 1978, and as president for four years before that, Mr. Beck played a leading role in the expansion of Prudential's operations beyond its traditional life insurance base. **********He took the company into residential home sales and the credit card business and broadened its operations in group health insurance, homeowners' and auto insurance and reinsurance, which is sold to other insurance companies. He also directed the purchase in 1981 of the Bache Group Inc., parent of Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, then the nation's eighth-largest brokerage firm, now known as Prudential Securities. **********Mr. Beck shifted much of Prudential's corporate authority to its headquarters in Newark and vicinity and away from the company's regional offices. All the while, he was a relentless cheerleader for the Prudential salespeople, who looked to him as one of their own. **********In the early 1990's, the company was staggered by a scandal in Prudential Securities and, later, by lawsuits contending that for 13 years, beginning in 1982, during Mr. Beck's tenure, the company had been enticing life insurance customers to replace old policies with new ones -- a practice called churning -- in which the main beneficiaries were Prudential and its agents. **********Prudential Securities was accused of misleading clients, many of them elderly and with modest nest eggs, selling them investments in high-risk, limited partnerships; it eventually paid $1.5 billion in fines, compensation and legal fees. In a settlement on the insurance case, Prudential agreed to pay at least $410 million in compensation to policyholders, and some analysts say the cost could go as high as $2 billion. **********In the insurance complaints, Prudential was not alone. Scores of life insurance companies have been sued, accused of misleading customers in the 1980's and early 1990's. Executives who worked with Mr. Beck contend the troubles in the securities and insurance operations were unlikely events to have taken place on his watch. **********''Bob was a stickler for integrity and credibility,'' said David J. Sherwood, who served as president and the No. 2 executive of Prudential during six of Mr. Beck's years as head of the company. ''He was very strong on the training of the agency force and in the concept of meeting the customer's needs rather than pushing products.'' **********In 1994, as Prudential was reporting heavy losses, Arthur F. Ryan was recruited from the Chase Manhattan Bank to revive the company. Among the most problem-ridden units were those dealing with health insurance and home and auto insurance. Narrowing Prudential's focus to concentrate on life insurance and money management, Mr. Ryan shut down the credit card business and sold the reinsurance business. And he has set out to tighten central control, years after Mr. Beck began trying to rein in the sprawling company. **********When Mr. Beck stepped aside in 1987 to become a member of Prudential's board, he astounded some of his fellow executives by returning to his first love, selling insurance. **********The second time around, however, he was not knocking on the doors of strangers but calling on executives he had met during his 36 years with Prudential and as a leader of such civic and professional organizations as the United Way of America and the Business Roundtable and as a member of Presidential commissions and committees during the Reagan Administration. The policies he sold ran into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, sometimes even more than a million, and he soon won a spot in Prudential's President's Club for its most productive agents. **********''He wanted to set an example, showing Prudential agents that insurance sales was something to aspire to, not to escape from,'' said Mr. Beck's eldest son, Robert 2d, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla. ''I think he also wanted to show them he remembered how.'' **********Mr. Beck was born in the Morris Heights section of the Bronx on Oct. 6, 1925, the son of Alma Wickware Beck, a supervisor of telephone operators, and Arthur C. Beck, a career Army officer who had won a battlefield promotion in World War I. He graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1942 at the age of 16 and marked time for two years as an audit clerk at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in Manhattan until he was old enough to enlist in the Army. **********After basic training, parachute school and officers' candidate school, Mr. Beck was sent to southern Germany as a part of the Allied occupation force in 1945. **********His fascination with insurance sales began when he returned to the United States and was posted at Fort Bragg, N.C. One of his duties was to serve as the insurance officer for the 82d Airborne Division, trying to sign up fellow soldiers for low-cost life insurance policies offered by the military. One of his customers was William Westmoreland, the division's executive officer who later commanded American forces in Vietnam. **********At Fort Bragg, First Lieutenant Beck met a representative of Prudential, who wrote a letter to the company's headquarters in Newark recommending him for a sales job. Mr. Beck worked as a part-time agent while studying marketing and management at Syracuse University. When he graduated, Prudential had no openings, so he took a job in the finance division at the Ford Motor Company under Robert S. McNamara, who became Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy Administration. But within a year, Mr. Beck went back to Prudential as a full-time sales agent. **********Besides Robert and Stephen, Mr. Beck is survived by his wife, the former Frances Kenny, another son, Arthur, of Delray Beach, Fla.; two daughters, Sister Kathleen Beck of Dallas and Teresa Koenig of Columbia, S.C., five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. **********After 43 parachute jumps in the Army, Mr. Beck never again leaped out of an airplane. But, as president of Prudential, in his late 40's and early 50's, Mr. Beck took up hang-gliding and white-water rafting. He gave up those sports at the behest of Prudential actuaries, and he agreed to limit one of his other passions, scuba diving, to moderate depths. **********He made a flourish of his daring sports, Stephen Beck said, because ''he didn't want people to think insurance people were boring or staid.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/10/business/stares-of-lawyerly-disbelief-at-a-huge-civil-award.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-09-10", "snippet": "Analysis of nearly $3.5 billion punitive-damages assessment against CSX Transportation Inc in 1987 Louisiana railway fire; holds advocates of tort reform say case is prime example of need to limit or abolish punitive damages and to discourage fili...", "word_count": 1105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stares of Lawyerly Disbelief at a Huge Civil Award", "print_headline": "Stares of Lawyerly Disbelief at a Huge Civil Award", "body_text": " **********Big civil-damages awards have become an increasingly common feature of the American legal landscape, but Monday's nearly $3.5 billion punitive-damages assessment in a 1987 Louisiana railway fire is being seen as a case unto itself. **********The accident that spawned the huge award was little noticed outside Louisiana and did not cause widespread injury or death. Questions were raised about the long-term health effects of the chemical fire, but no definitive studies have established lasting medical damage. **********The award has left legal experts shaking their heads. Advocates of tort reform say the case is a prime example of the need to limit or abolish punitive damages and to discourage the filing of class-action claims. **********Many of the case's specifics remained unclear today, including the potential for latent damage to the health of thousands of residents of the neighborhood near the fire and the culpability of the companies that shared blame for the accident. **********The size of the verdict may be partly explained by the residents' anger at the storage of highly flammable and toxic chemicals in rail cars in their poor, largely black neighborhood where citizens have little money or political influence. Lawyers for the residents said they were victims of ''environmental racism.'' **********Still, the $3.5 billion judgment, representing seven times the ultimate payout in 1989 from the lethal chemical explosion at Bhopal, India, stunned participants and independent analysts alike. To be sure, India originally sought $3 billion in compensation for more than 3,000 deaths. **********Brent Barriere, one of a team of lawyers defending the five transportation companies in the case, called the verdict outrageous and said it was the result of a jury's riding a ''runaway train.'' **********He said that the award bore no relationship to the actual damages borne by the 8,000 people temporarily evacuated from their homes 10 years ago when a tank car containing butadiene, a volatile chemical used to make synthetic rubber, began to leak and then burst into flames in a New Orleans rail yard. **********He noted that an earlier Federal court suit against the same companies, stemming from the same accident, had awarded several plaintiffs an average of $500 in compensatory damages. ''At most, they suffered 36 hours of inconvenience,'' Mr. Barriere said. ''These numbers are a stunning abuse of the system.'' **********Referring to the railway companies, Wendell Gauthier, a New Orleans lawyer representing many of the class-action plaintiffs, asserted: ''These scoundrels, they took the position that there's nobody back there worth caring about, they're all black, they're all poor and nobody cares about them. If it was your family out there, would you feel the verdict was outrageous?'' **********To be sure, huge damage awards are frequently reduced by judges or reversed on appeal. Legal experts predicted that this would happen in this case, as well. **********A Federal jury in 1994 ordered Exxon to pay $5 billion in damages to 34,000 fishermen and other Alaskans who said they had been harmed by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Exxon is appealing the judgment. Union Carbide settled with the Indian Government for damages of $470 million for the chemical disaster. **********And the McDonald's hot-coffee case -- in which a jury awarded a woman scalded by a cup of carryout coffee $2.7 million in punitive damages, later reduced to $640,000 -- established a pattern of corporate disregard for the potential dangers of its product. **********But in the Louisiana rail-car accident, the jury appears to have been motivated chiefly by urgings from plaintiffs' lawyers to ''send a message'' to the corporate defendants, rather than by a damage analysis. **********Mr. Gauthier argued in court that the companies had been ''careless and indifferent'' to the people living near the rail yard. He said in an interview that the residents sustained mental anguish, financial costs and physical pain as a result of the evacuation. **********Kimbra Whitney, one of the jurors, told reporters on Monday that she had been persuaded by Mr. Gauthier's argument that the companies did not show adequate regard for the safety and comfort of residents. **********''I felt the evidence showed they were unconcerned,'' she said. **********But lawyers who try to defend corporations and individuals against civil-damage suits said that such juries set an impossible standard for behavior. It is not enough, they said, to follow the law and exercise reasonable care; companies must show proper ''concern'' for potential victims of their actions. **********''This case shows that our system has turned into the world's richest roulette wheel,'' said Victor E. Schwartz, a Washington liability lawyer specializing in defending corporations. ''Even if this judgment is lowered, it creates more litigation and more unreasonable settlements. There should be some limits based on conduct for how much is too much,'' he continued, to avoid ''very bad consequences for our society.'' **********On the other hand, Marc Galanter, director of the Institute for Legal Studies at the University of Wisconsin, called the case interesting but not particularly significant. ''Verdicts like this are very rare, and it's undoubtedly going to be reduced to a few million dollars by the judge,'' he said. ''I don't think it really changes the overall picture of the system.'' **********Monday's award appeared to assess penalties based on the depth of each company's pockets rather than on its share of responsibility for the accident, according to Marshall S. Shapo, a professor at the Northwestern University School of Law. **********The National Transportation Safety Board found that CSX Transportation, a unit of the CSX Corporation, was not responsible for the leak that caused the chemical fire, but the jury nonetheless found the corporation liable because it owned the tracks on which the accident occurred. **********CSX, the largest company involved, was assessed $2.5 billion in punitive damages. Nearly $1 billion more in punitive damages was levied against Mitsui & Company, the shipper of the chemical; GATX Terminals, a GATX Corporation unit, which loaded the car, and the other railroads that handled the car -- Illinois Central and Alabama Great Southern, part of the Norfolk Southern Corporation. **********''This award is particularly puzzling if the jury agreed with the N.T.S.B. that CSX didn't cause the accident,'' Mr. Shapo said. ''I can only surmise that the jury thought that they did in some way contribute to the accident. I guess this is understandable as a desire to express outrage and to punish.'' **********Although the Louisiana Legislature passed a law last year that all but eliminates punitive damages in civil suits as part of a broader tort-law revision package, this case was filed years before that law took effect, and thus was not subject to it. **********Ron Gomez, a former state lawmaker who advocated abolition of punitive damages and who now heads a group called Louisiana Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse, said that Monday's verdict showed that the civil-law system was ''totally out of control.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/01/business/2-struggling-banks-to-merge-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-04-01", "snippet": "Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, one of Japan's leading commercial banks, plans to buy rival Hokkaido Bank, which has market value of 6 billion yen ($496 million) (S)", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Struggling Banks To Merge in Japan", "print_headline": "2 Struggling Banks To Merge in Japan", "body_text": " **********The Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, one of Japan's leading commercial banks, plans to buy the rival Hokkaido Bank, which has a market value of 61 billion yen ($496 million), the Finance Ministry said today.

But they said it was buying a solid business in markets with opportunities for cost savings and profit in taking over responsibility for sick elderly patients of health maintenance organizations. **********The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, would create a new company, the Genesis Eldercare Acquisition Corporation. Genesis Health and the investor groups are offering $28 for each share of Multicare, which is based in Hackensack, N.J. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Multicare stock rose $1.25, to $26.875. Genesis Health Ventures rose 25 cents, to $35.375. **********Multicare was started in 1984 by two young lawyers, Daniel E. Straus, who is now 40, and his brother Moshael J. Straus, 44, with four nursing homes they inherited from their father, Joseph. They took the company public in 1993 at $10 a share and later split the stock, 3 for 2, making its adjusted original cost $6.67. **********''We made a lot of money for a lot of people,'' Daniel Straus said yesterday. The Straus family will get about $455 million for their 43 percent stake in Multicare. **********Genesis Health Ventures will pay $300 million and will get a 42 percent stake in the new company. The investors -- the Cypress Group of New York, which includes James A. Stern and three former colleagues in a buyout unit at Lehman Brothers, and the Texas Pacific Group -- will pay $420 million and will get the other  58 percent. There will also be $675 million in senior debt financing, and the new company will assume $342 million of Multicare's debt. **********The Texas Pacific Group, based in San Francisco and Fort Worth, is a sponsor of TPG Partners II L.P., a $2.5 billion partnership specializing in corporate acquisitions. **********Michael R. Walker, chairman and chief executive of Genesis, said the deal would enhance his ''strategic mission'' -- to provide a full range of health care services for the elderly on the East Coast. Genesis has 17,000 nursing home beds; Multicare has 15,000 plus 1,000 in assisted living residences for people who need less care. **********The combined company would also provide day care centers, rehabilitation after strokes and accidents, home health care and prescription drugs for nursing home patients. **********Mr. Walker said Multicare was the dominant provider in Boston and three New Jersey counties, Bergen, Morris and Essex, where it has 13 nursing homes. It has 20 percent of the market in West Virginia. **********Mr. Walker is negotiating with Blue Cross plans and other managed care companies, offering discounts and case management for elderly patients with chronic conditions like depression or memory loss. **********He said the object was to keep them ''independent and outside a nursing home.'' In the fall, he said, Genesis will also start selling advice, supervision and referrals to appropriate services to people taking care of elderly parents or spouses. **********Peter J. Sidoti, a health care analyst with NatWest Securities, said Multicare was ''a jewel in the nursing home business, in quality of care and quality of management measured by earnings growth and stock price appreciation.'' **********The selling price was ''at the top end of the range,'' compared with similar recent big mergers, Mr. Walker said. The deal was valued at 13.4 times Multicare's 1996 cash flow of $104 million, defined as earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization. That compares with a factor of 8.7 in another recent nursing home deal, Living Centers of America's $1.8 billion merger with Grancare Inc. last month, and 9.8 in the acquisition of Theratx Inc. by Vencor Inc. for $354 million in February, Daniel Straus said. **********Projected 1997 cash flow for Multicare, based on the first three months, was $115 million, bringing the purchase multiple to 12.1, he added. **********Margo Vignola, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said Genesis, which is based in Kennett Square, Pa., had been effective in catering to the desire of the elderly to stay out of nursing homes. It was ''the first nursing home company to recognize that it could do better if it did not keep people in a bed,'' she said. **********Mr. Walker said Medicaid patients accounted for 60 percent of the Genesis ''population,'' low-income people for whom ''we don't get paid an adequate amount,'' he said. **********By contrast, Multicare gets about 32 percent of its payments from Medicaid and 42 percent from patients who pay out of pocket, Mr. Straus said. Most of the rest are financed by long-term-care insurance or Medicare, the Federal program for the elderly and disabled, which provides limited coverage. He said charges in the company's 155 homes averaged $160 a day. **********Daniel Straus said Medicaid was ''becoming less prominent'' in the mix of nursing home patients because of pressure from managed care companies that push patients out of hospitals before they are well enough to go home. Nursing homes can then give such patients post-acute care, which is more lucrative than simply providing custodial care, much of it financed by Medicaid, for patients with limited needs. **********Bank financing for the deal will be provided by the Mellon Bank, Nationsbank, First Union and Citibank.

This year some 200,000, including many of the 320,000 Bosnians who took refuge in Germany and are now being deported from there, are expected to arrive. **********Of the returning refugees, at least 60 percent are Muslims from the Serbian enclave in Bosnia, according to United Nations officials, and most of those are sent here. Thousands more who can go back to their villages in territory held by the Bosnian Government had their homes destroyed in the war. **********The Bosnian Serbs, who carried out widespread ethnic cleansing against the Muslims in the war, killing tens of thousands of civilians as they drove them from their villages and homes, have failed to comply with nearly every aspect of the Bosnian peace agreement that was negotiated in Dayton, Ohio. **********The Serbs, for example, do not let Muslims return to their homes in Bosnian Serb territory, and they also refuse to cooperate with the joint institutions formed under the peace agreement to create a unified Bosnia. **********The Bosnian Muslims are surrounded by hostile neighbors, with just 30 percent of Bosnia under their control. The Bosnian Serbs hold about half the country, and the Bosnian Croats control about 20 percent of Bosnian territory and take their orders from Croatia. The Muslims, on their own, do not have enough territory to build a politically or economically viable state. **********A military push on Serbian-held Bosnia is, for the Muslim leadership, a matter of survival, many Western diplomats say. **********Muslim officials say the 800,000 Muslims who moved abroad during the war should all return to help build the new, unified Bosnian state. They say they are placing returning Muslim refugees, whose homes are in the Serbian enclave, in Sanski Most because the town is the closest to their old villages. **********Although a third of its housing was destroyed in the war, Sanski Most has already mushroomed to its prewar size of 70,000 people, although only 20,000 of the people here live in their own homes. **********City officials daily move stunned and exhausted families into homes of complete strangers -- usually other refugees -- with predictable resulting tensions. Most of the standing homes in the city are Serbian dwellings that were abandoned when the Bosnian Muslim and Croatian armies captured Sanski Most in October 1995 during the closing days of the war. Under the peace agreement the homes remain Serbian property. **********Many Western diplomats worry that a military push by the Muslims against the Serbian enclave is being contemplated by Sarajevo if the NATO-led peacekeeping force withdraws as planned next year. The plight of thousands of poor Bosnians, crammed into Sanski Most, would give Sarajevo the political justification for such an attack, they say. And the refugees would, by that point, be more than ready to accept the risk of returning to their old homes. **********The Serbian enclave begins about two miles from the city line. The demarcation point is marked by gutted houses, roped-off mine fields and a stretch of road that turns from pitted asphalt to dirt. **********Few Muslims dare venture to the other side. The handful of people who have crossed the line to visit their old homes, and who were detected, were badly beaten by Serbs. A few weeks ago, two men who had returned from Sweden were found looking around their old neighborhood by some Serbs and attacked. The property being inspected by the men, turned over to Serbs, was then destroyed by a mob. **********''Politics have failed to get people back to their homes in places still held by the Chetniks,'' said Muhamed Terzic, a 34-year-old Bosnian Army soldier, using a term for Serbs. ''It's time to let us in the army get rid of the Chetniks and solve this problem.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/12/your-money/IHT-what-will-emu-mean-for-bond-investors.html": {"writer_name": "Conrad De Aenlle", "pub_date": "1997-07-12", "snippet": "FOR MONTHS now, European bond traders have put so much faith in the ability of their political leaders to forge an economic and monetary union that they have treated many of the continent's weak economies as if they will indeed reform themselves t...", "word_count": 7212, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Your Money", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "What Will EMU Mean for Bond Investors?", "print_headline": "What Will EMU Mean for Bond Investors?", "body_text": " **********FOR MONTHS now, European bond traders have put so much faith in the ability of their political leaders to forge an economic and monetary union that they have treated many of the continent's weak economies as if they will indeed reform themselves to confirm with the strict criteria laid out in the Maastricht treaty. **********What this means is that yields on bonds from countries such as Spain and Italy are not much higher than the returns on German bunds, the bellwether for the European market. Traditionally, Germany ran a tight fiscal ship, keeping the Deutsche mark strong even at the cost of job creation, while its more profligate neighbors would seek to spend their ways out of bad times and boost their exports by allowing their currencies to fall, creating inflationary pressures in their domestic markets that sapped the value of their bonds. **********Yet the outlook for the monetary union, which would see creation of the euro in place of national currencies, is unclear. Based on current situations, only three of the European Union's 15 members are likely to meet all of the criteria for joining. None of this trio \u2014 Luxembourg, the smallest EU country; Britain, traditionally wary of European integration, and Finland, a recent arrival \u2014 are considered vital to the project's success. **********Of the two countries at the core of the union plans, Germany will have to make a determined effort to meet the criteria, while France seems unlikely to pare its budget deficit even close to the required 3.0 percent of gross domestic product. With both countries plagued by high unemployment rates and France's newly elected Socialist government having made campaign vows to alleviate joblessness, the odds against a Maastricht-like currency union coming into force by 1999 are lengthening. **********This raises questions for fixed-income investors, with three scenarios: **********The union goes ahead as planned and more or less on time. **********The convergence criteria are relaxed, allowing the union to proceed for political reasons but with less-sound economic underpinnings than planned. **********The union is postponed significantly or canceled. **********Each scenario would require a different response from investors, but some analysts think the best idea would be to avoid the market entirely and opt for short-term U.S. Treasury issues, where the two-year note now offers a 5.86 percent return in the resurgent dollar. The British market, separated physically and otherwise from mainland Europe, would be an alternative strong-currency play, with 10-year gilts yielding 7.02 percent. **********Many investors feel they must have exposure to the European markets, where yields still reflect the first scenario. The shrinking of spreads between weaker borrowers and Germany has accelerated in recent weeks. In mid-May, Italian 10-year government bonds yielded as much as 1.6 percentage points more than bunds. They are currently trading with a spread of less than one point, with Italian issues at 6.45 percent and bunds returning 5.54 percent. **********The premium of bonds issued in Spain has narrowed over the same span from 1.1 points to a sliver over 0.6 point. At 6.18 percent, their yields are slightly lower than those of 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, while the yield on Portuguese bonds is just 6.21 percent, roughly equivalent to the comparable U.S. maturity. **********In a sane world, would yields on Italian bonds be only a few ticks higher than U.S. Treasury yields of the same maturity, and would traders demand a premium to hold Treasuries instead of Spanish bonds? **********\"Spain and Italy have made some staggering transformations, but I have to admit it looks odd, especially to a U.S. investor,\" said Steven Bell, chief economist in London for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. In a long run, he said, the dollar looks stronger than the peseta. **********\"In that context, Treasuries look very cheap,\" he said. \"If I had to buy an asset and couldn't sell it for 10 years, I'd probably rather buy Treasuries than Spanish bonds. But I don't buy and hold these things 10 years. I'm just looking at the near-term prospects. Growth in the U.S. is looking strong, there's no slack in the economy. U.S. interest rates are going to go up. In Europe there's no inflation and no growth.\" **********Besides, he pointed out, \"the argument that says get out of Spain and Italy and get into Treasuries would have had you lose money in the last year or so.\" **********He does not find it a good argument now, either. Morgan Grenfell forecast earlier this week that spreads over bunds are likely to continue to fall, to 0.6 percentage point for Italian bonds and 0.4 point for Spanish bonds. That view is based on two assumptions, widely shared in the bond market: that EMU will go ahead and it will include those countries, as in the second scenario. **********Credit Suisse First Boston also expects an ecumenical system, including all the southern countries except Greece. It expects the start, planned for Jan. 1, 1999, to be delayed up to a year, but considers Italy \"still the ultimate convergence play.\" **********Its analysts also recommend debt from Spain and Ireland, as well as the fiscally prudent malcontents \u2014 Britain and Sweden, which are unlikely to join EMU at the start, and Norway, which said no to the European Union altogether. **********Yet if the currency union falls apart, it is bonds from Germany and the other core countries whose economies are linked to it, such as Austria and Denmark, that are seen as the best bets, along with British and Swedish issues. A failure of the union would punish the currencies of many of the noncore countries, which might also be tempted to deal with their weak economies by inflationary spending programs. **********Some analysts see little money in EMU, now that bond yields and foreign-exchange rates have narrowed so much. **********\"I don't expect a complete crash in the euro,\" said Kim Schoenholtz, chief economist for Salomon Brothers Inc., \"but European currencies could fall a further 10 percent\" against the dollar if there are hitches in implementing EMU. **********\"It's a very one-sided bet,\" said Roger Monson, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. Europe. \"If everything works, you keep what you got; if it doesn't, you lose quite a bit. I wouldn't want to go to a roulette wheel with those odds.\" **********Richard Davidson, Morgan Stanley's European strategist, thinks uncertainty will remain, even if EMU becomes a certainty. \"It does not mean that Europe will necessarily live happily ever after; far from it,\" he warned. \"The broad single-currency group that is forming carries many inherent risks to the viability of the system.\" **********\"Labor markets, savings rates, tax rates, levels of home ownership and interest-rate structures all remain substantially different,\" he added. \"All of these will distort further the effects of a common European central bank interest-rate policy on different economies. Initially that distortion is likely to be felt through weakness of the euro, but eventually, given the protest vote that is already building in Europe, it could lead to a splintering of the system.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/07/business/for-brokerage-houses-a-new-class-of-suitor-rides-in.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Truell", "pub_date": "1997-03-07", "snippet": "Many Wall Street firms are worried about threat of takeover from banking, insurance and other outside institutions; merger agreement between Dean Witter, Discover and Morgan Stanley Group kicked off wave of speculation about other potential Wall S...", "word_count": 1852, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Brokerage Houses, a New Class of Suitor Rides In", "print_headline": "For Brokerage Houses, a New Class of Suitor Rides In", "body_text": " **********When executives from Citicorp and American Express met secretly late last year to discuss merging their businesses, it sent a strong message to the investment bankers at Morgan Stanley that the financial world's heavies were about to descend on Wall Street. **********Citicorp, which was advised by Morgan Stanley in its exploratory discussions with the American Express Company, pulled back from the deal, at least for the moment. But even though those merger discussions did not go anywhere, executives say, they spurred Morgan Stanley Group and Dean Witter, Discover & Company to move quickly to forge their own $10.5 billion merger, which they announced last month. The two are not alone. Rather than leave themselves vulnerable to the big American and foreign banks on the prowl or one of the large corporations that want a piece of the action, a number of Wall Street firms are circling the wagons, too. **********Paine Webber has stepped up its search for an asset management firm, in part because size may help it evade some hungry predator. Salomon Brothers signed an innovative marketing deal with Fidelity Investments, the FMR unit, intended to broaden its equity franchise through better access to private investors. Most Wall Street firms are also zealously encouraging their employees to buy their own shares, hoping that a lot of insider ownership will increase employee motivation and also give their firms more protection from unwanted would-be acquirers on the prowl. And some executives at Dean Witter and Morgan Stanley are still jumpy, fearing that another party, perhaps even American Express, might try to derail the union with a more lucrative offer. **********If Wall Streeters are going to make any deals for their own firms, says Richard K. Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company who covers the brokerage industry, their first choice is one of their own. ''These targets,'' he said, ''would much more prefer to be matched up with a like company in a like culture.'' **********There also is a palpable concern about the damage that unwanted gunslingers from outside the tight-knit world of Wall Street may do if they come blundering into the securities business. **********''The history of acquisitions in the brokerage industry by outsiders has been so bad,'' said Regina Dolan, Paine Webber's chief financial officer. The General Electric Company, for example, had an awful experience with Kidder, Peabody & Company, the Wall Street firm it sold to Paine Webber in late 1994. **********As the barriers that once kept banks, insurance and the brokerage business apart crumble, the bankers and insurers are riding into town. the BankAmerica Corporation, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the Nationsbank Corporation, American Insurance Group, Travelers Group and foreign behemoths like Dresdner Bank, the Swiss Bank Corporation and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, a unit of HSBC Holdings, are already scouting around. **********Their prime targets are likely to be attractive smaller firms on Wall Street. Among them are Alex. Brown & Sons; Bear, Stearns & Company; Oppenheimer Group; Legg Mason Inc. and Lehman Brothers. **********But other firms could also fall victim, including some that already have ties to outsiders. These include Prudential Securities, Salomon Brothers and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. At the very least, big financial institutions want to cherry-pick Wall Street's best talent to build up their own investment banking and brokerage operations. **********Some past Wall Street alliances have not worked well, leaving a cautionary legacy for those now contemplating defensive maneuvers. Shearson-Lehman, a brokerage combination tried by American Express fell short of expectations and ended with Lehman being spun off in 1993 and Shearson being acquired by Travelers. **********But while ''there won't be an avalanche'' of mergers and acquisitions on Wall Street, says Milton R. Berlinski, a partner at Goldman, Sachs who advises big financial firms, he sees another round of deals -- perhaps half a dozen in the next year or two -- as all but inevitable. Several are likely to be mergers aimed, in part, at building up enough critical mass to avoid unwanted takeovers. **********What has made Wall Street particularly vulnerable to commercial banks that are eager to expand their reach is that the Federal Reserve has relaxed its rules governing what they can own. Banks can now own securities operations that account for up to 25 percent of their revenues, up from 10 percent last year. **********For the first time since the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act separated the banking and securities businesses, big banks can, in theory, buy virtually all but the largest Wall Street brokerage houses. Some banks, eager to recapture a portion of the funds that have leaked from low-interest savings accounts into more attractive mutual funds and brokerage accounts, would clearly like to. **********At Chase Manhattan, for example, a recent management shuffle gave James B. Lee Jr. and Donald H. Layton joint responsibility for running its investment bank. That left William B. Harrison Jr., a vice chairman and director, free to focus on potential acquisitions in the brokerage business, executives at that bank say. In some crystal ball gazing research published last month, Dean P. Eberling, an analyst at Prudential Securities, speculated that Chase might eventually acquire the merged Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter. **********In recent months, Chase has also hired several senior executives from Salomon, including Mark C. Davis, a takeover specialist, and John P. Lipsky, who is now Chase's chief economist. From Donaldson, Lufkin, the bank also picked up Wilfred A. Finnegan, who heads Chase's high-yield bond business, and from Furman, Selz, John Steinhardt, who leads its American securities business. **********This kind of interest in the brokerage business has investors hopping. The share price of Donaldson, Lufkin, for example, rose more than 7 percent on Feb. 10 on speculation that it might be sold. The firm, which is 73 percent owned by the Equitable Companies and Axa, its French parent, said it was happy with its current ownership. **********''I think people are rotating among the securities stocks,'' said Sam G. Liss, a managing director and analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, ''trying to speculate about where the action is coming next.'' **********Many potential takeover targets, though, remain deeply suspicious of the outsiders that are eying them so covetously. Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive of Paine Webber, cautioned in an interview that Wall Street is a business that is largely foreign to commercial banks. Compensation in the securities business, he said, is higher and much more erratic. And talented traders, brokers and investment bankers, by far the most valuable asset in most brokerage firms, can readily walk out the door and find jobs elsewhere if they are unhappy. **********Something like that happened, for instance, after Credit Suisse began acquiring First Boston in the late 1980's. Its record is at best mixed, as the firm has been beset by defections and considerable in-fighting. **********Everyone involved is aware that several past commercial banking forays into the securities business have failed miserably. When Britain deregulated its securities industry in 1986, American banking companies like Chase and Citicorp ambitiously gobbled up local firms, buying some of the best-known names in the London brokerage business. **********Citicorp acquired both Scrimgeour Kemp Gee and Vickers da Costa, two established London brokerage houses, which it combined in hopes of bringing together a strong corporate finance business with an envied Asian equities franchise. But much of the talent was offended at Citicorp's commercial banking culture and its rough attempts to build an international securities business virtually overnight. Several longtime employees of Vickers da Costa later gathered to establish Peregrine, an investment bank based in Hong Kong. **********Some foreign banks, now trying to build investment banks of their own on Wall Street, are already discovering just how protean Wall Street can be. Deutsche Bank A.G., the German banking giant, for example, has been trying to construct an investment bank in the Morgan Stanley mold, hiring whole teams of bankers from that firm, as well as from Merrill Lynch & Company and Goldman, Sachs. As soon as Deutsche Bank had spent billions on the project, Morgan Stanley itself started to metamorphose, first by buying the Van Kampen/American Capital mutual fund family, then by merging with Dean Witter. **********In this fast-changing milieu, it is not clear which strategies are likely to prove most successful. But Wall Street firms like Salomon and Donaldson, Lufkin, which deal mostly with institutional customers, are clearly interested in building better access to the private investor. That strategy was advanced by some influential recent research from Sallie L. Krawcheck, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, showing the profit margins in traditional investment banking and securities trading businesses are declining, while returns on the dwindling number of Main Street businesses with nationwide branch networks remained strong. **********''The institutional firms are walking around playing musical chairs, eyeing the chairs carefully, so if the music stops there'll be a chair for them,'' said Paul V. Scura, the head of investment banking at Prudential Securities. **********The brokerage firms may not have a lot of time to make their choices. Their potential suitors at the big banks and insurance companies have fat wallets these days, and some are prepared to dip deeply into their capital to offer prices that may be hard to refuse. And if the stock market drops significantly, pulling down the market values of securities firms, that could be just the opening many banks are waiting for. **********Even the biggest firms on Wall Street could be vulnerable. Merrill Lynch, the largest American brokerage firm in terms of capital until the Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter deal is completed and still the firm with the most extensive branch network and the broadest business, has about $16 billion in market capital. That is not much compared with Chase's $46 billion or the $58 billion at American Insurance Group, which has reportedly been sniffing around Merrill Lynch. **********David K. Schafer, president of Schafer & Cullen, a New York investment adviser and mutual fund company, argues that the recent Morgan Stanley-Dean Witter merger ''may be the trigger to a number of other moves.'' Mr. Schafer, whose funds have invested in Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Paine Webber, says that for bigger Wall Street firms, like Merrill and Goldman, Sachs, it is now a matter of ''keeping up with the Morgan Stanleys.'' **********Even Goldman, the only major private partnership and perhaps the most prized jewel in the Wall Street crown, may have to act. It lacks the Main Street distribution that Merrill has had for decades and that Morgan is about to obtain. Goldman's leaders, who declined to comment publicly on the matter, agreed privately that they might have to change but said no immediate decisions were necessary. **********As for Merrill, it maintains that it has already built the Wall Street model for the 21st century, in part through its successful acquisitions years ago of White Weld and A. G. Becker. But many analysts expect that David H. Komanksy, its new chief executive, will want to make a big acquisition to secure once again his firm's claim to being No. 1 in the American and overseas securities business. **********Mr. Komansky, of course, is mum about his specific plans. But he said that Merrill's ''strategy is to be the leading financial management and advisory company for a broadly diverse global client base.'' **********That will be achieved, he added, through ''superior service, internal expansion and selective acquisitions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/27/business/greenspan-warns-again-that-stocks-may-be-too-high.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1997-02-27", "snippet": "Federal Reserve Chmn Alan Greenspan tells Senate Banking Committee that stock prices might be unsustainably high; he suggests that despite economy's basic health, time might be drawing near when central bank will have to raise interest rates to he...", "word_count": 1180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GREENSPAN WARNS AGAIN THAT STOCKS MAY BE TOO HIGH", "print_headline": "GREENSPAN WARNS AGAIN THAT STOCKS MAY BE TOO HIGH", "body_text": " **********Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, bluntly warned investors today that stock prices might be unsustainably high. And he suggested that despite the economy's basic health, the time might be drawing near when the central bank would have to raise interest rates to head off inflation. **********In his most extensive public statement to date about the risks from the rapid run-up in stock prices, Mr. Greenspan said it was not surprising given the nation's general prosperity in recent years that people had grown complacent about the economic and investment outlook. Against such a backdrop, he said, many people seem to believe that businesses and financial markets have entered a new era of low risk. **********''But, regrettably, history is strewn with visions of such 'new eras' that in the end have proven to be a mirage,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''In short, history counsels caution. Such caution seems especially warranted with regard to the sharp rise in equity prices during the past two years. These gains have obviously raised questions of sustainability.'' **********Mr. Greenspan's remarks, made to the Senate Banking Committee in his twice-a-year testimony to Congress on monetary policy, helped send the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 122 points at one point, although prices rebounded substantially by the end of the day. The Dow closed at 6,983.15, down 55.03 points. Bond prices also fell sharply, pushing interest rates higher as traders reacted to the possibility of a more restrictive monetary policy. $(News analysis, page D1.$) **********Mr. Greenspan also rattled the markets by reminding investors that to maintain stable growth the Federal Reserve must sometimes raise interest rates before any clear signs of accelerating inflation show up in the economy. **********The Federal Reserve last changed interest rate policy 13 months ago, when it trimmed the most important official rate, the Federal funds target rate, by a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent. Since then, the economy, now completing its sixth year of expansion, has continued to advance but  inflation has remained quiescent. **********Economists said that there was still no clear case for the Fed to raise rates at its next policy-making meeting on March 25 but that a rate increase later this year remained a strong possibility. **********Several analysts concluded that Mr. Greenspan was preparing the markets for an interest rate increase in coming months and was going out of his way to take some steam out of the stock market now so that any rate increase would not cause the market to plunge when it comes. **********''Either Greenspan would have had to capitulate to the new paradigm view that inflation was dead, '' said Stephen S. Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, ''or he would have to do the noble thing that every disciplined central banker does in the latter stages of a business cycle expansion, which is to pave the way for a monetary policy tightening. **********''He opted to demonstrate that the Fed is very much alive and disciplined as a central bank, and he set in motion the process that will culminate in a fairly significant monetary policy tightening in 1997. He is fully aware that these are exuberant and highly leveraged financial markets, and that if he moves too quickly the damage could be substantial.'' **********Mr. Greenspan's comments came at a time of widespread debate over whether the huge inflows of new money into the stock market, especially from individuals investing in retirement plans or putting more of their savings in mutual funds, have fundamentally changed the way equities should be valued. Analysts are also wondering how the hordes of relatively inexperienced investors will respond if the long bull market suddenly turns down sharply. **********Other economists are less certain than Mr. Roach that the Fed will raise rates anytime soon. Indeed, the division of opinion among economists reflects the paradox for policy makers that Mr. Greenspan detailed in his testimony today: There are early warning signs of rising inflation, particularly increasing wage rates, beginning to flash yellow, but almost no signs of inflation itself and the economy seems to be settling once again into a period of modest growth that should allow price pressures to subside. **********The core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.6 percent last year, less than the 3 percent rate of 1995. **********As a result, Mr. Greenspan said, the Fed has ''taken care not to act prematurely'' by raising interest rates and potentially choking off growth as well as inflation. **********''Given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, however, we cannot rule out a situation in which a pre-emptive policy tightening may become appropriate before any actual sign of higher inflation becomes evident,'' he said. **********Mr. Greenspan cited several indicators suggesting that one of the primary factors holding down inflation -- the willingness of workers to accept relatively small wage increases because they fear losing their jobs -- might run its course. **********Economists generally agree that rising wages are the trigger for rising prices of goods and services as employers try to pass on their increased labor costs. But although the unemployment rate, which was 5.4 percent in January, is well below the level at which wages have tended to accelerate in the past, there has been only a relatively small increase in wages and few signs that those are spurring higher prices. **********While some surveys show that large numbers of workers still fear losing their job, Mr. Greenspan said, other figures indicated that last month workers were somewhat more willing to quit their jobs to seek another than they had been. **********Combined with continued strong levels of job creation, Mr. Greenspan said, the statistics raised ''questions about whether the transitional period of unusually slow wage gains may be drawing to a close.'' **********Mr. Greenspan has twice before raised public concerns about the stock market, first in early December when he questioned whether asset prices were being driven by ''irrational exuberance,'' and then in a brief discussion in Congressional testimony last month when he characterized the market's rise as ''breathtaking.'' **********After his remarks in December, the stock market fell briefly but then continued its upward march. His comments last month had almost no effect on the market. **********In his remarks today, Mr. Greenspan made no effort to hide behind the dense reasoning and obtuse language he often employs. Indeed, he analyzed stock valuations so directly that he often sounded more like an investment adviser than the head of the world's most powerful central bank. Mr. Greenspan said he believed the market was being propelled upward largely in response to expectations for rising corporate earnings. Even small changes in those expectations, he said, ''could have outsized impacts on equity prices.'' **********Mr. Greenspan also said that the perhaps lower-than-justified risk premiums attached to stocks relative to safer investments suggested that investors might have ''unrealistically'' optimistic views. **********''It is not that we have a firm view that equity prices are necessarily excessive right now or risk spreads patently too low,'' Mr. Greenspan said. Rather, he added, the Fed ''has to be sensitive to indications of even slowly building imbalances, whatever their source, that by fostering the emergence of inflation pressures would ultimately threaten healthy economic expansion.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/27/world/many-laotians-in-us-find-their-hopes-betrayed.html": {"writer_name": "Tim Weiner", "pub_date": "1997-12-27", "snippet": "Laotian-American spokesmen say recent cutoff of welfare benefits has led to sense of betrayal, despair and suicide among legal refugees; much of Laotian-American community consists of mountain tribesmen who emigrated with their families after bein...", "word_count": 1124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Many Laotians in U.S. Find Their Hopes Betrayed", "print_headline": "Many Laotians in U.S. Find Their Hopes Betrayed", "body_text": " **********From 1961 to 1974, the Central Intelligence Agency, carrying out the foreign policy of the United States, enlisted the mountain tribes of Laos as guerrillas in the Vietnam War. **********Some 36,000 Laotians battled North Vietnamese troops, rescued downed American pilots and guarded the radars that guided Air Force bombers. Thousands of the tribesmen died. In return, the United States gave the tribespeople rice and promised them refuge if things went badly. **********After the war, thousands of Laotian veterans and their families resettled in this country as refugees. But in last year's welfare reform act, Congress voted to deny some forms of Federal assistance to the 1.8 million legal immigrants in the United States. **********Now the Department of Agriculture, carrying out the domestic policy of the United States, has cut off food stamps to the Laotians. The cutoff led to despair and suicides among the refugees as it took effect in recent weeks, according to the Laotians' community leaders and lawyers. **********The Laotians, most of whom are members of the Hmong tribe, were migratory slash-and-burn farmers with only the rudiments of a written language when the C.I.A. arrived to teach them the art of modern war in 1961. They were left behind when the the United States left their country in 1974. **********Thousands of them, many physically or mentally wounded by war and exile, trekked through jungles to refugee camps in Thailand in the late 1970's. They settled in California, Minnesota, Wisconsin and a handful of other states, and have tried to overcome high barriers of skill, education, language and culture in a land far from their roots. **********''It's very difficult for our people to get a job,'' said Xia Cao Vang, director of the Lao Family Community Center in Sacramento, Calif.

So the Clinton Administration cut off the refugees' food stamps, affecting an estimated 16,000 Laotian veterans and tens of thousands of their family members. **********The Laotians present ''an extraordinarily compelling case,'' said Julie Paradis, the acting deputy undersecretary for food and nutrition at the Department of Agriculture, which administers the Federal food stamp program. **********''The Administration is committed to finding some way to take care of these people,'' Ms. Paradis said. But, she added, it may be up to Congress, not the White House, to solve the problem with new laws. **********Lawyers who represent the Laotians, however, say the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, has the authority to make food stamps available to the Laotians if he wishes. **********The cutoff of food stamps to the Laotians saved an estimated $9 million a year, or about one-thirtieth of 1 percent of the annual Federal food stamp budget. But the costs have been high for the refugees. **********In California, home to more than half the roughly 170,000 Laotian refugees, the effects have been especially harsh. **********This summer, California officials who administer the Federal program and the state's own food assistance shut off food stamps for nearly 20,000 Laotians between the ages of 18 and 65. The state denied appeals from 4,000 of them this fall, and ordered them to pay back the benefits they received during the months that their cases were appealed. **********The Lieutenant Governor of California, Gray Davis, asked the state's Social Services director last month to ''restore the benefits Hmong veterans in California recently lost and so unquestionably deserve.'' The request was denied. **********The veterans say their prospects for moving from welfare to work are slim. **********Khao Insixiengmay, a veteran of the C.I.A.'s secret war and head of the Lao Parents and Teachers Association in Minneapolis, said: ''Those who were trained and equipped by the C.I.A. and the American advisers and fought in the war had little time for education, and it was a long war.'' **********''When they came here they have little education, little skill,'' he said. ''Many became mentally and physically unstable.'' **********Now, with the cutbacks, ''people are under the poverty line and they have a problem to survive in this new society,'' he said. ''They do not know who to turn to.'' **********In Minnesota, where the state has provided some funds to make up for the Federal cutbacks, hundreds of Laotians have nonetheless been forced to turn to food banks for basic subsistence, said Daniel Krotz, executive director of Minneapolis's Center for Asians and Pacific Islanders. The heads of their families -- which, on average, include 8 to 10 people -- can find jobs paying little more than the minimum wage, he said. **********The state of Minnesota has honored the Lao veterans of the Vietnam war with a commemorative automobile license plate. But other than that, their sacrifice is largely unknown, or ignored, Mr. Krotz said. **********''And the license plate is not good to eat,'' Mr. Insixiengmay said with a small laugh. **********A sense of bitterness among people who served the United States in covert cold-war operations is not unique to the Laotians. Vietnamese commandos captured behind enemy lines during the war were written off as dead by the United States, only to reappear after many years in prison, asking for $2,000 a year in back pay. **********But the Laotians are a special case, according to C.I.A. veterans who worked with them during the Vietnam war. They fought so hard and so long in a losing cause that many families were down to the last surviving male, often a boy of 13 or 14, by the time the United States began pulling out. **********''Survival of the tribe was becoming a major concern'' by the time the United States began withdrawing from the war, according to an Air Force study. A quarter-century later, the Laotians say their prospects for survival have been damaged by welfare reform. **********''We feel that we have been betrayed,'' said Blong Lo, a leader of the Coalition for Hmong and Lao Veterans in Chico, Calif."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/27/world/kurds-fashion-two-identities-in-a-fearful-turkey.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1997-07-27", "snippet": "Turkey's Kurdish population is polarized, with some assimilated Kurds seeing themselves as primarily Turkish and others intractably clinging to their Kurdish heritage and demanding autonomy; more than a dozen Kurdish rebellions have occured since ...", "word_count": 1018, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kurds Fashion Two Identities in a Fearful Turkey", "print_headline": "Kurds Fashion Two Identities in a Fearful Turkey", "body_text": " **********More than 1,000 miles separate a defiant peasant named Baran, who lives in a refugee's hovel outside Van, in eastern Turkey, from a polished and successful Istanbul jeweler named Cemal. **********The gap in perception and experience between the two is even wider. All they have in common is that they are Kurdish citizens of Turkey. **********''I am a Kurd, but what difference does that make?'' asked Cemal as he sat behind a glass case full of gold bracelets and earrings. ''I'm Turkish. I love Turkey. Never once have I had a problem because I happen to have Kurdish blood. Everyone is equal in this country.'' **********To Baran, who fled his ancestral village rather than be pressed into the pro-Government village guards, things look very different. **********''My identity as a Kurd is the most precious thing I have,'' he said as his son listened solemnly.

I was born a Kurd, and nothing can ever make me a Turk.'' **********These two men, both of whom asked to be identified only by their first names, represent the twin paradigms of Kurdish life in Turkey: Until their world views can somehow be reconciled, the Government will find it all but impossible to resolve one of the world's bitterest and most intractable ethnic conflicts. **********It is a conflict that has produced more than a dozen rebellions over the last 80 years, cost untold amounts of blood and treasure and polarized public opinion here and abroad. The current revolt, led for the last 13 years by the Kurdistan Workers Party, has taken more than 20,000 lives, mostly in fighting in eastern Turkey. **********At a recent meeting here in Van, about 50 miles west of the Iranian border, senior Turkish military and intelligence officers agreed that the conflict cannot be resolved militarily. But like countless others who have pondered the problem, they failed to find a formula under which Turks and Kurds, the country's two principal ethnic groups, could live together without fighting. **********The Kurdish issue is so divisive that there is even debate about how many Kurds live in Turkey. A leading demographer, Cem Behar, recently estimated that as many as 10 million people speak Kurdish in a country with a total population of 63 million. Several million more Kurds live in Iran, Iraq, Syria and other nearby countries, concentrated in a region that has historically been known as Kurdistan. **********Decades of revolts since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923 have made Turkish authorities suspicious of nearly all Kurdish political, social and cultural movements. In their view, the line separating guerrillas from peaceful intellectuals and politicians often blurs. **********As recently as 1981, a member of Parliament was sentenced to three years in prison for asserting: ''There are Kurds in Turkey. I am a Kurd.'' Since then -- and especially after the late President Turgut Ozal broke a longstanding taboo by declaring that he was partly Kurdish -- laws have been loosened. It is no longer illegal to speak Kurdish in public or to play Kurdish music. **********Turkish officials often say that Kurds enjoy the same rights as other citizens. Thousands of Kurds are successful in many fields, and by some estimates more than one-fourth of the members of Parliament are of Kurdish extraction. These facts make it difficult to argue that Kurds suffer systematic discrimination. **********Kurdish leaders, however, say the path to success is open only to assimilated Kurds. The Government has strongly resisted Kurdish demands for cultural and political concessions. President Suleyman Demirel spoke for many Turks when he warned that such concessions would lead to ''compromise after compromise with no end.'' **********The Turkish Republic was founded after a rebellion against the terms of the 1920 Treaty of Sevres, in France,  under which most of what is now Turkey was to be divided among European powers. That trauma is said to have left Turks with ''Sevres syndrome,'' which Kemal Kirisci, author of a new study of the Kurdish problem, described as ''the deep belief that the outside world is always trying to take the country away from you.'' **********As a result, many Turks fear that giving autonomy to Kurds would lead to demands for independence, and that their country would split apart like Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union. **********''This is not something unique to Turkey, but what is specific here is that Turkey has nurtured this fear and integrated it into the state apparatus so successfully that most people are only now beginning to question it,'' Mr. Kirisci said. **********Efforts to forge a political party to speak for the Kurds have failed several times. Opponents of Kurdish nationalism, fearing such a party would serve as a wedge for separatists, have used various tactics to assure that none survive for long. **********The People's Democracy Party, which is now a principal civilian voice of Kurdish nationalism, was subjected to fierce criticism after someone tore down the Turkish flag at its 1996 convention and replaced it with a guerrilla banner. Criminal charges were filed against party leaders, and 31 of them were convicted in June of subversive activities and sentenced to prison terms. **********In 1991 a group of Kurds set up a foundation to promote Kurdish culture, and last year it was finally given legal status as the Kurdish Cultural and Research Foundation. In May it began offering Kurdish language courses, but the courses were quickly shut down by the police. The foundation's chairman, Yilmaz Camlibel, has been notified that criminal charges will be filed against him. **********At the foundation's headquarters in Istanbul, bathrooms are labeled Mer and Jin, the Kurdish words for men and women. But there are no students to use them, and Mr. Camlibel ruminates in his office under an allegorical painting that shows Kurds being sucked into a whirlpool. **********''If you speak Kurdish, you become Kurdish,'' he said. ''Maybe that is what they are afraid of. They don't mind allowing courses in any other language, even Japanese, but when we want to learn our language, they see it as a threat.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/22/business/fujitsu-raises-bid-for-amdahl-to-12.40-a-share.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-08-22", "snippet": "Fujitsu Ltd, which already owns 42 percent of Amdahl Corp, raises its bid for remainder by 3.3 percent, to $878 million, or $12.40 a share, in effort to settle shareholder lawsuits against proposed purchase (S)", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FUJITSU RAISES BID FOR AMDAHL TO $12.40 A SHARE", "print_headline": "FUJITSU RAISES BID FOR AMDAHL TO $12.40 A SHARE", "body_text": " **********Fujitsu Ltd., which already owns 42 percent of the Amdahl Corporation, raised its bid for the remainder by 3.3 percent, to $878 million, in an effort to settle shareholder lawsuits against the proposed purchase.

Only here can one sit in a European cafe and gaze across a narrow waterway to Asia. Behind are Vienna, Berlin and Paris; on the other side lies a vast,  unbroken expanse that stretches to Baghdad, Tashkent and Beijing. **********This geography has bequeathed to Turks an eternal identity crisis. For centuries they have been asking themselves where they truly belong. **********Today the question is more urgent than ever. Turkey is demanding entry into the European Union but cannot pry the door open. Turks are beginning to feel that Europe does not want them, and to wonder if they should look for friends elsewhere. **********European leaders insist that before Turkey can be considered for membership, it must improve its human rights record, end its war against Kurdish rebels and resolve its disputes with Greece. Many Turks consider these to be hypocritical arguments behind which Europeans hide their prejudice against Muslims. **********''At every turn, Turkey is being snubbed by Europe,'' said Baran Tuncer, an economist and former World Bank official. ''Countries like Bulgaria are being considered for membership ahead of us, countries which over the years have had no relation whatsoever with European political or economic values. The subtext is fear of what we represent religiously and culturally. People here are beginning to resent this attitude quite strongly, and anti-Western politicians are exploiting the resentment and fueling it.'' **********Membership in the European Union promises a host of benefits for Turkey, mostly economic but also psychological, and would hold out the prospect of steady progress toward greater democracy and prosperity here. Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, says he is as committed to European Union membership as any of his predecessors. But some militants in his party would, in the words of one adviser to the Government, ''love an excuse to throw up their hands, say 'Europe doesn't want us' and turn in another direction.'' **********This impulse was shown in December, when Mr. Erbakan refused to go to a European Union summit meeting in Dublin. He said the union  was insulting Turkey because the dinner to which he was invited was scheduled after the meeting's official end, when not all heads of government would be present. **********Many Turks applauded Mr. Erbakan's gesture, but European leaders took it as a signal that Turkey was not really serious about joining the union, or did not know how to press its case. As further evidence that Mr. Erbakan's Government does not understand the ground rules of diplomacy, Europeans have pointed to the threat by Turkey, a NATO member, to veto NATO expansion if it does not receive better treatment from the European Union. **********European ambivalence toward Turkey is hardly a new phenomenon. It dates back hundreds of years to an era when ''the Turk'' was a European archetype, a symbol of ''the other'' and even the antichrist. **********Ottoman armies nearly took Vienna in 1683, and for a time the central question of Europe was whether the Ottomans would sweep into France and Germany, turning the continent into a vassal of the Sultan. **********Today, Europe's treatment of Turkey is a sensitive subject not only here but also in the broad band of Turkic nations that stretches across the Caucasus and Central Asia. The success or failure of Turkish efforts is likely to affect perceptions of Europe across this region. **********In January 1996, Turkey entered into a customs union with the Europeans under which both sides dropped most tariffs and other trade restrictions. But rather than bringing Turkey closer to Europe, the agreement has been a source of new discord. **********''The customs union created misconceptions on both sides,'' said Michael Lake, the European Union envoy in Ankara. ''The European side felt that Turkey would be preoccupied with making it work and not press for full membership for some time. Turkey had the misperception that the customs union was a stepping stone toward full membership in the next year or two. This led to a drifting apart, which both sides are now determined to reverse. **********''I do not feel that if the membership of Turkey arises naturally in the fullness of time, the E. U. can sustain a veto on the basis of religion or culture. That would undermine the importance we place on democracy. Turkey is the only fully democratic Muslim country in the world. To keep Turkey out on this basis would send the wrong signal to the whole Mediterranean basin and the world at large.'' **********Not every European official is so sure. In an unusually frank statement this month, Hans van Mierlo, Foreign Minister of the Netherlands, said it was ''time for us in Europe to be honest'' about the religious aspect of the issue. **********''There is a problem of a large Muslim state,'' Mr. van Mierlo told a committee of the European Parliament. ''Do we want that in Europe? It is an unspoken question.'' **********Other obstacles to Turkey's membership are clearer. Certainly the most emotional is human rights. A host of reports by groups that have investigated conditions here say that torture is regularly practiced in Turkish jails. In addition, laws restrict freedom of expression, and dozens of writers and journalists are in jail. Army tactics in the war against Kurdish separatists often seem at least as brutal as those used by the separatists themselves. **********''The human rights situation is a disaster,'' said a European Ambassador in Ankara. ''Turkey is far, far away from what the European Parliament will insist on.'' **********Government officials acknowledge this problem, although they insist that it is not as serious as some outsiders say. They are considering a series of measures ranging from repeal of laws that restrict free speech to creation of a judicial police force that would monitor conditions in detention centers. **********On other issues that have been raised as obstacles to Turkish membership, Turkish negotiators have in recent months shown a new flexibility that contrasts with, or complements, the more militant position taken by Prime Minister Erbakan. **********They are offering to prevent a flood of low-wage Turkish laborers into Western Europe and to refrain from claiming the large sums of aid that would be necessary to bring rural Turkey up to European standards of development. **********In recent weeks, another concern was added to the list as officials in several European countries suggested that Turkish officials were protecting heroin smugglers. **********The diplomat who is leading the Turkish bid to join the European Union, Onur Oymen, secretary general of the Foreign Ministry, acknowledges that he faces ''an uphill battle.'' **********''If the E. U. presents objective criteria and says that the first countries which fulfill them will be the first to be admitted, we can accept that,'' Mr. Oymen said. ''Let talks begin with all applicants, see which ones reach the targets, and then admit them in that order. What is really unacceptable to us is if different standards, different criteria are applied to us than are applied to other countries. **********''It would be a very great mistake to make the E. U. a religious or cultural entity. It would be against everything we have learned about European values. We do not want a cultural or religious iron curtain to replace the political iron curtain that we fought for 50 years to remove.'' **********Many foreigners here believe that although well-organized anti-Turkish lobbies are hard at work in Europe, Turkey could do much more to counter them. They say that Turkish governments have not tried hard enough to present their country's positive side. **********''Behind us are 600 years as masters of the Ottoman Empire,'' said Yilidrim Akturk, an American-trained economist who is a member of Parliament. ''We are children of the Ottoman experience. We don't believe in bending over, even if it's to pick up a big check. We want to preserve our pride.'' **********Turkish diplomats who are waging the campaign for European Union membership believe they are engaged in a historic effort crucial to their country's future, and cannot imagine that they will be kept out forever. **********''Even in the worst of times,'' observed Omer Akbel, the chief Foreign Ministry spokesman, ''we were the sick man of Europe, not Asia.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/02/business/expansion-control-helps-smooth-airlines-wild-earnings-ride.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Bryant", "pub_date": "1997-01-02", "snippet": "Airlines' new stress on profitability over market share has helped them smooth out industry's historically wide-swinging business cycle and raise fares; industry is expected to report record 1996 profits; big new plane orders raise prospects that ...", "word_count": 757, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Expansion Control Helps Smooth Airlines' Wild Earnings Ride", "print_headline": "Expansion Control Helps Smooth Airlines' Wild Earnings Ride", "body_text": " **********The airline industry has made remarkable progress in recent years in smoothing out its historically wide-swinging business cycle. For a lot of consumers, that is too bad. **********After all, it has long been one of the industry's failings that in good times, the airlines as a group would order far more aircraft than they really needed. By the time the planes were delivered, traffic growth had typically fallen off, leaving too many planes for too few passengers. And because an empty seat is worthless to the airlines, they would start bruising fare wars -- to the cheers of travelers -- to fill their seats. **********The most recent such bonanza occurred in the summer of 1992, when airlines cut fares as much as 50 percent on many routes. **********That fare sale and the effects of the Persian Gulf war on oil prices and travel were some of the many problems that contributed to the American airline industry's cumulative losses of more than $13 billion between 1990 and 1994. **********These losses apparently taught the industry a lesson about overexpansion: Profits are more important than market share. It was an obvious lesson in hindsight, but required the airlines to discard a long-cherished notion that size and market share were the paths to profits. **********After a couple of years with a good economy and the tight control maintained by airlines over the number of seats in the market, the industry is expected to report record profits for 1996. This discipline has given the airlines a rare ability to set fares at profitable levels. **********This means that fares have been going up. Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares magazine, keeps a running tally of fare increases, and said that the industry had raised fares more than 35 times since 1992. Now, those same round-trip tickets for flights between New York and the West Coast that sold for less than $200 in 1992 cost at least twice that much, even at sale prices. **********Mr. Parsons said that fare increases could be attributed to more than tighter airline capacity and a healthy economy. Airlines now have a more sophisticated understanding of traffic patterns on their routes, and know more precisely what travelers are willing to pay. **********''When the airlines are doing well, consumers are going to have to work harder to get the big savings,'' Mr. Parsons said. **********However, consumers still hoping for the industry to return to its self-defeating ways were given new reasons to be optimistic about fares recently. Shortly after the industry appeared to be on its way to an unusual run of sustained profitability, it resumed the old habits that had led to excess capacity and had exaggerated the effects of the broader economic cycles. **********The USAir Group, for example, placed an order in early November for up to 400 aircraft from Airbus Industrie. That order, however, is contingent upon USAir management's getting an agreement from its labor groups to lower its costs, currently the highest in the industry. **********Two weeks later, American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, placed a firm order for 103 new jets from the Boeing Company, and said that it might order several hundred more planes from Boeing as part of a deal in which it committed itself to making Boeing its sole supplier of aircraft for the next 20 years. **********But the new planes do not necessarily mean more capacity. Because of tough Federal noise standards that go into effect in 2000, many of the new planes will simply replace older models that will be sold outside the United States because the cost of modifying them to meet the tougher standards is too great. And despite the large orders from American and USAir, aircraft orders and scheduled deliveries for the industry last year still remain below earlier peaks. **********Even so, the new orders are prompting many industry analysts on Wall Street to re-evaluate their estimates of capacity growth. **********Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst at Paine Webber, said that his estimate for the airlines' total capacity growth for 1997 is 4.3 percent. Two years ago, he had projected 3.5 percent. The capacity growth, he said, suggests that airline executives are losing some sense of self-discipline. ''There is no question they are losing their religion,'' Mr. Buttrick said. **********Will that mean a return to the kind of fare wars that prompted so many spontaneous trips in 1992? With the airline industry's notorious unpredictability, no one is willing to guess. But for now, the industry is enjoying the rare thrill of profitability. **********''There is nothing more exciting,'' David A. Swierenga, chief economist at the Air Transport Association, said, ''than making money.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/06/world/swiss-to-use-gold-for-a-holocaust-fund.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1997-03-06", "snippet": "Swiss Government proposes setting up $4.7 billion fund and using interest on money to help victims of Holocaust and other calamities; under proposal, Switzerland would increase stated value of its gold reserves to correspond to current world marke...", "word_count": 1165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Swiss to Use Gold for a Holocaust Fund", "print_headline": "Swiss to Use Gold for a Holocaust Fund", "body_text": " **********The Swiss Government today proposed setting up a $4.7 billion fund and using the interest on the money to help victims of the Holocaust and other calamities. **********Under the proposal, Switzerland would increase the stated value of its gold reserves to correspond to current world market prices, and use the difference as the principal for the new fund. **********The plan represents the boldest financial maneuver yet by the Swiss to gain moral high ground in the dispute over the country's dealings with Nazi Germany in World War II. **********At the same time, the Swiss National Bank offered to donate about $70 million to a separate fund set up last week for short-term help to Holocaust survivors, doubling the value of that fund. **********Both proposals require the Swiss Parliament's approval to take effect, and they could face major opposition if right-wing Swiss politicians decide to campaign against them. **********The Government's proposal today, announced at an unusual breakfast-time session of Parliament by President Arnold Koller, represented not only a far greater commitment of money than previously discussed but also an attempt to walk the thin line between international pressure and domestic reluctance to use taxpayers' money for what many Swiss regard as an unjustified acknowledgment of wartime guilt. **********The plan would not involve extra spending by the Government. **********Switzerland, which has been under increasing pressure from the World Jewish Congress and its political allies in New York and Washington to atone for both its wartime dealings with Nazi Germany and the resistance of its private banks to helping relatives gain access to bank accounts and other assets belonging to Holocaust victims. **********Last month the Swiss Government finally agreed to share with Jewish organizations the administration of a separate fund, financed principally by Swiss private banks and, as of today, the Swiss National Bank, to compensate Holocaust survivors living in Eastern Europe, Israel, the United States and elsewhere. **********But the proposal today went much further, offering, as President Koller told a meeting of the upper and lower houses of Parliament here, to create a ''Swiss Foundation for Solidarity'' drawn from funds accruing from the increased estimate of the value of its gold deposits. **********Switzerland has kept the value of its gold low by estimating the worth of its deposits at about one-third of the price they would bring on world markets. **********The interest from the new fund would ''be destined for victims of poverty and catastrophes, of genocide and other severe breaches of human rights, such as of course victims of the Holocaust,'' Mr. Koller said. He did not specify other likely beneficiaries from the proposed foundation. **********Mr. Koller said the foundation could be created by next year, the 150th anniversary of Switzerland's foundation as a modern state, and would be used ''half in Switzerland, half abroad.'' **********He put the overall value of the proposed fund at ''about seven billion Swiss francs,'' or $4.7 billion at current exchange rates, yielding several hundred million dollars a year in interest. **********''This shows us that the Swiss people have finally got it,'' Israel Singer, the secretary general of the World Jewish Congress, said in a telephone interview from New York, reflecting a broadly positive response by Jewish groups in the United States, Israel and Switzerland. **********But the proposal could further deepen a rift in Swiss society, particularly between younger people who believe that their country played an ambiguous, if not collaborationist, role toward Nazi Germany and older Swiss who see outside pressure for atonement as a Jewish conspiracy. **********''The Federal Council has lost its head,'' said Christoph Blocher, a leading rightist. ''These are public assets, not just any money.'' **********Swiss Government officials say they fear that Mr. Blocher could try to organize a referendum to block the entire proposal. **********Until today, the Swiss Government and the Swiss National Bank had held back from committing themselves financially. **********But President Koller's largely conciliatory speech sought to defend Switzerland against its critics and acknowledge that Switzerland's wartime neutrality had ''its bright sides and its dark sides.'' **********''Today we do not have to feel ashamed that we escaped the war,'' Mr. Koller said today. ''Every country defended primarily its own interests. And we, too, were entitled to this right. We had the right to survive. **********''But nevertheless the question arises as to whether and to what extent all Swiss citizens managed to satisfy the high moral demands during the war period,'' he said. ''That means that we have to publicly admit self-criticism and admit the dark sides of that difficult period.'' **********The announcement coincided with the opening session here of a commission of foreign and Swiss historians, appointed by the Government, to investigate Switzerland's dealings with Nazi Germany. **********In addition, a separate commission led by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, is investigating the question of dormant accounts left by people killed in the Holocaust. And a third inquiry into the affair is being conducted by an interagency group in Washington led by Stuart E. Eisenstat, Deputy Commerce Secretary for International Trade. **********That group is set to publish a report of its findings this month, leading to speculation that one reason for the timing of today's announcement was to pre-empt further criticism from Washington of Switzerland's wartime behavior. **********''None of this would have happened without outside pressure,'' said an American Jewish official with close knowledge of the negotiations leading to the Swiss reversal. **********According to Hans Meyer, the chairman of the Swiss National Bank, Switzerland's gold deposits are calculated for central bank bookkeeping purposes at a fixed price equivalent to $117 an ounce, compared to the current market price of about $350. **********By calculating its gold deposits at the free market price, Mr. Meyer said, ''several billion francs could be transferred in gold'' to the proposed foundation. **********''This would permit investments yielding annual income of several hundred million francs which would be available for fulfilling the foundation's objectives,'' he said. ''It is envisioned that the foundation would sell the gold transferred to it in the market of a period of approximately 10 years and invest the proceeds in interest-bearing assets.'' **********Those sales, he said, should not affect the market price of either gold or the Swiss franc.

Executives said they had no immediate plans to sell the vehicles in the United States, though that is a possibility later. ''We are very confident about what this offers,'' said Akihiro Wada, an executive vice president of Toyota, ''but we would like to get reaction and criticism by testing it in the Japanese market first.'' **********Hybrid vehicles significantly reduce emissions compared with gasoline-powered cars but are far more practical than fully electric cars. They cannot achieve the zero-emission level of the fully electric car, which California regulators have been seeking. But many auto engineers believe that the hybrid approach represents a reasonable compromise. **********Toyota estimates that its hybrid car will get 66 miles a gallon of gasoline in Japanese fuel-economy tests, twice the efficiency of a similar-size Corolla. Emissions of carbon dioxide would be cut in half, and those of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides reduced 90 percent. **********Many other companies are working on hybrid vehicles. Detroit's Big Three -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- are pursuing them, in an effort partly financed by the Department of Energy, to develop a high-efficiency supercar. Audi, a division of Volkswagen, is said to have a hybrid car using a diesel engine ready for sale later this year, and Renault has also announced hybrid technology. **********Until recently, much of the emphasis in cutting automotive air pollution had focused on fully electric vehicles, because California was requiring that 2 percent of the cars sold there beginning in the 1998 model year have zero-emission levels. **********But last year, with auto makers insisting that it would be a long time until it was possible to make an electric vehicle that would satisfy consumers, California dropped that deadline, though it is still aiming for 10 percent of vehicles sold in 2003 to have no emissions. **********Takehisa Yaegashi, chief engineer for Toyota's hybrid system, said the company hoped that California might further relax its requirements and accept hybrid vehicles instead of electric ones. **********General Motors in December began offering an electric vehicle in California and Arizona, but has sold only a few dozen a month. The Honda Motor Company, Toyota and possibly others are expected to begin sales of electric vehicles in California this year. **********The hybrid vehicles could avoid a major shortcoming of fully electric ones -- the limited range of the batteries. G.M.'s electric vehicle goes only about 90 miles before the battery must be recharged, a process that takes about three hours. **********But the hybrid vehicle can also travel farther because it uses gasoline. And energy from the gasoline engine can recharge the battery while the car is in motion, so that no external recharging is needed. **********Hybrids can achieve high efficiency and low pollution because of the way they combine dissimilar propulsion systems. Gasoline systems are good for quick refueling, but get zero miles a gallon when the car is idling; in a hybrid, that energy can be converted to current for the batteries. And if the engine runs at a constant speed, the antipollution system can operate at most efficient levels for that speed. **********Electric systems are clean and powerful but rely on slow recharging, which is cumbersome if the car has to stand still. And the gasoline engines used in hybrids can be small and light, because they do not have to be big enough to meet peak demand -- acceleration to highway speeds; for that, they can get help from the electric motor. **********Because hybrid cars can get by with smaller batteries, they also should cost significantly less than fully electric cars, Toyota executives said. They would not disclose the price of their new car, but said they aimed to keep it no more than about $4,000 more expensive than a similar-size conventional car, implying a price of less than $20,000 for a compact model. By contrast, the G.M. electric vehicle, which seats only two people, has a price of $34,000. **********Toyota officials suggested that they expected to sell significantly more hybrid vehicles than the several hundred a year electric cars that most makers expect to sell. But they would not announce a sales target and conceded that the hybrid car's higher price compared with conventional cars would limit sales. **********In Toyota's hybrid vehicle, power from the gasoline engine is split into two paths -- one directly turning the wheels and the other operating an electric generator. The generator's electricity output can be used to turn a motor that drives the wheels, or to charge the battery. The proportion of power allocated to each path is automatically adjusted to achieve maximum efficiency. **********When the car is started and moving slowly, only the electric motor is used because gasoline engines operate inefficiently at such low speeds. In normal driving the gasoline engine is used, perhaps assisted by the electric motor during acceleration. When the car is slowed, the gasoline engine is shut off and the momentum of revolving wheels helps recharge the nickel-metal hydride battery. **********Toyota is not banking solely on hybrids but is pursuing many different technologies for increasing fuel efficiency and lowering emissions, such as lean-burning gasoline engines, electric vehicles and cars that use other kinds of fuel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/10/business/grey-unit-joins-a-toronto-agency.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1997-03-10", "snippet": "Mediacom Worldwide, unit of Grey Advertising Inc, forms joint venture with Media Buying Services Ltd in Toronto, to form media services agency there named Media Company/MBS (S)", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Grey Unit Joins A Toronto Agency", "print_headline": "Grey Unit Joins A Toronto Agency", "body_text": " **********Mediacom Worldwide, the media services unit of Grey Advertising Inc. in New York, has formed a joint venture with Media Buying Services Ltd. in Toronto, the largest independent media services agency in Canada, to form a media services agency there named the Media Company/MBS.

These days, though, Ms. Lockhart walks half a block in this city's central business district to the new Cigarettes Cheaper shop, where her Salems cost just $2.39. **********''It's even less than at the convenience store near my home on the South Side,'' she said. ''It would be great if there were more places like this.'' **********Chances are good there will be. Even though the nation is preparing to restrict cigarette retailing, shops that sell little but cigarettes at discount prices -- once found mainly just over the borders of cities and states with high tobacco taxes -- have been rapidly colonizing urban storefronts and suburban strip malls. Tobacco is anything but a growth industry in America, but the cigarette stores are betting that the harsher climate will stoke demand for specialized retailing, just as ''category killer'' vendors have emerged for things like toys and books. **********Cigarette shops serve one goal of tobacco foes by diverting sales of cigarettes from stores frequented by children. But health authorities fret that they also give smokers a way to dodge the impact of the price increases envisioned in the tentative $368 billion settlement with tobacco manufacturers. **********In 1992, there were only about 400 such stores, handling a little more than 1 percent of cigarettes sold. By last year that had jumped to around 4,500 outlets, accounting for 11 percent of sales, according to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the nation's second-largest tobacco company, after the Philip Morris Companies. **********''This is the way cigarettes should be sold everywhere,'' said Ned Roscoe, vice president of the family-owned Premium Tobacco Stores Inc., which owns the three-year-old Cigarettes Cheaper chain. The company, based in Benicia, Calif., has 390 stores in eight states in the West and Midwest. **********Although such specialty stores have for the most part shied away from states like New York that have high state cigarette taxes, Mr. Roscoe says he plans to be in the top 20 metropolitan markets, including the New York area, in the next year and a half. **********But Mr. Roscoe and other industry insiders say new cigarette stores are opening at a slower pace this year, amid the uncertainty about tobacco regulation. Cigarettes Cheaper, which has expanded most aggressively, has been unable to agree with potential investors on terms for financing more growth. And some supermarkets and convenience stores are providing tougher competition by building ''stores within stores'' featuring tobacco. **********The future of the $45 billion domestic tobacco industry, however, clearly includes tougher restrictions on marketing and higher prices. And both trends could give the cigarette stores a new leg up on less focused competitors like grocers -- and even on convenience stores, which have doubled their share of tobacco sales to nearly half the market since 1984. **********''The cigarette stores are on the launching pad,'' said Kenneth Harris, a consultant who follows tobacco retailing for Cannondale Associates of Evanston, Ill. One of their main advantages, he said, is that they are typically adult-only enterprises with better-than-average track records on avoiding sales to minors. **********''It may ultimately make licensing and preventing youth access easier,'' said Dr. David Burns, a researcher at the University of California at San Diego, who has been an adviser to plaintiffs' lawyers in tobacco litigation. **********But there is concern about the health impact of the cigarette stores' low prices. Analysts figure the tobacco pact would drive average prices up anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent as the industry passed along the settlement costs. Some smokers would respond by switching to cheaper brands, but health officials hope millions of others will smoke less or quit, as they did after past price increases. **********They worry that the proliferation of cigarette stores promoting bargain prices on premium brands like Marlboro and Camel may offer many smokers a deadly alternative -- avoiding some or all of any price increase by switching where they shop. **********Tobacco manufacturers will not comment on any possible impact of the settlement, including this one. **********But other vendors will have a lot to say about whether cigarette stores continue to grow rapidly, said Brian Stockdale, vice president for wholesale and retail trade marketing at R. J. Reynolds in Winston-Salem, N.C., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings. **********''Most of the outlets are in the same shopping strips and malls as grocery stores because grocers aren't pushing the category,'' Mr. Stockdale said. **********Indeed, many grocers have pulled the plug on tobacco promotions to avoid offending nonsmokers. They have also kept prices up to maintain traditional tobacco profit margins of more than 20 percent and have cut back on easy customer access to tobacco to control theft and sales to minors. **********Cigarette stores say that any restrictions on marketing will be easier for them to adapt to because nothing they sell is meant for minors; if they successfully keep minors out, for instance, they will not have to take down signs and additional tobacco-company promotional materials that other stores will no longer be able to display. **********The grocery share of tobacco sales fell from 36 percent in 1988 to 18 percent last year as first convenience stores and then the new tobacco shops stole business. Unlike convenience stores, which usually sell a pack at a time, cigarette stores appeal more directly to grocery store customers, who tend to purchase cigarettes by the carton. **********Many drugstores have become even more reluctant than grocers to push tobacco, in part because they have frequently been attacked as hypocrites for selling such a deadly product along with medicine. **********At the Walgreen drugstore just half a block from Cigarettes Cheaper's Madison Street outlet here, Marlboros cost $2.85 a pack, compared with $2.15 at the tobacco shop. **********Tobacco sales at that Walgreen are off noticeably since Cigarettes Cheaper moved in, said Michael Polzin, a spokesman for the Walgreen Company. But Walgreen, the nation's largest drug chain, is sticking with its premium pricing, limited display racks, ban on tobacco advertising and promotion and a standard layout that allows only cashiers to reach the cigarettes. **********''We carry cigarettes strictly as a convenience for our customers,'' Mr. Polzin said. **********Convenience stores are expected to fight much harder to retain their share of the market. ''It's 25 percent to 30 percent of their merchandise revenue,'' said Hugh Houghton, director of the National Advisory Group, a Florida trade group for independent convenience stores. ''They can't afford to let that go.'' **********Many convenience stores will simply cut prices to the bone to hang on to customers, but other convenience stores, like some grocers, are building ''stores within a store'' to attract smokers and keep minors away. ''At the end of this reshuffling, I think convenience stores will gain market share,'' said Gus Olympidis, president of the Family Express Corporation, a chain of 26 convenience stores based in Valparaiso, Ind., that in a test is building glass-enclosed tobacco shops in two of its stores. **********Cigarette stores typically sell cigars, chewing and pipe tobacco and tobacco-related books and magazines as well as cigarettes; most also carry a limited selection of gum, candy and drinks. But the business is driven by the nicotine cravings of the nation's 46 million cigarette smokers. **********Stores like Cigarettes Cheaper keep prices low in part by selling an average of about 1,000 cartons a week, more than five times the volume of the average convenience store. Many keep operating costs to a minimum by relying on a single employee working a 10-  or 11-hour day to run an entire store. And they live with tobacco profit margins of less than 10 percent. **********But low prices are just part of their strategy. Cigarette stores also have a broader range of brands and packaging than most other retailers, a more regular diet of promotions and, store operators say, a welcoming attitude to smokers that is increasingly rare. **********''We have a philosophy of being very courteous and giving smokers the dignity they deserve,'' said David Bershof, a Denver entrepreneur, who has organized a consortium of nine tobacco distributors called Smoker Friendly International that operates 125 outlets from California to Pennsylvania. **********The Cigarette Store, a 25-store California chain based in Modesto, advertises its friendliness by doling out dog biscuits to customers who show up with a canine companion. **********Cigarettes Cheaper is the industry's brash enfant terrible. The Roscoe family, operators of a discount grocery business, opened its first cigarette store in October 1994. John Roscoe, the family patriarch and an outspoken libertarian, has used the stores as a platform to rail against Government interference with the rights of adults to pursue private vices. That has not stopped the company from also publicizing a ''model ordinance'' that would restrict tobacco sales to shops like Cigarettes Cheaper as a way of regulating sales to minors. **********What grabbed attention in the industry, though, is not such public relations high jinks but Cigarettes Cheaper's decision to go for rapid expansion based on exclusive marketing agreements with Philip Morris. That move defrayed some initial development costs and now assures the chain unbeatable prices on Marlboro, by far the nation's best-selling cigarette, and other Philip Morris brands. **********All the cigarette signs in its stores and on its fixtures feature Philip Morris brands, even those on racks carrying rival brands, like the Salems favored by Ms. Lockhart, which are made by R. J. Reynolds. In the Loop store visited by Ms. Lockhart, Marlboro gear and Virginia Slims clothing provide both decoration and prizes for drawings. **********Philip Morris, with more than half the market, says that the same arrangements have been offered to any retailer that wants to emphasize its brands. Most balk, though, because such deals require them to forgo some promotional support from the other manufacturers. **********''If we participate in all the Philip Morris promotions outside the exclusivity, we can match Cigarettes Cheaper on Marlboro about eight months of the year and be cheaper on everything else,'' said James Reed, president and owner of Patton Vending Machines Inc., which owns the Cigarette Store chain in California. (An unrelated, larger chain based in Boulder, Colo., operates under the same name in other areas, including the Midwest and the Rocky Mountain states.) **********The rapid expansion of Cigarettes Cheaper has had its drawbacks. It has led to missteps that have already forced it to close more than 20 stores. **********Ned Roscoe conceded that some problems existed, such as the fact that pay, which includes a share of operating profits above certain levels, was low at new stores. But managers in stores open two years or more in California earn as much as $45,000, he said. He readily agreed with the criticism that the growth rate had outpaced the company's management skills. Growth has slowed sharply, though, following the failure to work out financing for an expansion to 500 stores by the end of last year. **********Mr. Roscoe and other entrepreneurs in the field agree that future rapid expansion is far from a given. ''The low-margin, high-volume tobacco business is much more difficult than it appears,'' Mr. Roscoe said. ''It's extremely competitive.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/06/business/good-fit-starting-pinch-nine-west-tries-fend-off-investigations-debt.html": {"writer_name": "Melody Petersen", "pub_date": "1997-12-06", "snippet": "Signs of trouble at Nine West Group, leading shoe manufacturer, discussed; include Securities and Exchange Commission probe of possible accounting irregularities, which led to sharp drop in stock price; company warns fourth-quarter earnings will b...", "word_count": 1783, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Good Fit Is Starting to Pinch; Nine West Tries to Fend Off Investigations and Debt", "print_headline": "A Good Fit Is Starting to Pinch; Nine West Tries to Fend Off Investigations and Debt", "body_text": " **********Jerome Fisher and Vincent Camuto founded their shoe company in 1977 on a simple but brilliant idea: spot the hottest designs on the fashion runways and quickly make the shoes affordable for the middle-class masses by manufacturing them in Brazil. **********The strategy seems to have paid off handsomely for the two men and their company, which was named for its first location, at 9 West 57th Street in Manhattan. The company, now known as Nine West Group, says that one of every five pairs of shoes that American women buy comes from Nine West. In shopping malls across the nation, women with $50 to $80 to spend on a pair of shoes can hardly miss one of the company's 13 brands, from the classy Enzo Angiolini to the comfortable Easy Spirit. **********But now there are signs of trouble -- everything from investigations by two Government agencies to mounting debts and slower sales. The company's stock, recently a darling among Wall Street's retail stocks, has fallen 45 percent in price from this year's high of $52.75. It closed yesterday at $29 a share, up 50 cents. Much of the drop came after management said in May that the Securities and Exchange Commission had been inquiring for at least six months about possible accounting irregularities concerning its wholesale revenues. Company officials first disclosed the inquiry in a paragraph deep inside a routine public filing. Stunned shareholders wondered why the company had not been more up front about the investigation. **********Just when stockholders were beginning to believe management's repeated assurances that the S.E.C. would find little amiss, the shoe company announced last month that the agency  was widening its investigation to look at the company's imports from Brazil. The company also reported that customs officials were making a separate inquiry into the Brazilian imports. **********Even before the investigations hit, there were problems. Company officials had publicly boasted of double-digit gains in sales. Most of that growth, however, comes from acquisitions and new stores. Take those figures out of the picture, and sales at stores that have been open for several months are falling. For the third quarter, those same-store sales were down 3 percent from a year ago. **********The Oppenheimer Total Return Fund decided to sell its 5 percent stake in Nine West about six months ago, after the company's storerooms were left filled with boxes of open-toe shoes that had languished during the snowy spring, said Bruce Bartlett, who manages the fund. **********''It looks like an inexpensive stock,'' Mr. Bartlett said, noting that shares now sell for about 11 times this year's earnings. ''But we question the direction of the earnings.'' **********The company, nearly debt free in 1994, borrowed deeply in 1995 when it paid $600 million for the footwear divisions of the U.S. Shoe Corporation. Now it must warn investors in S.E.C. filings that interest expense is eating into its cash and that the high debt could upset its expansion plans. **********If anything, the company should be sitting pretty, with 60 percent of its goods coming from Brazil, whose currency has weakened against the dollar. Instead, management warned yesterday that fourth-quarter earnings would be 40 percent lower than expected. **********The two founders declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a  statement to shareholders, Mr. Fisher, the chairman, blamed fashion faux pas in part for the disappointing year. He said the company was also facing ''shipping challenges'' in its accessories division. **********''We have taken action by critically evaluating every aspect of our business,'' Mr. Fisher's statement added. For one thing, the company vowed this week to lower the price of certain shoes by as much as 5 to 8 percent. **********Despite selling most of the company to the public in 1993, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Camuto -- who describe  themselves as experts in shoes, rather than finance -- are still very much in charge, judging from comments by people inside and outside the company. **********Some experts on corporate practice question whether some things would be different if outside shareholders had more sway. Specifically, they find fault with the company's small board, with a chief financial officer who comes straight out of the company's accounting firm and with the company's leasing office space from its two founders. **********Mr. Fisher and Mr. Camuto, the chief executive officer, occupy two seats on the company's five-member board. John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at Columbia University, said that public companies similar to the billion-dollar Nine West  often had boards of 12 directors or more, with 80 percent of the members coming from outside. **********The other three directors are C. Gerald Goldsmith, an investment consultant from Palm Beach, Fla.; Henry W. Pascarella, a lawyer in Greenwich, Conn., and Salvatore M. Salibello, a partner at the small accounting firm of Salibello & Broder in New York. **********The board, which ordinarily meets only four times a year, has been kind to top management. Mr. Fisher and Mr. Camuto each received $1.8 million in salary and bonus last year. The two have also found another way to make money from Nine West: by sharing a 15.5 percent stake in a partnership that owns the company's headquarters in Stamford, Conn. The company is relocating to White Plains but must continue to pay rent -- now more than $2 million a year --  on the Stamford building until 2002, unless it can find someone to sublet  it. **********At least two family members also work for the company. Mr. Fisher's son, Marc, earned $982,808 last year  as president of a division that sells shoes under other companies' names. The chairman's daughter, Jodi, also works at the company, fielding calls from reporters. **********Mr. Galvin, the chief financial officer, is a former partner in Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, which has long audited the company's books. He was hired after he advised Mr. Fisher and Mr. Camuto on the U.S. Shoe acquisition. **********It is legal for companies to hire former auditors. But Mr. Galvin's prior employment at Deloitte raises ticklish questions about the independence of the accounting firm before and after he was hired, and about whether a pending job offer could have influenced Deloitte's  reading of the Nine West books. Even now, his intimate knowledge of Deloitte's auditing procedures and his relationship with various professionals could make it harder for the firm to conduct its audit. **********A Deloitte spokeswoman said the firm would not comment on a client matter. **********Mr. Coffee, the law professor, said, ''All of this company's watchdogs look a bit tame.'' He added that the small corporate board and the founders' ownership in the real estate partnership, which would likely be unacceptable at other public companies, seemed to be characteristic of ''a somewhat dysfunctional company that has not yet made the leap from a private company to truly public company.'' **********But Mr. Galvin said the company believed that the board was large enough to give its public shareholders a strong voice. He said outside consultants with expertise in corporate compensation had determined that Marc Fisher's salary was appropriate. And he said that while he had worked on the audit of the company while he was at Deloitte, he was not the partner in charge of the audit. He said the entire board -- not just Mr. Fisher and Mr. Camuto -- had approved his hiring. **********In an interview, Mr. Pascarella, the board member from Greenwich, said he was comfortable with the company's management and its response to the investigations. In addition to holding a special board meeting with management this fall, he said the three outside directors had met privately with their own counsel and with representatives of Deloitte to discuss the S.E.C. inquiry. He also said he was confident with management's assurances that the problems were not material. **********That said, the scrutiny is proving painful for a company that was always at its best taking on the industry. Now, it has grown so much that it is the industry. **********''The founders were very great entrepreneurs,'' said Faye I. Landes, an analyst at Smith Barney Inc. ''But this is now a very big and complicated company.'' She is not recommending the stock to clients. **********The company became more complex with the U.S. Shoe purchase, which doubled the number of its retail stores. Some U.S. Shoe brands were losing money, but Nine West management thought it could turn them around by manufacturing overseas. This year, it closed three Midwest shoe factories that had been operated by U.S. Shoe, so that it could buy even more shoes from Brazil. The company laid off more than 1,000  workers in Kentucky and Indiana, including 300 in Vanceburg, Ky.,  where the unemployment rate was already more than 10 percent. **********Now, S.E.C. investigators are looking at the way Nine West recorded wholesale revenues at some of the former U.S. Shoe divisions, in the seven months from the acquisition through the fiscal year ending Feb. 1, 1996, according to Nine West news releases. The company says it records revenues when the shoes are shipped to wholesale customers, who resell the shoes through noncompany outlets like department stores. **********The S.E.C., as is its policy, will not confirm an inquiry or comment on whether one has begun. While it is not clear what the S.E.C. may suspect, some other companies have run into problems with the agency when they overstated sales by shipping products that they knew would be quickly returned or by parking goods marked ''sold'' in warehouses. **********Given management's assurances that the problems were confined to certain brands and involved a limited period, investors were rolling with the punches until the company disclosed on Nov. 6 that the S.E.C. had widened its investigation to look at the way the company was importing shoes from Brazil. ''Many people felt misled,'' said one analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''Management said this was very narrow and confined, but it's not.'' **********The company said in its Nov. 6 salvo that it had received an S.E.C. subpoena on Oct. 29 for documents relating to shoes bought from Brazil since 1994, including information on the prices and customs duties paid for those shoes. **********Mr. Galvin said he continued to believe that any findings by the investigators would not hurt Nine West financially.

But his mood turned to bemusement as he read that the thousands of dollars that he and his wife, Linda, had paid in income taxes for 1990 were not enough. **********The state wanted 37 more cents. **********''I thought the notice was a silly mistake,'' said Mr. Shulman, a former accountant with a major firm who now sells insurance as an independent broker from a midtown Manhattan office. ''The state rounds to the nearest dollar so I wrote them a letter saying the notice must be a mistake and asking them to waive it, and about $70 in penalties and interest, which I thought was absurd, and when they didn't reply I forgot about it.'' **********The state didn't forget. More than two years later a computer churned out a notice demanding the 37 cents plus a penalty that had grown to $216.92 and interest of $53.83. **********Soon the state added a demand for 1994. The Shulmans did not owe any additional tax for 1994, the notice said, but they owed a penalty of $110.80 and interest of $48.82. The notice did not explain why they would owe penalties and interest on no additional tax. **********The amounts grew until earlier this year, when the state wanted $544.53. Plus the 37 cents. **********The tiny tax bill that the state pursued with such vigor illustrates how even a minor tax dispute can turn into a war of correspondence for people who question the authorities rather than just paying up. **********Tax relief was a theme of the elected officials who championed tax bills passed this summer in Albany and Washington. But Mr. Shulman said he would have welcomed a law that eliminated petty rules and provided quick, easy remedies for taxpayers disputing a penalty. **********''It would have been nice if I just could have gotten an explanation from the state of the penalty and how they figured that interest,'' he said. **********Tax penalties are commonplace. Last year more than 20 million penalties were assessed against individuals and couples by the Internal Revenue Service, affecting more than one of every six taxpayers. Those penalties totaled $3.4 billion, equal to more than one-half of 1 percent of all individual income taxes. The I.R.S. has no data on penalties actually paid, only those assessed, said a spokesman, Steve Pyrek. **********New York State has data on penalties actually paid, which totaled $15.1 million in 1995, or less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the nearly $17 billion in state income taxes paid that year. **********In New York State, only the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance or his deputies  can waive a tax, even of a dollar, said Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for the tax agency. However, he added, because no tax bill for less than a dollar is supposed to be sent, low-level tax officials can waive such bills on the theory that the tax does not exist. **********Mr. Quinn said policy changes intended to ease disputes over penalties were on the way, a result of focus group interviews to determine which tax policies irritated people the most. **********Mr. Shulman's battle produced an inch-thick stack of correspondence, much of it his requests for an explanation of the penalty and interest that elicited boilerplate replies from the state reciting the amounts demanded, but without explanation. **********The state later granted Mr. Shulman and his wife amnesty under a program to clean up old tax bills and told the couple to send in a check for $69 to settle the case. But the state sent the same sum back last December, leaving the Shulmans totally perplexed. Then came the $545 bill. **********JAMES W. WETZLER, a former state tax commissioner who is tax group director at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, said the state should apply ''reasonable tolerance levels'' in determining the accuracy of tax returns and overlook amounts that are not worth the state's time. **********Penalties, Mr. Wetzler said, are typically imposed by computer programs and ''are designed to improve voluntary compliance'' with the tax laws. **********A taxpayer like Mr. Shulman could end up owing penalties and interest, but no tax, if he applied for an extension to file a tax return and then discovered that more money was  due when the return was filed, Mr. Wetzler said. ''The state takes the position that to have a valid extension you had to have paid 100 percent of the tax due before the extension would have begun,'' he said. ''So if you fell 37 cents short, the state would say your extension is invalidated and you would owe a nonfiling penalty plus interest on the tax that was paid late and interest on the penalty.'' **********Mr. Shulman said he now believed that this was what happened in his case. But, he asked, ''does it make sense for the state to spend thousands of dollars trying to collect 37 cents or even $100?'' **********''The state should also explain the reasons for its penalties and interest so that anyone can understand,'' he said. ''I'm a certified public accountant and I couldn't figure it out.'' **********In July, after a reporter inquired about the Shulmans' bill, the state advised the couple that it was withdrawing its demand for the 37 cents and penalties and interest, but not taking into account $112 it withheld from his refund in 1995 as partial payment on what started as a 37-cent tax bill. **********Will he try to get back the $112? ''No,'' Mr. Shulman said, breaking into a pained grin. ''I've learned that it's just not worth it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/12/business/chief-is-dismissed-at-centennial-technologies.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-02-12", "snippet": "Centennial Technologies Inc dismisses chairman and chief executive Emmanuel Pinez; begins inquiry into accuracy of company's financial statements (M)", "word_count": 381, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chief Is Dismissed at Centennial Technologies", "print_headline": "Chief Is Dismissed at Centennial Technologies", "body_text": " **********Centennial Technologies Inc., a maker of personal computer equipment whose stock soared last year, said yesterday that it had dismissed its chairman and chief executive, Emanuel Pinez, and had begun an investigation into the accuracy of its financial statements. **********Centennial stock never opened for trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Centennial's investigation will probably require past earnings to be lowered, said J.

Ltd. are just some of the foreign entrants into the saturated market. **********\"Sony is working on reducing its prices to have better results,\" said Y. Kubo, who heads Sony's wholly owned Indian subsidiary. **********The battle for market share in India has driven some of the world's leading brands to craft audacious sales promotions, while competitors are quick to cry foul. **********Early this year, General Electric Co. and its Indian partner, Godrej, took Whirlpool's Indian unit to court to stop it from offering refrigerator and washing machine buyers the chance to win prizes that included an apartment in New Delhi. Invoking an Indian unfair-trade act, Godrej/GE Appliances accused Whirlpool of \"luring gullible consumers\" to buy a refrigerator or washer \"without concern for quality,\" according to a lawyer for Godrej/GE Appliances. The court forced Whirlpool to suspend the plan. **********Meanwhile, judging from refrigerator sales, consumers are not that interested in quality when it comes to having the latest technology available.

''There are the families that destroy each other as soon as the father or  mother dies,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''They come in and tear each other apart. The Gettys or that family in Texas,'' he continued, referring to Harold Simmons, the Texas investor who is at war with his daughters. ''They are all billionaires, and they're fighting like crazy over another billion.'' **********Mr. Roberts has reason to track the way family-run companies pass the baton from one generation to next. He has five children, aged 36 to 47. Only his fourth child, Brian, is at Comcast, the nation's fourth-largest cable television operator with $4 billion in revenue last year. And by the end of this year, the elder Mr. Roberts will increase Brian's control over the company's special class of 8.8 million shares that represent nearly 82 percent of Comcast's vote. It is only natural for the world to wonder: How will Brian's siblings react to all this? **********The potential for conflict is obvious. The Roberts clan's equity stake in Comcast, based in Philadelphia, is worth at least $470 million without a premium, and once the patriarch and his wife pass from the scene, there is no guarantee the heirs won't hurl themselves into a fierce battle for the spoils. **********But the elder Mr. Roberts has probably come as close as any company founder can to setting the stage for an orderly succession. His plan is to turn over the votes to Brian but make sure to divide the financial pie fairly among all the offspring. Though many aging entrepreneurs resist relinquishing power despite all their promises to do so, Comcast has begun notifying local cable commissions of the pending change of control, which Ralph Roberts said would be no later than early next year. **********And experts say the odds of a successful transition are greater at Comcast than at most family businesses. Mr. Roberts has by all accounts done a skillful job of grooming Brian to fill his shoes so that he is both respected by his peers and supported by his siblings. While no one doubts that the father still calls a lot of the shots, he has eased his son into high-profile positions both at the bargaining table and in the public eye. In a family business, even the strongest allegiances can crack under the strain of a mismanaged transition at the top, but people familiar with Comcast say the younger Mr. Roberts is proving his mettle. **********That was evident earlier this month when Brian Roberts and the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, struck a deal in which Microsoft agreed to pay $1 billion for an 11.5 percent stake in Comcast. The deal put the cable company on a far larger corporate map. ''We had 650 analysts on the conference call to discuss the deal,'' recalled Brian Roberts, who handled the call for Comcast. ''Usually we have about 200.'' **********Even as he is promoting his son, the elder Mr. Roberts is looking after the financial interests of his other children. He never pressured any of them to join the family company -- and none besides Brian showed any interest in doing so. Today, Ralph Jr. is a professor of psychology at the University of Denver, and the other three all live near their parents in Philadelphia, where Lisa has a design business, Cathy is involved in philanthropy and Douglas is an assistant District Attorney. **********And all of them are rich. The elder Mr. Roberts has made sure that each of Brian's  siblings will retain an economic stake in Comcast equal their brother's. The five children and their parents jointly own the holding company that owns Comcast's supervoting shares. And to prevent his other heirs  from putting pressure on Brian to sell Comcast -- an issue that has torn many families apart -- Mr. Roberts is struggling with a way to give them nonvoting stock that they could cash in without disturbing their brother's grip on the company. **********''The children -- the family -- have continual discussions,'' he said during an interview in which he was joined by Brian, dressed like his father in a gray suit, black loafers, a white button-down shirt and red print tie. ''It's a pretty close family. Our activities are so public. If you have a small private business, and the old man has stashed away something under the floor, then it's very different.'' **********A few weeks ago, the five Roberts children -- leaving behind both mates and children -- spent a day with their parents for freewheeling talks on everything from personal concerns to financial matters. **********Family-business experts say the family is something of an anomaly in devising a smooth transfer between generations. ''This is a relatively unusual situation,'' said Leon Danco, president of the Center for Family Studies. ''The father is open. Many entrepreneurs are very secretive. It is a sign of a man who has given considerable thought to the future and has spoken to his other children. What is more common is that this kind of agreement does not happen. To make it work, you have to have motivated, competent successors as well as accommodating heirs. If a family has to go to law court to determine what is fair, the issue is what's the law, not what is fair.'' **********IT helps, of course, that only one of the children desperately wanted to follow in  Dad's footsteps. ''I think we have known that Brian would take over the company since he was about 8 years old,'' said Julian Brodsky, Comcast's vice chairman and Mr. Roberts's alter ego for the last 34 years. **********When Brian was 8, Comcast was a fledgling cable operator that Ralph Roberts had founded after jumping in and out of a handful of other businesses. His main goal at the time was to make a lot of money. He had been born into an affluent home, the son of the owner of a small drugstore chain in  Westchester County, N.Y. For a time, the family even had a chauffeur. But during the Depression, Mr. Roberts recalled, ''my father died, and we lost all our money. People who never had a financial problem in their lives can never understand what terror there is in that.'' **********He credits his mother for pulling the family through hard times. ''She had a lot of friends, and she decided to go into the insurance business, and everybody she knew bought a policy from her the first year to keep us going,'' he said. ''We moved into an apartment with my aunt in Philadelphia. I went to the University of Pennsylvania. I lived at home.'' To support himself at college, he took on a variety of odd jobs, including selling milk. **********Once Mr. Roberts began building Comcast, Brian, alone of his brood, frequented the company premises. Luckily, the youngster had business smarts as well as enthusiasm. If he hadn't, his father confesses, ''I probably would have sold the company.'' **********That would have been a wrenching decision, as it almost invariably is for the founder of a company. ''There is something about wanting to pass things on,'' he said. ''It is the same thing as giving birth -- or having another generation. But if Brian were not up to it, he would not have stood a chance because you can't sacrifice all the people in the place for a poor manager.'' **********Or an arrogant one. ''The most dangerous thing is a son or daughter coming into a business where they think they get special treatment,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''They drag the business down because it kills the morale of everybody in the company.'' **********After Brian received an undergraduate business degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1981, Ralph Roberts tried to steer him to another company, where he would have to fight his own battles. But the son wanted to stay in the family business, so Mr. Roberts started him off in the trenches, stringing cable in New Kensington, Pa. ''We were lucky because the cable business was growing and growing, '' Mr. Roberts recalled. There was plenty of room to give the son a shot. **********But as Brian Roberts worked his way up the ladder, the halcyon 1980's came to an end. The 1990's have been far tougher, as regulation and skepticism about the industry's future in the face of rival technologies hurt cable stocks. Like many other cable companies, Comcast peaked in late 1993, at $28.17 a share. It bottomed out at $16.375 last March and has recovered slightly, closing at $21.375 on Friday on Nasdaq. **********ALL along, however, Mr. Roberts has drawn his son closer to the center of action inside Comcast and pushed him into the spotlight outside the company. ''I thought if he was so young, you really have to be helped to be promoted to make it appear that you really are your own person,'' the elder Mr. Roberts recalled. ''Every chance I get I step back and say, 'Here is Brian.' I didn't want it to appear that he was just his father's son.'' **********For example, it was Brian Roberts who was on the board of Turner Broadcasting before Time Warner bought it in 1996, and it was Brian who was president of the National Cable Television Association's board in 1995. **********Promoting an heir apparent may have been easier for the elder Mr. Roberts than for other entrepreneurs. Investors who know him say he always prefers to remain in the background and let others like Mr.Brodsky, the vice chairman, take the limelight. ''I used to talk to Julian all the time,'' recalled Gordon Crawford, a senior vice president at the Capital Group, whose funds hold 8.1 percent of Comcast's class A stock. ''I would see Ralph about once a year.'' **********Brian Roberts, on the other hand, seems to relish his public role. ''He gives more speeches than anyone who is asked,'' said one media executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''But if it were not for self-promotion, how would a guy like Bill Gates take him seriously?'' **********Brian Roberts came to know Mr. Gates when a contingent of Comcast executives visited Microsoft on a fact-finding tour several years ago. They have met at the investment bank Allen & Company's annual Sun Valley Conference for media heavyweights, and they got together last summer when Mr. Gates came to speak at a United Way fund-raising event in Philadelphia. **********The recent deal was begun when the executive committee of Cablelabs, the cable industry's research and development arm that included Brian Roberts and John Malone, chairman of Tele-Communications Inc., the country's largest cable operator, visited Microsoft in late April. **********Mr. Gates told the group he believed the cable industry had been slow to upgrade its systems. Brian Roberts countered that other companies, including Comcast, were aggressively upgrading. Later, the two men found themselves in the same restaurant, and Mr. Roberts suggested that Microsoft consider investing in cable. Mr. Gates was warm to the idea. A result was Microsoft's $1 billion investment in Comcast. **********As Gregory B. Maffei, Microsoft's treasurer, sees it, the younger Mr. Roberts is no pawn of his father. On the contrary, he says, ''Brian takes the lead and is the one forging ahead and trying to figure out where they are going,'' Mr. Maffei said. ''Brian is the more active participant.'' **********And Peter Barton, the former president of Liberty Media, recalled that Brian Roberts played the key role in a complicated deal with Liberty involving the purchase of Time Warner's stake in E Entertainment, a cable-service company, for $321 million. Brian brought in the Walt Disney Company to put up most of the funds for the acquisition, even though Comcast management gained effective control of E Entertainment. **********''Deals like Microsoft and QVC would not have happened without Brian,'' said Steven Rattner, deputy chief executive of Lazard Freres & Company, who has worked with the family for about a decade. ''Ralph and Julian have been intimately involved, but Ralph doesn't sit there until 4 A.M. in the lawyers' offices anymore. Now Brian typically takes the lead.'' **********To be sure, he adds, ''At an important fork in the road, Brian will go off to his father'' to get the older man's stamp of approval. **********The company is clearly planning for the day that Ralph Roberts will no longer be running the show. Over the last five years, it has brought in a younger team of senior executives to work with Brian, including the executive vice president, Larry Smith, 49; the senior treasurer, John Alchin, 49, and  the president of the cable division, Tom Baxter, 50. **********The son, meanwhile, remains an understudy of the father -- and the father is impressing upon the son the need to play hardball when the occasion demands it. **********In 1994, for example, Ralph Roberts scuttled a bid by Barry Diller, then the chairman of QVC, the home-shopping cable channel, to acquire CBS. The deal would have relegated Comcast, the biggest QVC shareholder, to be a minor, and passive, investor in CBS, and the elder Mr. Roberts wanted no part of that. So he made his own bid for QVC, with TCI as a partner, effectively killing the CBS deal. **********The memory of the fiasco still rankles Mr. Diller. ''Ralph is tough,'' he says ruefully. ''Under that bow tie and courtly manner beats the heart of one tough man. He is steel.'' **********Ralph Roberts acknowledges that he was the heavy. ''I was probably the one to pull the curtain,'' he said. ''Barry is very charismatic and hypnotic, but we were not going to lose our business and become a nonvoting stockholder of CBS to provide Barry with an entree to CBS.'' Then, chuckling, he added, ''It was probably a very good lesson for Brian -- no question about it.'' **********The son got the point. His father's greatest skill, he said, ''is the ability to make the hard decision at the crucial moment.'' **********Once the elder Mr. Roberts is out of the picture at Comcast, Wall Street will be watching closely to see whether the son can be as tough and decisive as his father. It is a skill that Brian Roberts knows he has yet to prove and that is rare among the sons of powerful men, who are often overwhelmed by their fathers. **********''It has been wonderful to share those tense moments with your father,'' Brian Roberts said, ''and hopefully, it has prepared me for the future.'' **********Brian Roberts acknowledges that decision making, what he calls ''pulling the trigger,'' is something you learn. ''Hopefully, I have had more experience than most people,'' he said, ''but you never know.'' **********At least Comcast has the financial flexibility to make the transition work. Like many media entrepreneurs, Ralph Roberts created several classes of stock, enabling him to issue equity without losing control. In 1963, the year he founded the company, he created Comcast class B shares, of which there are 8.8 million, each with 15 votes. The company also has 33 million shares of common stock with one vote each and 284 million K shares with no votes. The family holding company owns all the supervoting shares, as well as 1.8 million of the class A shares and 5.3 million of the nonvoting shares. In addition, Ralph Roberts personally owns another 5.2 million nonvoting shares, as well as 319,00 class A shares. **********JUST as important, family-business experts say the apparent harmony within the Roberts family bodes well for the chances of a smooth transition. Mr. Roberts has been married to his wife, Suzanne, for 54 years. And the other children, who declined to be interviewed, are said to be knowledgeable about the plan and favorable to it. **********''All this would never have happened in the arms of a second wife,'' according to Mr. Danco. ''When some guy decides that he is so important that he dismisses Mama for some 35-year-old trophy, then I don't know what is fair. There are too many other combatants, and it becomes another deal. This has a pretty good chance of working. It is the mother who will make it work.'' **********Both parents said that in bringing up their brood, they worked hard to see that the children connected with one another. ''We never emphasized that they should make a lot of money, or have the biggest car,'' Mrs. Roberts recalled. And her husband reminisced about family trips. ''We used to take the children away with us every year to climb the Pyramids or something memorable to keep their attention,'' he said. ''We would have discussions about our lives. They were like mass therapy sessions with the children.'' **********That was hardly a coincidence. When she was 60 years old, Mrs. Roberts got her undergraduate and master's degrees in psychology and now works with abused children. **********Without being asked, Mrs. Roberts volunteered her opinion that Ralph and Brian clicked as few business partners do. ''I have never seen a relationship that could surpass the two of them,'' she said. ''I don't think Ralph knows any more about Brian's personal life than he knows about the others. But they talk all the time. It is always business. And if there is any disagreement, they can always talk it out. It is amazing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/08/business/business-digest-507369.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1997-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 549, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Stocks Rise, Led by Rally In Technology Shares **********Stocks began this week on a far more upbeat note than the last.

Gandhi's ashes, long left forgotten in a provincial bank vault. **********For a few hours, this city was host to events that seemed borrowed from the days after a Hindu nationalist assassinated Gandhi in New Delhi on Jan. 30, 1948. **********Sealed in the wooden coffin where they had been placed after being scooped from Gandhi's funeral pyre, the ashes were taken from a special railroad car, honored by crowds of young and old shouting, ''Long Live the Mahatma!'' and poured from an urn into the Ganges to the sound of ancient Hindu death chants. **********The ceremony on the river came at a time of intense Indian debate over Gandhi. Among the thousands who lined the streets and the riverbank here today, and millions of other Indians, he is still revered. But many say that his legacy has been mocked by events in India since he died, and that the country urgently needs to look anew at his vision for the country he led to nationhood. **********As India approaches the 50th anniversary of its independence from Britain on Aug. 15, many have been unhappily scrutinizing the country they live in for evidence of Gandhi's ideals -- among others, nonviolence, religious harmony, concern for those trapped by poverty and caste, and a life free of materialism. **********These people point to India's covert nuclear weapons program, to soaring rates of crime and corruption, to political parties that appeal to divisions of religion, region and caste, and above all to the 350 million Indians who still live in poverty and conditions of endemic disease. **********''We invoke Gandhi today as the Mahatma, the Father of the Nation,'' said Vandita Mishra, a columnist writing last weekend in The Pioneer, a leading newspaper. ''But the politician and social philosopher who articulated an alternative model of society is, by a curious sleight of memory and imagination, transformed into the presiding deity of a system that negates every conviction he stood for.'' **********Ms. Mishra's article was one of a torrent in Indian papers recently deploring what has been described as the country's passion for celebrating Gandhi in speeches, statues and books, and ignoring almost everything he taught. Many of these articles have also condemned some of the more radical figures among India's new generation of political leaders for using Gandhi as a political football, often denigrating him and, his followers say, distorting his ideas. **********One of India's most vociferous politicians, a woman who uses the single name Mayawati, has condemned him as ''the biggest enemy'' of the 150 million people who belong to the dalit, or untouchable, caste. **********Gandhi's prescription for untouchables -- that untouchability should be abolished, but that dalits should unite with Hindus of other castes in working for broad reform -- was strongly contested in his lifetime by untouchable leaders who believed dalits should band together as a separate political force. But the arguments of Gandhi's day rarely had the venom of the recent ones. **********Arousing just as much controversy have been the attacks on Gandhi by Hindu nationalists. Although never fully recovered politically from the fact that one of their followers, Nathuram Godse, killed Gandhi, they seem to have felt freer in recent years to challenge his legacy. **********Balasaheb Thackeray, a nationalist who is the most powerful political leader in Bombay, suggested this month that Gandhi's habit of testing his asceticism by sleeping in the same bed with naked young women may not have been as innocent as Gandhi said. He also challenged the habit of referring to Gandhi as Father of the Nation. ''At the most,'' Mr. Thackeray said, ''he could be India's son.'' **********Some leaders have even suggested that Gandhi erred by pressing for independence too soon. One of India's foremost Islamic scholars, Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, has said independence should have waited until India -- whose current literacy rate is about 60 percent -- had a better-educated electorate. **********''Gandhi and his followers perceived the British as the source of all evil,'' Mr. Khan said. ''They believed if they threw the British out, they could usher in an evil-free society. But people of my generation will agree that the India of 1947 was a better India. There was peace, prosperity and brotherhood.'' **********Partly, the ceremony today was a matter of unfinished family business, organized by a descendant of India's independence leader, Tushar Gandhi, 36, a graphic designer in Bombay. He learned from a report in The Times of India three years ago that a wooden coffin said to contain some of the ashes of his great-grandfather had been discovered in a branch of the State Bank of India in Cuttack, on the eastern coast. **********After months of hearings last year, the Supreme Court authenticated the ashes as having come from the division that was made at the funeral pyre of Gandhi, who was cremated atop a pile of sandalwood beside the Yamuna River in New Delhi. **********At least a score of urns were filled from the ashes and distributed across India for immersion in the country's rivers, but the urn sent to Orissa state, for reasons that remain obscure, ended up in the bank at Cuttack, which was Orissa's state capital at the time of Gandhi's assassination. **********In the absence of any explanation from government or bank officials in Orissa, several theories have been advanced to explain why the ashes were left in the bank. One is that the Orissa government at the time planned to build a memorial to Gandhi, then forgot about the ashes when the memorial project was dropped. Another is that the ashes were simply overlooked in the confusion that developed in 1950 when the state capital of Orissa was moved from Cuttack to Bubaneshwar, on the Bay of Bengal coast. **********As much as the Gandhi family -- which is not related to the Gandhi political dynasty -- wanted to give its famous forebear ''a final measure of peace,'' as Tushar Gandhi put it today, the ceremony in Allahabad, an ancient holy site, also made a political statement. **********Many Indians who revere Gandhi believe that the neglect of his ashes merely reflects the decline in his relevance since independence. **********The sense of alienation from his ideals was not eased when today's ceremonies were held without any of the country's best-known figures. Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda stayed in New Delhi, an hour's flight away, and instead sent a Communist Party leader, Chaturanan Mishra, who is Agriculture Minister in the 14-party coalition Government. The top leadership of the Congress Party, which Gandhi led for three decades, was also absent, represented by a local leader from Uttar Pradesh state, where Allahabad is situated. **********As he greeted local dignitaries visiting a tented enclosure in Allahabad where the ashes lay in state today, Tushar Gandhi said politicians in New Delhi had shown their pettiness by staying away. **********''The political atmosphere in India is so vitiated these days that our leaders calculate everything according to a narrow scale of gain,'' he said, adding that he thought leaders feared Gandhi. ''His very memory is a reproach to lack of leadership and vision.'' **********Among ordinary Indians, matters seemed different. Thousands lined up in the morning sun to throw marigold and rose petals on the coffin, or to cheer as it passed by. **********Government officials, citing a Supreme Court ruling in November that the ashes be disposed of ''with dignity and honor,'' had blocked Tushar Gandhi's plan to display the urn on a road tour through north Indian states. Instead, they had ordered the ashes to be taken from the Cuttack bank to a train, guarded by a heavily armed contingent of the army's Rapid Action Force and carried directly to Allahabad. **********When a launch bearing the coffin reached a floating platform at the point where the Ganges converges with the Yamuna, there were moments that captured some of the hope Gandhi engendered as he crisscrossed India. A large crowd of pilgrims, breaking away from the soul-cleansing dips that draw millions of Hindus to Allahabad, waded waist-deep into the water and burst into a chant. **********''As long as the sun and the moon rise,'' they cried, ''so will your name live, Mahatma!'' **********A lone Hindu holy man, naked except for a saffron-colored wrap, stood silent in the water hoisting a sign demanding an end to one of the practices Gandhi condemned. **********''Dowry-giving is a sin!'' the sign read, referring to the habit, common despite constitutional proscription, of grooms' families' demanding payment from brides. **********A middle-aged woman, serene on a sandbar with her royal blue bathing wrap blowing in the breeze, waved a lonely farewell. **********Whether the ceremony would have pleased Gandhi is a matter of dispute. Although he was an ardent Hindu, he asked that his death ceremonies be kept to a minimum. But Tushar Gandhi thought he might have accepted the rite as a means of stirring debate in India about his ideals. **********''What would the Mahatma have disapproved of in today's India?'' Tushar Gandhi asked. ''What would he not have disapproved of? The caste-ism, the religious divide, the materialism, the aping of the West -- all this he would have found reprehensible. He would be a very disappointed man.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/14/business/chairman-resigns-at-dai-ichi-kangyo-bank.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-06-14", "snippet": "Tadashi Okuda resigns as chairman of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank after he 'suddenly' remembers knowing that scandal-ridden bank made loans to suspected racketeer; two bank executives are arrested, joining several others charged in recent weeks; Katsuyuki...", "word_count": 226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chairman Resigns at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank", "print_headline": "Chairman Resigns at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank", "body_text": " **********The chairman of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. stepped down today after he ''suddenly remembered'' knowing that the scandal-ridden bank had made loans to a suspected racketeer, the company said. **********He is the latest executive to lose his job in a scandal over loans to corporate blackmailers that has left the president of the Nomura Securities Company under arrest and has forced the resignations of top executives of Dai-Ichi Kangyo. **********A Dai-Ichi Kangyo vice president and an executive managing director were arrested today, the most senior of 10 officers and former employees who have been arrested in the last two weeks. **********Katsuyuki Sugita, who will become the bank's president as part of an effort to restore its tarnished image, announced at a late night news conference that the bank's chairman, Tadashi Okuda, had resigned. **********Mr. Sugita said he asked Mr. Okuda to leave after the chairman said he remembered knowing that the bank had lent money to Rikiya Kijima, a suspected racketeer.

But a person familiar with the details of the contract characterized the $30 million sum as too high. **********The only financial element divulged by the company was its donation of $1 million to Mr. Woods's charitable foundation, to benefit junior golf for minorities. **********''That touched my heart,'' Mr. Woods said during a conference call. **********Aligning with American Express catapults Mr. Woods from the hard-core sports business into a broader role as a corporate spokesman. He currently has five-year endorsement contracts, with Nike, for $40 million, and Titleist, the leading golf ball maker, for $20 million. Both were signed shortly after Mr. Woods turned professional last August. **********''In Tiger Woods, we have a representative who has captured the imagination of many different kinds of people,'' Kenneth I. Chenault, the president of American Express, said during the conference call. He said the traits that characterized Mr. Woods -- ''discipline, hard work and preparation'' -- are the pillars of our business.'' **********American Express intends to associate its card, traveler's checks and financial services with the many allures of Mr. Woods: a wealthy, successful young man, with a multi-ethnic background and the longest drives on the P.G.A. Tour. **********''It's hard to visualize anyone he wouldn't appeal to,'' Mr. Chenault said. **********H. Spencer Nilson, the publisher of the Nilson Report, which tracks the credit and charge card industry, agreed, saying: ''This is a coup. There is no one in the world entirely like him.'' **********Not even Michael Jordan, Mr. Woods's sibling as a Nike endorser? ''He's older, he's fading,'' Mr. Nilson said. ''Here's a young, popular person you can use for years. It's positioning yourself with a leader.'' **********Peter Lucas, a senior editor of Card Marketing magazine, said Mr. Woods gave American Express ''an icon to market to potential card holders.'' He also said that Mr. Woods was already a global personality who could be used to market American Express's products in South America and Asia, where growth exists in golf and credit cards. **********Currently, Visa is the leader in the  card market, holding a 46.6 percent market share in total spending, with $308.7 billion in 1996, according to the Nilson Report. Mastercard's $172.6 billion gave it a 26.1 percent market share. American Express's $129.6 billion gave it a 19.6 percent share. **********Mr. Woods and American Express have discussed their affiliation since last December, but they announced the agreement one day after Mr. Woods won the GTE Byron Nelson Classic by two strokes and one month after he won the Masters by a stunning 12. After only 16 tournaments as a professional, and five triumphs, he has won $2.08 million. **********Mr. Chenault said the initial thrust of American Express's marketing with Mr. Woods would involve the company's financial advisory services. (Mr. Woods will add an American Express adviser to a cadre of people tending to his money.) **********Mr. Wood's role will subsequently embrace the credit-card business, which the company is best known for and which has been most widely advertised. The first spot in the Woods campaign is scheduled to go on the air in the third quarter of the year. **********Mr. Woods said that the American Express endorsement was part of a well-defined vision, developed with the help of his father, Earl, and his agent, Hughes Norton of the International Management Group, for how to market himself. ''We had already developed a brand plan that encompasses who I am,'' Mr. Woods said. ''American Express isn't going to branch off into areas where we're in conflict. So I'm going to be promoted in the way I hope to be perceived.''  Other card companies made offers, Mr. Woods said, but he felt at ease with American Express. Brandweek reported that Mastercard had made a bid that included $2.3 million upfront. **********Mr. Lucas said that losing the Tiger sweepstakes to American Express might crimp Mastercard's efforts to further market and promote its golf sponsorship interests. **********Ed Dixon, a Mastercard spokesman, said he would not discuss any talks with Mr. Woods. Kelly Presta, a Visa spokesman, said that company had not pursued Mr. Woods."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/07/business/dow-adds-130-putting-1997-gain-near-1000-points.html": {"writer_name": "David Barboza", "pub_date": "1997-06-07", "snippet": "Dow Jones industrial average soars 130.49 points, or 1.8 percent, to close at record 7,435.78 on June 6; graph (M)\u00ff", "word_count": 973, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Adds 130, Putting 1997 Gain Near 1,000 Points", "print_headline": "Dow Adds 130, Putting 1997 Gain Near 1,000 Points", "body_text": " **********In yet another display of the market's seemingly bottomless store of euphoria, stock prices surged again yesterday, lifting most of the major indexes to new records. **********Heavy demand for blue-chip stocks and fresh signs that the economy remains robust, but with few signs of inflation, have buoyed a stock market that continues to baffle even seasoned analysts. **********The Dow Jones industrial average soared 130.49 points, or 1.8 percent, to close at a record 7,435.78 -- leaving the index just 13 points shy of a 1,000-point gain this year. **********In fact, in just over five months, the Dow  has climbed more than 15 percent, giving investors and Wall Street a great deal to cheer about. **********''It's been one heck of a year,'' said A. Marshall Acuff, a market analyst at Smith Barney. ''There were many years in history when people would have been glad to take 15 percent.'' **********The rally yesterday was fueled in part by the bond market, where prices jumped and yields plunged after the Government released data showing that payrolls rose less than had been expected last month, even as the unemployment rate fell to a 23-year low. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.77 percent, its lowest level since late February, from 6.88 percent on Thursday. **********Bond prices initially slipped yesterday morning on concerns that the unemployment data would be ominous for debt securities. But bond prices soared later, sending the market to one of its best one-day performances this year, partly because just 138,000 jobs were created last month, down from 323,000 in April. **********The financial markets were also buoyed by reports that European monetary union might be delayed, primarily because of weakness in Germany, where new data show a surge in unemployment. The dollar hit its highest level against the German mark in nearly three and a half years -- 1.7423 marks -- before settling back in New York at 1.7258 marks, down from 1.7288 Thursday. The dollar also ended down against the Japanese yen at 114.60, compared with 115.72 on Thursday. **********But longer term, analysts said, uncertainty in Europe could create stronger demand for the dollar, which is considered a highly stable currency; in contrast, the foreign-exchange market has grown increasingly skeptical that the planned European currency, the euro, will be strong. All of these factors should mean greater foreign demand for American securities, according to analysts. **********While investors viewed the European developments favorably and the payroll data as benign, some analysts said yesterday's rally had less to do with such particular events and more to do with investors' seemingly boundless desire for stocks. **********''Confidence is running high, mutual fund inflows are strong and investors want to own stocks,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief equity strategist at Gruntal & Company. ''That's because the economy is strong enough to yield better-than-expected earnings but not enough for the Fed to raise rates.'' **********Among the indexes setting records yesterday was the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, which rose 14.58 points, to 858.01. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks also peaked, up 2.15 points, to 387.14. **********It has been that kind of year for the stock market. After two years in which the Dow gained more than 20 percent, few analysts expected stocks to play an encore. **********But the market has foiled most bearish soothsayers. Despite a nearly 10 percent drop that ended in mid-April, blue-chip issues have racked up enviable returns. For example, shares of Wal-Mart are up 38 percent for the year; Coca-Cola, 29 percent, and Microsoft, 50 percent. **********One reason large-capitalization stocks keep sizzling is that investors, continuing to see the global companies as safe bets, ride the wave of momentum buying out of fear that they will miss out on a big rally. **********''There's pressure for performance,'' said Richard E. Cripps, a market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. ''We have more capital that wants to get into the market, and we have few good stock ideas.'' **********Among the strong sectors, financial issues, like banks and brokerage houses, are booming, with the S.& P. financials index up 20 percent this year. And drug stocks are doing even better; the Amex pharmaceuticals index has gained 25 percent. **********More impressive, though, are the broad market gains that have taken place in recent weeks. Small-  and mid-capitalization stocks are now in growing demand. **********Yesterday, advancing issues outnumbered those declining by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. And program trading, often a sizable factor when the Dow gains more than 100 points, played a smaller role yesterday, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. **********Still, yesterday's performance was dominated by blue-chip issues. Within the Dow, 29 of the average's 30-component stocks rose yesterday, led by Procter & Gamble, up 3, to 136 1/4; Merck up 3, to 92 1/4, and J. P. Morgan, which gained 2 3/4, to 111 1/2. **********Yesterday's run-up was the ninth time this year that the Dow has gained more than 100 points in a day. Recently, however, the Dow has been less volatile. For the week, the Dow gained 104.74 points, or 1.4 percent. **********The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index also rose yesterday, climbing 14.79 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 1,404.84. The index has gained 8.8 percent this year but has lagged behind recently, partly because of Intel's announcement that second-quarter earnings would be disappointing. **********Despite the market's spectacular gains this year, many analysts continue to caution investors that a significant slump could lie ahead. The ''wolf'' is not at the door, Mr. Acuff at Smith Barney said, but that is of little solace to a longtime market watcher. **********''The market, to put it mildly, is historically high,'' he said.

''The Europeans and the Japanese are there.'' Counseling creative patience on human rights matters, he said, ''I would not let that one issue become the veto issue.'' **********But half a block from Mr. Jiang's meeting with Mr. Wang and 30 other local Chinese-American leaders at Blair House, vocal dissidents will mass in Lafayette Park to focus on human rights, not economic opportunity, as the prime issue of the China leader's visit with President Clinton. **********''We have been stripped of our nationality and forced to become stateless international refugees,'' Liu Binyan, a celebrated victim of Beijing's intolerance, said on the eve of a protest that will echo with the grievances of the brutal crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy protest eight years ago. **********Daphne Kwok is one Chinese-American activist who will be studiously ignoring human rights and economic issues as her focal point. ''I'm monitoring how the visit may or may not play into the campaign finance issue,'' said Ms. Kwok, devoted in her role as director of the Organization of Chinese Americans. **********She says her group has 10,000 members and a sense of absolute outrage at the ''systematic stereotyping'' of Asian-American citizens in the investigations into alleged political fund-raising abuses by foreign-born donors. **********''This is the real issue for Chinese-Americans,'' she said. ''Here we are in 1997 with a major feeling, tolerated among the American public, that it is O.K. to make fun and stereotype Americans who have Chinese features.'' **********Darting somewhere between Blair House and the park protest will be Norman Fu, United States correspondent for China Times, a Taiwan newspaper, taking notes as a reporter fascinated by President Jiang's presence here as ''a paradoxical figure'' who has had a classical education but a ''callous'' rise to power. **********''What is no less interesting is my impression that there may be more Americans than Chinese-Americans opposed to his visit because of the human rights issue.'' **********Beyond these individuals, the mood among the 1.7 million Americans of Chinese ancestry about President Jiang's arrival can be found ranging from the blase to the prideful. **********''I'm kind of ambivalent,'' said Wu-Lang Lee, a Federal economist unstirred by the media drumbeat. **********''It's a routine matter to me,'' said Mr. Lee, a Taiwan-born American who cares deeply about the security of Taiwan but expects President Clinton to win no great reassurances in that regard. **********And pride? Shu-Ping Chan, a community relations specialist with the government of Maryland, insisted: ''Listen, even among my friends who work for the Taiwan Government I'm finding political differences put aside. There's a bit of lingering pride that the Chinese Government is being recognized as a coequal. This is a chance for China to shine -- that's what I'm sensing.'' **********Studying these facets and more, American scholars like Marshall Bouton, vice president of the Asia Society, find Chinese-Americans feeling ''whipsawed,'' as he put it, by the Chinese leader's visit. There is a distinct sense of welcome, but wariness, too, that the visit might somehow redound negatively on them by feeding controversies like the foreign-money campaign inquiry. **********''The visit is and ought to be a very welcome development in putting U.S-China relations back on an even keel after the very traumatic Tiananmen events,'' Mr. Bouton said. ''Many in the community felt the trauma personally. But there was also that sort of shudder, if you will, at the tendency in our history for the Chinese community to be victimized when state relations turn sour.'' **********Just a mile from all the toasting and protesting about President Jiang, Duane Wang, Shanghai-born and an American for four decades, intends to stay busy all week at his lumberyard in Washington's Chinatown. **********''It all depends on where you're from and when you got here,'' was his summary of Chinese-American views. ''I speak as an American. I find the visit a good thing because China is a very old country, and since Nixon opened it up, it has changed tremendously, even in human rights.'' **********''Think of it this way: if it hadn't been opened up, there would have been no Tiananmen Square,'' said Mr. Wang, his faith in time and China strong. ''President Jiang will learn. He will find out our system is good, and he will go home with a different attitude.'' **********Others are not so sure. **********''Personally, I think business will be foremost with President Clinton in the visit, not human rights, and I don't agree with that,'' said the Rev. Samuel Yau, pastor of the Chinese Christian Church of Greater Washington, which serves 350 Americans from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in nearby Silver Spring, Md. **********Mr. Yau finds no special discussion or protest this week among his hard-working parishioners. He speaks of the campaign inquiry issue not as an outraged Chinese-American, but as as an American with faith in the political system. ''I don't worry about the fund-raising charges,'' he said. ''The system is very much stable in our country.'' **********G. Greg Chen, a worker here in the Mayor's office, earns his living tracking and celebrating the grand disparity of views about China within Chinatown, but also fathoming the relative ignorance of non-Chinese Americans about his birthplace. He hopes the visit will ease both the simplistic ''Communist dragon'' image of China and local anxiety over racist stereotyping. **********''We have lots of people contributing to their new country,'' Mr. Chen said.

For instance, in South Africa it is twice as high among Tswana as among Zulu, she said, because Tswana encourage marriage between cousins while Zulu forbid it. **********Estimates for Zimbabwe vary. One done early last year found that 1 schoolchild in 4,700 was albino. An earlier one found nearly twice that rate in Harare. **********Albinism comes from a recessive gene and must be inherited from both parents. Not all children in affected families are albino. Mr. Nyathi, for example, has two albino siblings, while his parents and eight other siblings are black. **********The condition may skip generations, reappearing to cause confusion and ruin marriages. **********Lloyd Thuchila, a pipe fitter, said his father had left his mother shortly after he was born. ''He said, 'Why do I have to be the one with an albino child?' '' Mr. Thuchila said. '' 'No one in my family has an albino.' '' **********Professor Makumbe, who is married to a black woman and has three black children, said that when his first child was born, one of his colleagues at the University of Zimbabwe asked if the baby was ''black, white or colored.'' **********''He's a physicist,'' Mr. Makumbe said. ''He should know better.'' **********Many men accuse their wives of infidelity when albinos are born. Some even accuse them of having had sex with a tokolosh, a devil's imp who is said to be produced by witchcraft from a tree root and to live under beds. **********Superstitions are strong in rural Zimbabwe. The practice of killing suspected witches survives, and albino children were once smothered at birth. The belief that adult albinos do not die, but simply vanish, is still widely held. **********There is also a lingering belief that albinism is somehow contagious. Many Africans admit to spitting when they see an albino, to ward off the ''spell.'' At parties, Mr. Gunda said, people hesitate to shake his hand. Some albinos say they bring their own food on group outings to avoid embarrassing incidents. **********''When my nephew got a rash when he was 18,'' Professor Makumbe recalled, ''my own sister said, 'You must have got this from your Uncle John.' '' **********Professor Kromberg said surveys she had done among young albino adults in Soweto, South Africa, found that they were rarely shunned on buses or in the classroom but did have much lower marriage rates and believed that they would have difficulty finding work. She said she had come across anecdotal evidence that black children were reluctant to share food with albino classmates. **********More disturbingly, she said studies she had done in the 1980's found that mothers of albino children took about nine months to accept them fully.  ''They keep a distance that's not normal between mother and child, and talk to them less,'' she said. **********She conceded that discrimination might be worse in other African countries. For 25 years she and a social worker have been visiting clinics and reminding nurses to explain to people that the condition is genetic ''and not caused by witchcraft or by the mother drinking orange Fanta during pregnancy or by laughing at an albino or other things people believe,'' she said. **********Many albinos have developed a bitter humor about their lot. Twice in the 1970's during the war against the old white regime, Mr. Nyathi was almost shot by guerrillas who took him for a white man. He was very funny as he described walking home from a rural bus stop and seeing three soldiers leap up from behind a bush, pulling back their rifle bolts, then halting in astonishment when he started shouting at them in Ndebele, the language of southern Zimbabwe. ''Oh, look, he's an African,'' they said. ''Sorry, brother, sorry!'' **********Sibongile Chitiyo, a 27-year-old albino studying social work at the University of Zimbabwe, said she could judge a man's feelings for her by his behavior in public. ''If people ask who I am, and he says 'Oh, she's my sister,' then I know he's ashamed,'' she said. **********Mr. Nyathi, 36, Mr. Gunda, 33, and Mr. Thuchila, 24, met in the library of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently and talked about the difficulties of doing ordinary things like dating and looking for jobs. The day-to-day discrimination that albinos face sounded hauntingly like that suffered by black Americans. **********Mr. Gunda recalled how the mother of ''the first girl I wanted to marry'' declared, ''I will commit suicide if I have an albino son-in-law.'' **********All three men mentioned having co-workers who were friendly at work but avoided them socially. **********Mr. Nyathi described job interviews he had set up by phone, and the shock and confusion of the interviewers when he walked in. ''You know you have failed before you start talking,'' he said. **********Several times as the men spoke, ministry employees came around the bookshelves that hid Mr. Nyathi's desk. Each one started at the sight of several white-skinned men, and retreated, apologizing. **********Mr. Nyathi smiled ruefully and reflected on the peculiar shame that discrimination creates in those who must face it. ''Albinos tend to unconsciously avoid each other,'' he said. ''If I see another albino on a bus, I won't go stand next to him. Other people will assume he's my brother or something. But you look at each other, and you both have this sense of, 'They're on to us.' '' **********All three men did well in school, despite vision problems. The genetic differences that cause albinism also change the connections between the optic nerves and the brain. Many albinos have nystagmus -- ''dancing eyeballs'' -- and myopia that, even with thick glasses, can only be corrected to about 20-200. **********''Albinos seem more intelligent because they try harder,'' Mr. Nyathi said. ''You have to get out of your seat, go up to the board, squint, write two sentences, go back, and still finish the test in the same time as the others.'' **********Dr. Kromberg said her intelligence studies had confirmed that. ''Albinos have normal I.Q.'s but a higher capability,'' she said. ''I think it's because they don't play in the sun all day. They stay inside and do their homework.'' **********But poverty and discrimination often hold them back. **********Mr. Thuchila was a good student but could not afford glasses. He became a pipe fitter in a Government motor depot but had to give up the job because the oils on the lathes he used damaged his fragile skin. His bosses, he said, would not give him a different job, or one he could do with gloves on. **********For those who do poorly in school, there is even less hope. ''It's pretty common to see an albino with a little bowl, begging on the street,'' Professor Makumbe said. **********His trust is seeking outside money, but without much success. ''Foreign embassies usually say, 'Give us a development project, not charity,' '' Mr. Thuchila said. **********At Christmas the Mayor's office gave $500, an anonymous donor, $300. Johnson & Johnson's local subsidiary donated 50 small bottles of sunscreen lotion and some toothbrushes. **********John Chinyandura, a 48-year-old unemployed albino who asked Professor Makumbe to pull together the rights group, knows what he would do if there was more money. **********He said he would go on speaking trips throughout Zimbabwe, ''to tell people that we are the same blood -- that we are people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/09/business/olivetti-predicts-yet-another-loss.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1997-05-09", "snippet": "Olivetti SpA predicts it will have first-half loss of 264.2 billion lire ($155 million) before taxes and before accounting for its cellular phone unit Omnitel (S)", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Olivetti Predicts Yet Another Loss", "print_headline": "Olivetti Predicts Yet Another Loss", "body_text": " **********Olivetti S.p.A. forecast yesterday that it would a have first-half loss of 264.2 billion lire ($155 million) before taxes and before accounting for its cellular phone unit Omnitel. **********Roberto Colaninno, chief executive of Olivetti, the Italian office products company, said at an analysts meeting yesterday that he saw a loss of 93 billion lire in the second quarter alone. **********The first-half loss brings company's losses since 1990 to 4.1 trillion lire and comes months after a series of turbulent management changes and the sale of its troubled personal computer division.

They address virtually every policy and practice that has attracted the interest of Federal investigators or drawn public criticism in recent months. **********According to the internal documents, the plan would involve ''a total change in the culture'' of Columbia. The company would take these steps: ***********Sell its home health care business, which along with Columbia's hospitals is being examined to determine whether its expenses were fraudulently inflated in reports filed for Government reimbursement. ***********Eliminate all cash-bonus programs, which were designed to encourage employees to meet financial targets and other corporate goals but which were criticized as an incentive to cut corners. ***********Adopt new programs to insure that employees comply with all laws and regulations, and significantly increase its enforcement staff. ***********Abandon its practice of selling interests in hospitals to its doctors and buy out those who already hold such investments; these stakes have been widely criticized for creating conflicts of interest for doctors. **********Some changes address even small details of the company's culture. For example, according to the internal documents, Columbia will eliminate the use of ''scorecards'' that have been annually distributed to all employees, pinpointing the amounts of revenue in various categories that Columbia's senior executives wanted the hospital managers to obtain. That change is part of an effort to end the company's ''short-term profit orientation,'' the documents say. **********Parts of the plan, which has not yet been publicly announced, were said to have been presented yesterday by lawyers for Columbia to Justice Department officials involved in the investigation of the company. **********Indeed, many of the plan's elements are apparently intended to smooth Columbia's relationship with Federal authorities. In an effort to be viewed as more cooperative, under the new plan Columbia would open its files to Federal law enforcement agents, giving the Government access to all compliance programs, as well as to reports of expenses filed to the Government, laboratory billing records and other documents that are at the center of the growing criminal investigation. The company has been fighting Government efforts to obtain some documents. **********Going forward, the company would also inform Medicare of differences between reports of expenses it submits to the Government for reimbursement, and other cost reports it keeps for accounting reasons. The discrepancies between those two sets of reports are being used as crucial evidence of possible fraud in the criminal investigation. **********The plan also calls for Columbia to grant broad powers to outside lawyers and accountants who would be charged with investigating its current practices, recommending additional new policies and working to resolve the Government inquiries. **********Columbia officials declined to comment on the documents obtained by The Times or on any plans the company has prepared. ''I have not seen the documents you are referring to and cannot comment on them,'' said Victor L. Campbell, a Columbia senior vice president. **********Mr. Campbell also declined to comment on whether the company had adopted the strategies described in the documents. **********The plan comes just 12 days after the appointment of Dr. Thomas Frist Jr. as chairman and chief executive of the embattled company, replacing Richard L. Scott, Columbia's hard-charging founder. Health care experts who were told of certain details of the plan described them as symbolic of a new era for the company, which under Mr. Scott developed a reputation in just nine years as one of the most aggressive -- and profitable -- companies in the business. **********''The extent of these reforms, I think, is a measure of the seriousness of the problems that the company has gotten itself into,'' said Dr. Arnold Relman, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine. ''We are going to see a softer company that is not going to make as much money as it did before.'' **********Indeed, the changes are the most striking shift in strategy since Columbia was formed in 1987 by Mr. Scott, a lawyer who never managed a hospital, and Richard Rainwater, the Texas investor. Starting with less than $300,000, Columbia built itself from just two hospitals in El Paso to a corporate behemoth with $20 billion in revenues coming from roughly 350 hospitals, 550 home-health-care offices and scores of other medical businesses in 38 states. **********Columbia has been scrambling since last month, when teams of Federal agents began a seven-state raid of its hospitals and offices, seizing hundreds of boxes of documents in a multifaceted investigation that is focusing on whether Columbia hospitals overstated expenses to increase Federal reimbursement. **********In the weeks since, Mr. Scott and his top lieutenant have been forced out by the company's directors, and three Columbia executives responsible for reimbursement for certain Florida hospitals have been indicted on charges of conspiracy and fraud. **********Columbia's decision in the wake of those events to cooperate with the Government is a departure from its previous tactics. For example, according to people who are parties to the investigation, in secret court proceedings in the last year the company has fought Government requests for certain information relating to cost reports. Under the new plan those documents will be made available to investigators. **********The company also plans to be more open about its practices. For example, many Columbia hospitals maintained a secret, second set of cost reports that often differed dramatically from the reports submitted to Medicare. Those second reports estimated how much money a hospital might have to return to Medicare if it was audited. Some Columbia employees had been directed not to discuss the second reports with Medicare officials or to show them the documents. Under the new plan, Columbia hospitals will inform Medicare of differences between the two sets of reports. **********Many changes address problems at the company that were described in articles in The Times beginning in March. Those articles, the result of a yearlong investigation into Columbia's business practices, addressed the company's home care operations, bonus programs for executives who met financial targets, aggressive billing practices and investment opportunities for doctors. **********By deciding to sell the home-health-care business, Columbia is abandoning an area that has become a lightning rod for Federal investigators examining possible fraud in cost reports filed to receive Government reimbursement. Under Medicare rules, outpatient treatments like home care are reimbursed on a formula based on cost. Prosecutors are investigating whether Columbia improperly shifted hospital costs onto its home care agencies and misrepresented the costs of those agencies to increase its total reimbursement. **********A computer analysis by The New York Times conducted as part of its investigation found sharp differences between Columbia and its rivals in the amount Medicare paid for outpatient services like home care. Investigators are said to believe that at least some discrepancies may be the result of hospitals inflating their reported outpatient costs. **********For example, the Times analysis of Medicare data from Texas showed that care provided after hospitalization -- such as home care -- cost Medicare 23 percent more at Columbia hospitals than the state average, even after adjusting for severity of illness. As a result, the report found, the course of care at Columbia hospitals in Texas cost Medicare $48 million more than if the care had been billed at the state average. **********All told, according to Columbia's financial records, the home care business represented the largest component in the growth of its outpatient services, bringing in $1 billion in revenue last year, compared with $547 million in 1995. **********By eliminating cash incentive compensation, Columbia would be addressing what some critics have contended has been a flash point for abuse. Under its current compensation system, hospital administrators and other executives have been able to almost double their salaries through bonuses based almost entirely on meeting financial targets. But decisions about how to meet those targets have been left in the administrators' hands; doctors, nurses and some hospital executives contend that the incentives led to staff cuts that compromised care. **********Dr. Frist, Columbia's new chairman, was not available for comment last night, Mr. Campbell said. But associates said that he had long expressed discomfort with Columbia's policies of selling interests in its hospitals to doctors, concerned about possible conflicts of interest.

Analysts have warned that a buildup in inventories could lead to slower factory orders as companies attempt to empty their warehouses and stores of merchandise. **********In the months ahead, strength in manufacturing will come from auto makers, said Kevin Flanagan, an economist at Dean Witter Securities in New York.

Whitacre, a former executive at the Archer Daniels Midland Company, sued an F.B.I. agent on Monday. But he had only used the fabricated documents in recent weeks to buttress his claims about government wrongdoing to reporters. In a lengthy article concerning his allegations, Fortune magazine this week cited a document that Mr. Whitacre now says is not real. **********The developments will likely have little impact on the investigation that has brought Mr. Whitacre fame; rather, they may well highlight a once high-flying executive's struggle with mental illness. **********Mr. Whitacre has been at the nexus of the criminal investigation of price-fixing at Archer Daniels since 1992, when he agreed to use his position as a company executive to work undercover for the F.B.I. **********Since then, the case has experienced twists and turns that bordered on the bizarre. After his role as informant was disclosed, Mr. Whitacre admitted improperly obtaining money from Archer Daniels in overseas bank accounts; after negotiating a plea agreement with prosecutors, he switched gears and proclaimed his intent to fight the Government; after a year in which he publicly praised Brian Shepard, the F.B.I. agent who handled the case, Mr. Whitacre accused him in his lawsuit of ordering the destruction of tapes potentially beneficial to Archer Daniels. **********To back up those claims, Mr. Whitacre provided some news organizations, including The New York Times, with documents ostensibly showing that he had discussed F.B.I. wrongdoing with his psychiatrist and lawyer as early as July 1995. **********It is those documents that Mr. Whitacre admitted on Monday night were fabricated -- a legal act, since none of the records were submitted to a court or Government agency. He maintains that his underlying allegations are true. He added that tape recordings exist that could prove it, though he said they were not in his possession. **********Medical experts said at least some of Mr. Whitacre's behavior in recent years might be indicative of his mental illness. People with manic depression, also known as bipolar disorder, often gain a sense of invincibility that leads to self-destructive decisions. **********During the last few months, according to medical records verified by The Times, Mr. Whitacre's blood levels of lithium, the medication used to treat manic depression, have been too low to offer much -- if any -- medical benefit. **********While declining to comment specifically on any patient's case, Dr. Derek Miller, a Chicago-area psychiatrist who has treated Mr. Whitacre, said that uncontrolled bipolar patients experiencing mania can tell falsehoods while believing that they are speaking the truth. **********''A real crook or a real liar does it very well, but these people don't do it well at all,'' Dr. Miller said. ''They think they are being honest.'' **********Legal experts said that they expected that the latest twist in the Archer Daniels case would have little impact on the investigation. Three senior Archer Daniels executives, including Mr. Whitacre, have been indicted on price-fixing charges. Three executives with Asian companies pleaded guilty to price-fixing yesterday. **********By indicting Mr. Whitacre, ''the Government has already made the decision not to rely on him as a witness,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a  Columbia University law professor. ''Ninety percent of what he brought to the table were the tapes, and they still remain valid evidence.'' **********Among the documents Mr. Whitacre provided reporters was one purporting to be a letter to Mr. Whitacre from Dr. Miller, which appears to show Dr. Miller's concern in November 1995 about Mr. Whitacre's allegations against the F.B.I. **********There were numerous indications the document was not real: among them, the type and style did not match another letter by Dr. Miller, but were identical to other letters written by Mr. Whitacre, and the letterhead listed a telephone area code that did not exist when the letter was supposedly written. **********On Monday night at his office in Chapel Hill, N.C., at a meeting with a reporter from The Times attended by his wife, Mr. Whitacre first maintained that the document was real. But soon, with tears brimming in his eyes, he conceded it was fake. **********A second document purported to be a fax that he sent in July 1995 to his former lawyer, James Epstein, discussing F.B.I. wrongdoing. It was that document that was quoted in Fortune. Told Monday that Mr. Epstein was available by telephone to discuss the fax if Mr. Whitacre agreed to allow him, Mr. Whitacre conceded that it was also a fake. **********''It's not a fax that was sent at that time,'' he said, adding that he had created the document recently. **********After the meeting, Mr. Whitacre and his wife spoke with his psychiatrist, and he agreed to seek aggressive treatment. **********In a statement yesterday, John Huey, the managing editor of Fortune, said that the main points in its article -- that Mr. Whitacre planned to sue the F.B.I. and that he had a mental illness -- remained true. **********''Mark Whitacre, as we have warned our readers repeatedly, has a big credibility problem,'' he said.

Deals Setback To Ameritech Long Distance", "body_text": " **********In a major setback to expansion-minded local phone companies, the Justice Department recommended yesterday that the Ameritech Corporation be barred from offering long-distance service in Michigan. **********The department said Ameritech had failed to adequately open its existing local market to justify being allowed into a new one, though Joel I. Klein, the chief of the antitrust division, noted approvingly that ''local competition is beginning to take root in Michigan.'' **********The Federal Communications Commission will make the final decision by Aug. 19 on whether to allow Ameritech into the long-distance market in Michigan. While the Justice Department's recommendation is not binding, most experts said the F.C.C. would be likely to go along with it. **********''The process for the Bells getting into long distance is going to be one of knocking on the door until they break it down,'' said William Deatherage, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. ''It will take multiple applications for a company to have a reasonable chance.'' **********Ameritech, which offers local phone service in five Midwestern states, had already withdrawn and resubmitted its application, after the F.C.C. told the company it was likely to be rebuffed. **********The Justice Department has also recommended against allowing another Bell company, SBC Communications, which was formerly called Southwestern Bell, into the long-distance market in Oklahoma. And F.C.C. officials said yesterday that the commission was likely to formally reject that company in a few days. **********But the recommendation against Ameritech carries more weight because it is perceived as more open to competition than SBC. In Oklahoma, barely a handful of customers are getting local phone service from a company other than SBC. In Michigan, the largest competitor, Brooks Fiber Properties, serves more than 5,000 local customers in Grand Rapids. **********Still, regulators in Michigan said Ameritech controlled 86 percent of the residential and business lines in the state. And the Justice Department said the company had not yet created systems that would allow a new competitor to connect its customers into Ameritech's network. **********A spokesman for Ameritech said the company would not comment on the decision until it had reviewed the complete decision. **********The Justice Department's recommendation comes at a time of intensifying debate in Washington over the dearth of competition in the telecommunications industry. With the AT&T Corporation and SBC reportedly weighing a $50 billion merger, some lawmakers and regulators are fearful that the industry is rapidly consolidating into a handful of giants. **********Last Thursday, the chairman of the F.C.C., Reed E. Hundt, assailed a potential AT&T-SBC merger -- saying in a speech that it would be ''unthinkable'' under antitrust laws. And yesterday, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska introduced a bill in Congress intended to tighten the Government's scrutiny of mammoth mergers in telecommunications. **********In a speech in the Senate, Mr. Kerrey said, ''the urge to compete should not be replaced by the urge to merge.'' **********Despite the mounting criticism, AT&T and SBC are still laboring to reach an agreement, according to executives involved in the talks. Indeed, AT&T has begun waging an aggressive lobbying campaign in Washington -- even though the company has not confirmed the talks. **********In meetings with F.C.C. officials, lawyers for AT&T have suggested ways to structure a Bell merger that they contend would promote, rather than impede, competition. One proposal would be to split SBC into separate wholesale and retail operations. The wholesale company would then sell access to SBC and other competitors on equal terms. **********AT&T has also retained high-powered lobbyists like Robert S. Strauss, a former Democratic Party chairman who is a partner at the Washington law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. **********So far, though, the campaign seems to be falling on deaf ears. Officials at the F.C.C. said Mr. Hundt would not change his opposition to an AT&T-Bell deal if SBC were to spin off its local network. **********One senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, pointed out that AT&T itself had vociferously opposed such an arrangement when the Southern New England Telecommunications Company recently proposed it as part of an application to be deregulated in its home state of Connecticut. **********The debate over AT&T and SBC has become so all-consuming in Washington that executives at other telephone companies said they were worried that it could paralyze the regulatory process. **********Bell Atlantic and Nynex, for example, had hoped to close their $22 billion merger in mid-May, shortly after receiving approval from the Justice Department. But the F.C.C. has yet to sign off on it, and frustrated executives at the companies said yesterday that they probably would not be able to close the deal until the end of July. **********''I do think the AT&T-SBC hysteria has brought out the worst, not only in the F.C.C., but in people on the Hill,'' said one high-level executive at Bell Atlantic, who declined to be identified. **********Another executive at Bell Atlantic estimated the companies were forgoing $5 million in revenue for each day they could not combine their operations. That sum represents both the cost savings and potential synergies the companies could realize by merging. **********Officials at the commission denied that the decision on the Bell Atlantic-Nynex merger had been held up by the AT&T and SBC debate. But they acknowledged that one other piece of business might have been delayed: the F.C.C.'s decision on allowing SBC into the long-distance market, which was ready to be released last Thursday. **********The commission decided to hold off on releasing it, according to one official, because that day Mr. Hundt was speaking out against a potential merger of AT&T and a Bell. This official said the F.C.C. did not want to mix a formal commission ruling on SBC with a speech by Mr. Hundt about a hypothetical merger involving the same company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/03/business/international-briefs-sony-profit-increases-but-problems-are-seen.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1998-04-03", "snippet": "Sony Corp president Nobuyuki Idei says Sony earned record profit on record sales for second year running in 12 months just ended, yet year ahead will be 'very severe'; profit was at least 210 billion yen ($1.6 billion), up at least 51 percent, on ...", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sony Profit Increases, But Problems Are Seen", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Sony Profit Increases, But Problems Are Seen", "body_text": " **********The Sony Corporation earned a record profit on record sales for a second year running in the 12 months just ended, yet the year ahead will be ''very severe,'' its president, Nobuyuki Idei, said. **********Sony, the world's second-largest maker of home electronic appliances behind the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, will meet its sales and profit targets for the year that ended on Tuesday, Mr. Idei said.

They are second-class citizens among the Jews, and Israelis among the Arabs. **********''I have both sides,'' she said, gazing out over the sea from her hillside apartment in Haifa.

Berger, said in remarks prepared for a speech at Stanford University, ''Saddam's continued misrule of Iraq is harmful to the Middle East as a whole.'' He laid out economic and political reasons why the region should welcome a new Iraqi Government. **********''The sooner the situation is Iraq is normalized,'' he said, ''the sooner the people of the Middle East can get on with the business of building a more stable region and the more likely we are to realize our goal of seeing the region integrated, with consent of its people, into the international system.'' **********His address was for an event to honor a former Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, on the publication of his new book, ''In the Stream of History.'' **********Mr. Berger acknowledged that the recent American preoccupation with the overthrow of President Hussein was linked to a realization that Washington's long-term policy of containment of Iraq was under serious challenge. **********''Through constant confrontation, our policy of containing Iraq has been successful,'' he said. ''But that does not mean that by itself it is sustainable over the long run.'' **********He also conceded that sanctions, imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, might not be viable indefinitely.

Even the toughest of all sanctions regimes in history becomes harder to sustain over time.'' **********Mr. Berger's speech followed one on Thursday by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright at Emory University. She said the American policy of containment of Iraq had changed to one of ''containment plus regime change.'' **********Ms. Albright also said the United States was working with Iraqi opposition groups.

''We will also stand ready to help a new government in Iraq that respects the rights of its people and meets its obligations to the world,'' he said.

Analysts value Conoco at $20 billion to $25 billion. **********The sale would help DuPont, based here, to speed up efforts to increase its life-sciences businesses.

Last May, it agreed to buy the 50 percent stake of DuPont Merck Pharmaceuticals it did not own for $2.6 billion. **********A Conoco sale could also help restore some credibility to DuPont management, which failed to detect a 16 percent decline in second-quarter earnings until after the quarter ended.

''The media and the entertainment industries have become so completely intertwined, even in terms of ownership, that this has become an important focus for us,'' Mr. Bart said. **********Both of the city's general-interest tabloids have bolstered their media business coverage over the last year with daily sections focused on the industry. Both papers have covered deals in the industry for years, but the new sections are their attempts to better package coverage for their readers. **********The New York Post has Media City, whose main reporter, Michael Shain, writes a twice-weekly column on the industry. At The Daily News, the section is called Media Business, where Phyllis Furman leads the coverage. **********The New York Times has devoted its Monday business section to media and information in the broadest sense -- telephones and newspapers, movies and microchips -- since May 1995. **********The Daily News began running Media Business about a year ago, said Debbie Krenek, the paper's executive editor, after recognizing the media's role in New York and the public's interest. ''The section covers everything from books to film and magazines -- the whole media world,'' Ms. Krenek said. ''It's a big industry in the city, and we focus on it as a business.'' **********The Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, has been famous for its gossip about New York's heavy hitters. It got into media coverage years ago with a weekly review, invariably disapproving, of the way The New York Times went about its business. The column was written by Hilton Kramer, a former Times art critic, and has since been discontinued as the paper broadened its coverage of all media, said Ken Chandler, The Post's editor. **********''I think people forget that New York is the capital for foreign correspondents who are covering America from here,'' Mr. Chandler said. ''Their agenda is very much driven by what they see in the papers and on TV in this city.'' **********All this media self-absorption in New York City draws a dissent from John Polich, a newspaper consultant and professor of media business management at Fordham University. **********''Rupert Murdoch was one of the first to viscerally grasp that the geo-synchronous satellite was going to take the media industry global, and that media as an institution were no longer going to be grounded anywhere anymore,'' Mr. Polich said. **********After all, the television networks' corporate headquarters may be in New York City, and their evening news broadcasts may originate from Manhattan, but the rest of television has fallen into the hands of independent producers and distributors across the country, Mr. Polich said. **********''I think the era when Dave Garroway or Walter Cronkite sat in New York and you just knew that New York was the center of the news business in the United States is long gone,'' Mr. Polich continued. ''The networks don't have the dominant place in the country's life anymore, while CNBC and MSNBC are doing some of the best work in TV news from New Jersey, while CNN is in Atlanta.'' **********Mr. Bart, the editor of Variety, who sits in Los Angeles most of the time, says that New Yorkers get a little self-involved. **********''There is a degree of narcissism about the way we cover each other,'' he said, ''because we do like to read about ourselves, even if we are being a little self-referential.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/business/media-business-advertising-seeking-growth-weiss-whitten-stagliano-changes-its.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1998-10-16", "snippet": "Ad agency Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano is being renamed Weiss Whitten Stagliano Partners as nine creative, account, production and administrative executives are given stock in agency; new partners are gaining undisclosed minority interest in agency f...", "word_count": 694, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seeking growth, Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano changes its name and adds nine partners.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Seeking growth, Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano changes its name and adds nine partners.", "body_text": " **********A CREATIVELY focused New York agency is reorganizing as the principals seek to spark new growth. **********The agency, Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano, which creates campaigns for clients like Allied Domecq, The Economist, Ferrari and Guinness, is being renamed Weiss Stagliano Partners as nine creative, account, production and administrative executives are given stock in the downtown shop. The new partners are gaining the undisclosed minority interest in the agency from Marty Weiss and Adam Stagliano, who will hold the majority of the equity and voting shares. **********Weiss Stagliano was formed seven years ago as Weiss, Whitten, Carroll, Stagliano with the merger of two small shops that opened in 1989. Of the four principals who joined forces in 1991, the two who remain are Mr. Weiss, creative director, and Mr. Stagliano, president and account planning director. **********As for the other two, Tom Carroll, who left in 1993, is a partner at Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG, a unit of Havas Advertising in New York. And Nat Whitten, who left in November, started his own agency, Nat Whitten Inc. in New York. **********Weiss Stagliano is part of a new generation of agencies that were founded in the late 1980's and early 1990's by entrepreneurial talents who broke away from such hot shops as Chiat/Day; Fallon McElligott; Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, and Wieden & Kennedy. Though many of the newcomers are thriving, there is a widespread perception, as Warren Berger wrote in an article in the July-August issue of the trade publication Creativity, that they ''have not evolved all that far'' and ''have yet to hit the kind of early home run that promises future greatness.'' **********Progress for Weiss Stagliano, which estimates its billings at $85 million to $90 million, has been impeded by two recent setbacks. The Barnes & Noble Inc. retail and on-line accounts, with billings estimated at more than $40 million, left after less than a year for the New York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group. **********And the estimated $35 million Guerlain fragrance account, once shared by Weiss Stagliano with WSP/Australie, part of the Euro RSCG unit of Havas in Paris, was consolidated at the French agency by the French perfumer, which is owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Weiss Stagliano does, however, continue to maintain ties with WSP/Australie. **********''Do I think we had an aspiration 10 years ago to be bigger?'' Mr. Stagliano, 43, said in an interview. ''Absolutely.'' **********''I don't think we're quite as brash as we were,'' he added. ''But we still believe in our vision.'' **********Mr. Weiss, 44, who joined Mr. Stagliano for the interview, agreed. **********''We didn't lose a lot of sleep over what seemed like 'hits' to the outside world,'' Mr. Weiss said, because ''we've never felt more solid.'' **********''We have more focus and we have more management,'' he added. ''It's all coming together.'' **********One reason Mr. Stagliano gave for describing himself as a ''psychopathic optimist'' is that, he said, the agency ''has never been as busy new-business-wise.'' He listed a new $5 million account from American Skandia, a unit of the Skandia Insurance Company Ltd., and additional assignments from such clients as Allied Domecq Spirits and the Guinness Import Company. **********Weiss Stagliano is also taking part in account reviews, Mr. Stagliano said, that include the Chupa Chups lollipops sold by Chupa Chups USA and the Concord watch brand sold by Movado Group. **********''We've weathered partners leaving,'' he added, ''and the leaving of some fairly highly visible clients. We are not the new kids on the block; we have a certain maturity.'' **********The naming of the new partners is meant to encourage their efforts in the Weiss Stagliano advertising operation as well as at units that specialize in film and music, Internet marketing and brand design. **********''We wanted to come up with an incentive scheme,'' Mr. Stagliano said, ''and at agencies that can mean only one thing: giving out equity.'' **********The new partners are: Paul Budd, 35, studio director; Jeff Compton, 33, creative supervisor; Neil Cotton, 32, group account director; Louise Fischer, 31, group account director; Todd Gallentine, 34, creative supervisor; Jeff Greenberg, 41, production services director; Gay Holmes, 32, group account planning director; William Livolsi Jr., 39, chief financial officer, and Mark Mendelis, 30, creative supervisor."}}
