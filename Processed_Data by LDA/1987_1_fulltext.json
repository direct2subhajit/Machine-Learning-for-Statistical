The Soviet response today, which Mr. Gerasimov called a preliminary reaction, underscored the wide differences that remain over reductions in long-range weapons and the development of space-based offensive and defensive systems. Outlook on Medium-Range Arms **********The Geneva negotiations on long-range missiles and bombers are separate from the more promising talks on reducing medium-range missiles in Europe that both sides have said could produce a treaty by year's end. **********American officials said last week that the draft treaty on long-range missiles was unlikely to win Soviet acceptance, but that it was being presented to show Washington's willingness to press ahead with negotiations on strategic weapons despite the obstacles. **********Mr. Gerasimov said a Soviet draft document on reductions in strategic weapons more closely reflected understandings reached by President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, during their meeting in Iceland last October. **********He said the proposed American treaty departed from several points of agreement in Iceland, including the understanding that an initial 50 percent cut in strategic weapons would be made in five years. Seven-Year Period Cited **********Mr. Gerasimov said the latest American proposal called for reducing strategic offensive arms by half over seven years. **********In addition, Mr. Gerasimov said the American document, by setting subsidiary limits on specific classes of weapons, would force the Soviet Union to restructure its nuclear forces, a step that he said would be detrimental to Soviet security. **********The third objection raised by Moscow was Washington's failure to include a cut in long-range sea-launched cruise missiles in the draft treaty. **********Mr. Gerasimov said the fourth objection was to the absence in the document of provisions for further talks about the eventual elimination of all strategic offensive weapons. **********The fifth Soviet objection was the lack of any link between cuts in strategic weapons and curbs on the development of space weapons.  ---- NATO BACKING SOUGHT **********OSLO, Norway, May 12 (Special to The New York Times) - Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger plans to use a meeting of NATO defense ministers to seek Western support for proposal to eliminate all medium-range missiles, senior Defense Department officials said today. **********The United States and the Soviet Union agreed in Iceland on a formula that would eliminate medium-range missiles from Europe, while allowing each side to keep 100 warheads outside Europe. The Soviet Union would keep its weapons in its Asian territory, while the American warheads would be kept in the United States. **********Mr. Weinberger said today that this approach was inadequate. Although the Reagan Administration has said that it would prefer the elimination of all medium-range missiles, it has also stated it would settle for what was agreed on in Iceland. **********But Mr. Weinberger pressed his point with special vigor. ''We want global zero,'' he told reporters today en route to Norway. ''Nobody gains anything from 100 in Asia. There is no logical basis for supporting it.'' **********An aide to Mr. Weinberger said the Defense Secretary would stress this point at a two-day meeting of NATO's nuclear planning group, which begins Thursday in Stavanger, Norway."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/30/world/excerpts-from-speech-by-seoul-party-chief.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM SPEECH BY SEOUL PARTY CHIEF", "print_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM SPEECH BY SEOUL PARTY CHIEF", "body_text": " **********Following, in official translation, are excerpts from a nationally broadcast address today by Roh Tae Woo, chairman of the governing Democratic Justice Party, proposing sweeping constitutional changes: **********I have now come to a firm conviction about the future of our nation. I have anguished long and hard over the genuine mission of politicians at this historic time when deep-seated conflicts and antagonisms so accumulated among our citizens that they have erupted into a national crisis. **********Today, I stand before history and the nation with an extraordinary determination to help build a great homeland in which there is love and harmony among all segments and strata of the population, in which all are proud of being citizens and in which the Government can acquire wisdom, courage and genuine strength from the people. **********I will hereby forthrightly present my ideas. I intend to recommend them to President Chun Doo Hwan and am resolved to translate them into concrete action with the enthusiastic support of my party colleagues and the general public. **********First, the Constitution should be expeditiously amended, through agreement between the Government party and the opposition, to adopt a direct presidential election system, and presidential elections should be held under a new constitution to realize a peaceful change of government in February 1988. **********This does not mean a change in my belief that a parliamentary cabinet system . . . is the form of government best suited to enabling democracy to take hold in our country. However, if the majority of the people do not want it, even the best-conceived system will alienate the public, and the government that is born under it will not be able to dream and suffer together with the people. **********Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that a presidential election system must be adopted at this juncture in order to overcome social confusion and achieve national reconciliation. People are the masters of the country, and the people's will must come before everything else. Revising Election Law **********Second, in addition to switching to a direct presidential election system through constitutional revision, I think that to carry out elections democratically, it is necessary to also revise the Presidential Election Law so that freedom of candidacy and fair competition are guaranteed and so that the genuine verdict of the people can be given. **********Even under a direct election system, there should not be groundless character smearing and demagoguery to incite hostility, confusion, disorder and regional antagonisms, thereby undermining national stability and impeding genuine democratic development. There must be a solid framework to insure that elections are bona fide competitions in policies and ideas. **********Third, antagonisms and confrontations must be resolutely eradicated not only from our political community but also from all other sectors to achieve grand national reconciliation and unity. In this connection, I believe that Mr. Kim Dae Jung also should be amnestied and his civil rights restored, no matter what he has done in the past. **********At the same time, all those who are being detained in connection with the political situation should also be set free, except for those who have committed treason by repudiating the basic free and democratic order on which our survival and posterity hinges, and a small number of people who have shaken the national foundation by committing homicide, bodily injury, arson and vandalism. **********Fourth, human dignity must be respected even more greatly, and the basic rights of citizens should be promoted and protected to the maximum. I hope that the forthcoming constitutional amendments will include all the strengthened basic rights clauses being proposed by the Democratic Justice Party, including a drastic extension of habeas corpus. **********Fifth, to promote the freedom of the press, the relevant systems and practices must be drastically improved. . . . Newspapers should again be permitted to station their correspondents in provinces, the press card system should be abolished and newspapers should be allowed to increase the number of their pages as they see fit. **********Sixth, freedom and self-regulation must be guaranteed to the maximum in all other sectors also. . . . Local councils should be elected and organized without any hitch. . . . **********Colleges and universities - the institutions of higher learning - must be made self-governing, and educational autonomy in general must be expeditiously put into practice.  The Political Climate **********Seventh, a political climate conducive to dialogue and compromise must be created expeditiously, with healthy activities of political parties guaranteed. A political party should be a democratic organization that presents responsible demands and policies to mold and crystalize the political opinion of the people. The state should exert utmost efforts to protect and nurture political parties, so long as they engage in sound activities and do not contravene such objectives. **********Eighth, bold social reforms must be carried out to build a clean and honest society. In order that all citizens can lead a secure and happy life, crime against life and property, such as hooliganism, robbery and theft, must be stamped out, and deep-seated corruption and improprieties that still linger in our society must be eradicated. **********My fellow countrymen, on the strength of your expectations that there will be continued development rather than disruptions, I dare to make this proposal today in humble veneration of history and the people. These ideas stem from my genuine patriotism, and I am confident that they will blossom with support from all the people, and not only President Chun and members of the Democratic Justice Party. **********When these basic ideas have been accepted, additional details can be worked out. If they fail to be accepted, however, I want to make it very clear that I will resign from all public duties, including the presidential candidacy and the chairmanship of the Democratic Justice Party. **********Under no circumstances must we neglect to safeguard and promote the liberal democratic system. The task of peacefully changing administrations is the immediate task at hand. **********Furthermore, now that the Olympics are approaching, all of us are responsible for avoiding the national disgrace of dividing ourselves and thus causing the world to ridicule us. **********With the sacred right to vote at hand, let us all work together to create a society where young people develop their capabilities to realize their ideas, where workers and farmers can work free of anxiety, where businessmen exert even greater creative efforts and where politicians exercise the art of debate and compromise to work out the nation's future. I pledge my utmost efforts to create a dynamic, developing and genuinely democratic society where law and order prevail."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/25/business/company-news-court-is-picked-for-ltv-case.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Court Is Picked For LTV Case", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Court Is Picked For LTV Case", "body_text": " **********Federal District Judge Robert Sweet has ruled that a dispute over who has financial responsibility for the LTV Corporation's pensions would be litigated in Federal district court rather than bankruptcy court. **********The Dallas-based LTV filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 1986.

There was much talk about the causes and effects of the October crash. One senator said, ''Look, if I asked you to tell me what to do if you were in my shoes, what three steps would you take to solve the problem?'' Other than reiterating impatience with the budget deficit, all the Wall Street leaders were silent. **********Everyone is pointing a finger at everyone else. Wall Street tells the Government that it alone can solve the problem by closing the deficit. The Government tells Wall Street, ''We can try to do that, but you also have to try to get your act together; you've got to be more prudent on new products and regulate your own affairs.'' Each thinks it knows what the other should do. The truth is no one knows how to prevent another crash. **********We know that the net wealth of the nation cannot be reduced by something like half a trillion dollars without having some impact on the economy. The financial community was probably due for a cyclical downturn in any case, given the excesses of the past few years. But now everyone is watching to see what the impact will be on consumers. This could be critical; it is consumer spending rather than capital spending or profits that has kept the economy going over the past few years As I look back at those critical two weeks just after the crash, certain things stand out in my mind. I knew I was in uncharted waters, and much of what I had learned in previous crises was no longer relevant. We were dealing with something no one had seen before, except for those who lived through the 1929 crash. We became painfully aware that there was no coordinated mechanism in place for the markets to deal with each other. We all talked to one another about what was going on and we tried to coordinate activities, but there were no formal means by which the major decision-makers could work together. Nobody had ever imagined that something like this could happen and there was no emergency plan to handle it. **********I spent a good deal of my time on the trading floor, because I knew that the fate of the institution would depend on how our specialists and traders performed. I also knew that there were decisions I could make on the spot to help the specialists - a change in the system, a mid-stream adjustment, an emergency exemption from a rule. I wanted them to know, without a doubt, that the full power and influence of the institution was behind them. **********There was no sense of despair as apparently was the case during the 1929 crash. Nobody was threatening to jump out of windows. I was worried about one specialist who I know had suffered two heart attacks, but he seemed well and in control of himself. There was a very strong sense of camaraderie, a sort of battle mentality. We felt that we had a mission to carry out, to let the world know that we would be able to maintain liquidity in the marketplace. People knew they were going to lose money, but what was important was to maintain confidence in the system. The overriding objective was to keep the market open, because if that failed, panic could well set in, and the entire institution as well as individual businesses could be undone. **********We have always taken our mission to provide public access to the securities markets very seriously. We don't close during snowstorms, blackouts, power failures. We have back-up computers and take all sorts of steps to provide the kind of redundancy that assures continuity. We didn't want to fail now in the face of our greatest challenge. **********There are more war stories going around today about Terrible Tuesday - the day after the crash - than about Black Monday. People are wondering how close we came to international financial catastrophe. They want to know who talked to whom on the phone, what was said and what was done. But there is also talk about the system, whether it performed well and what corrections and adjustments need to be made. **********At the American Stock Exchange we were particularly fortunate that an enhancement to our new stock display system went into operation on Oct. 19. It was pure coincidence, but we had installed it on the previous Friday, tested it over the weekend, and turned it on Monday morning. Our previous system did not have the capacity to provide all the necessary financial information to our floor professionals, and they were always facing the possibility of losing out to traders upstairs or around the world who had more timely information. Our new system prevented that, and if we had not had it ready on that Monday, or if it had developed glitches the first day it was on, we would have been in deeper trouble than we were. With this new enhancement, the trading floor system actually worked better on Oct. 19, when there was four or five times the normal volume, than it had ever done before. **********It was a strange feeling to know that the maelstrom you were living through was the leading news story of the day. Although I felt it was important to maintain our tradition of being accessible to the press, there was the danger of being too visible at a time when difficult decisions were being considered. If news leaked out that we were contemplating closing the markets, which we were, it could have been catastrophic. Also, I could not reassure the public that things were going to be all right and that the market had bottomed out. **********I had expected to be badgered by friends and family for advice on what to do with their investments, but there was practically none of that. Instead they were worried about me, how I was holding up under the pressure. I stayed in Manhattan almost every evening, and I had acquiesced to carrying a beeper with an 80-mile radius to keep me in touch continuously with what was happening. **********IT was the worst period of tension I can remember, and I guess this was apparent to everyone I knew, including my 8-year-old daughter. One of her regular third-grade assignments is to write a news story every week about something going on in the world. Knowing that her father was at the center of the story of the week, she had asked me what the ''crash'' was all about. I explained that something which sold for $9 yesterday was now selling for $6. She wanted to know why that was bad. I pointed out that if she had bought it for $9 with the idea of selling it for $12 or $13 she would be upset if all she could get was $6. I wasn't sure she understood until I saw her news story at the end of the week, with the headline ''The Market Goes Crash'' and her explanation of why that was bad. I was amused to see that she ended her story with the sentence, ''So that's why dad was in such a bad mood.'' She included a drawing of me baring my teeth and saying, ''I'm mad. Grrr.'' **********That was the only news story that week that gave me a lift."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/30/business/candidate-list-for-commerce.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Candidate List for Commerce", "print_headline": "Candidate List for Commerce", "body_text": " **********Howard H.

Some say it is a case of marketing rather than finance. **********''Companies split their stock to broaden its distribution and make it more appealing to retail investors,'' said Richard Schmidt, director of research at Advest Inc. in Hartford. ''I would not, however, advise a strategy of merely buying stocks that have split or where a split appears imminent. It's a great flag, or starting point, but it should be only one of several criteria to be considered.'' The investor's temperament and financial objectives, Mr. Schmidt added, should also be taken into account. **********In the last few weeks the likes of General Electric, 3M, Great Northern Nekoosa, Chrysler and, more recently, International Paper have decided to split their shares. **********Analysts note that several of these stocks are components of the Dow Jones industrial average, the measurement of market movement based on 30 issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange. After a split the new, lower-priced stock continues to be divided by the same denominator to arrive at the index number, resulting in a more volatile Dow. **********According to Standard & Poor's, a record number of Big Board companies could declare stock splits this year. The record is 225, set in 1983, S.&.P. said. Last year 209 companies declared splits of 3 for 2 or more. **********''When management splits its stock, it signals confidence in the company,'' said Phil Goldsmith of Goldsmith & Harris, an investment research and advisory firm. ''This usually follows several quarters of good earnings growth with the prospects of a couple more good years ahead. We continue to like Borden, which split 2 for 1 in 1985 and 3 for 2 in 1986.'' **********Other stocks he favors include Ethyl Corporation, which split 2 for 1 in 1983, 2 for 1 in 1985 and 2 for 1 in 1986; American Cyanamid, which just announced a split, and Loctite, which he believes might consider a split in the foreseeable future. **********Mr. Goldsmith said Green Tree Acceptance, the nation's largest originator and servicer of manufactured-housing mortgages, is another of his favorites. ''The stock has done exceptionally well since it split 2 for 1 in June of 1986, rising from a post-split price in the mid-teens to its closing yesterday on the Big Board of $34.375,'' he said. **********The concept of the stock split is simple, but its implications and advantages for the investor are more subtle. **********In a 2-for-1 split, the holder of one share of stock is like the owner of one pint of ice cream who suddenly finds he has two half-pints instead. At first the two new units have the same total value as one of the older units. **********Market history proves, however, that several positives usually go hand-in-hand with a split, including enhanced investor confidence, an increase in the cash dividend and possibly improved profits. **********The split also makes shares more manageable and attractive to small investors if they like to buy in round lots of 100 shares. Also, if the market turns down, individual shares do not show as much of a dollar loss, often a psychological advantage. **********By attracting small investors with a lower-priced stock and thus getting more of the shares into the hands of individuals, a company provides itself with greater insurance against the possibility of unwanted takeover attempts. **********Mr. Goldsmith said the lure of lower-priced equities for investors was borne out by New York Stock Exchange statistics showing that over the last 10 years 91.6 percent of all stocks on the Big Board traded below $60 a share, 85 percent below $50, 74.4 percent below $40 and 56.3 percent below $30. Last year 84 percent traded below $60 a share. **********''Investors should keep in mind, however, that a lot of smaller institutions are not immune to the attraction of a lower-priced stock,'' said Mr. Schmidt of Advest. **********According to Mark Grinblatt, assistant professor of finance at the University of California at Los Angeles Graduate School of Management, stock splits are indeed good news for investors. **********A study he helped write, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in December 1984, said a typical stock split on the New York Stock Exchange was associated with a 2.6 percent increase in the stock's price on the day of the announcement and the day after. **********''The number of firms that had positive stock increases was 73.5 percent,'' he said. ''One of the reasons was that a large number of stocks in our sample - 850 stock splits over a period of 10 years -also reported positive earnings and cash dividends on the day of the stock split announcement. **********''Other than superior price performance around the ex date of the split, there is no evidence that stocks experience long-run abnormal performance subsequent to the announcement.'' **********What does a split mean mean for the stock itself? The 3-for-2 split announced by Chrysler last Thursday illustrates the fact that instant, though sometimes not substantial, rewards can occur.

The agency's figures for total OPEC output were comparable with those reported recently by the Middle East Economic Survey, a Cyprus-based journal. **********In response to the I.E.A. report, several industry analysts predicted that OPEC production would decline over the next few months. But they were divided on whether a drop in production would result in a firming of prices, since many believe there will be a concurrent drop in purchases due to a reduction in stockpiling. **********''Right now OPEC is overproducing, but it's not so bad because there is stock-building due to the tensions in the Middle East, but the stockpiling cannot go on forever,'' said John Calverly, a senior economist with the American Express Bank in London. Prices Are Vulnerable **********Many oil analysts say the crisis in the Gulf has placed some upward pressure on oil prices, but Mr. Calverly contends that prices are vulnerable because of the combination of oversupply and a probable slowdown in stockpiling. **********On Thursday, two important OPEC committees, on price stability and on quota adherence, will meet in Vienna. They are expected to urge members to reduce production to help strengthen prices, which have dropped since early last month. But because of tensions among Gulf states, the committees are expected to have a hard time convincing members to band together to restrain output. **********''We don't expect much from the meetings,'' said one European-based oil analyst. ''The worst overproducers, Iran and Iraq, won't be there and the committees will have a hard time getting them to cut production because of the war.'' **********According to the I.E.A., Iraq, which has been at war with Iran for more than six years, produced 2.2 million barrels a day in July, compared with the quota of 1.5 million barrels, while Iran, produced 2.8 million barrels compared with its quota of 2.4 million. **********In the past the Saudis have reduced output to help stabilize prices. However, some analysts said the Saudis' recent overproduction indicated that they were not so eager to strengthen prices because that would help Iran, a leading OPEC price hawk. Spot Prices Decline **********A major reason for the jump in production from July to August, industry analysts said, was that oil companies were eager to buy from OPEC nations because their official $18-a-barrel price was lower than the spot price, which had been driven above $21 a barrel as a result of tensions in the Persian Gulf. **********But the overproduction got so out of hand that spot prices, according to the International Energy Agency, have fallen about $2 a barrel since late July. **********''As the spot market for Mideast oil stays below official OPEC prices and assuming that OPEC producers hang tough on their official price, the oil companies will cut back on their purchases from OPEC and will buy on the spot market to meet demand,'' said William L. Randol, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation. He said this would encourage OPEC to rein in production and put some stability into oil prices. **********Mr. Randol predicted that OPEC output would decline by as much as 1.5 million barrels a day over the next few months, helping to stabilize spot prices in the $18- to $20-a-barrel range. He also anticipates that OPEC would seek to push up its official price by $1 or $2 a barrel at the December meeting of the 13 member nations. **********One of the biggest questions in OPEC is how the cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Iran that has helped lead OPEC in recent months will be affected by the recent rift between the two nations resulting from the deaths of Iranian pilgrims in Mecca."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/05/world/the-reagan-white-house-iran-money-trail-is-focus-of-house-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1987-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 779, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRAN 'MONEY TRAIL' IS FOCUS OF HOUSE INQUIRY", "print_headline": "THE REAGAN WHITE HOUSE; IRAN 'MONEY TRAIL' IS FOCUS OF HOUSE INQUIRY", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the special House committee investigating the Iran-contra affair said today that his panel's inquiry would focus on what happened to the proceeds from the sale of arms to Iran. **********''We still have a very incomplete understanding of the money trail at this point,'' the chairman, Representative Lee H.

Thus far, the Swiss Government has refused to allow the records to be released, and the Congressional committees have had no success obtaining them elsewhere. **********The Swiss bank accounts were apparently controlled by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the former White House assistant at the center of the controversy, and Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general who worked with Colonel North. Both have asserted their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and have refused to testify or produce records in the case. **********Mr. Hamilton said his investigators were taking other steps to obtain the records, but he would not say what they were. **********Last week, the special Senate committee voted to begin unusual legal proceedings against General Secord that, if successful, would compel him to authorize release of bank records in his control or face imprisonment for contempt of Congress.

Williams, chairman of the firm. **********Equitable, in the offering filed Thursday, said its Equitable Investment Corporation subsidiary would sell the stake in Alliance next year. **********''Equitable's motivation is to give the right incentive to retain professionals,'' Mr. Williams said. **********In addition to the public offering of 6.6 million units, the 70 employees will be offered a combined stake of 18 percent in Alliance. The firm said it had not yet set a price for that sale but, in documents filed with the S.E.C., estimated it at $9 to $11 a unit. **********The offering, in the form of a master limited partnership, will provide these investment professionals with a ''valid public market for our securities,'' Mr. Williams said. Units in the partnership will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange, so employees will be able to cash in their holdings. **********In an industry where professionals' compensation has been compared with that of rock stars, Alliance is known as one of the nation's highest-paying money management firms. Lucrative Compensation **********Its S.E.C. filing discloses extremely lucrative compensation packages. **********In 1986 the total employee compensation as a percentage of revenues was 47.1 percent. The cash compensation for the nine highest-paid executives totaled $8.4 million. Mr. Williams received $1.5 million; Alfred Harrison, executive vice president, $1.4 million; Philip VonBlon, vice chairman, $1.1 million; Frank W.

Other firms that have sold limited partnership units to the public are Oppenheimer Capital Management and Reich & Tang. **********Investment management firms use the master limited partnership structure because it lets them pass on their enormous cash flow without paying a corporate income tax. Individual Tax Rates Paid **********Instead, unit holders pay individual tax rates on their share of the profits. Investment management firms need very little capital and do not need to retain earnings. In a partnership they can pass their earnings through to the unit holders and create high-yielding investments for individuals. **********But Congress is trying to change the tax structure, which might make these less attractive investments. In October the House voted to change the tax treatment for such partnerships. The Senate has not yet acted on the bill, and its fate is uncertain. But some money managers believe that new master limited partnerships may no longer enjoy the favorable tax structure. **********In the first nine months of this year Alliance's net income was $6.5 million on revenues of $96.2 million. Last year revenues were $103.4 million, up from $77.2 million in 1985 and $62.6 million in 1984.

Oil prices went as high as $22 a barrel and exploration for new oil in the United States began to accelerate, increasing the demand for the drilling rigs, casing, pipe and other equipment and services needed to find and produce new reserves. **********Further helped by a surge in foreign orders, many members of the industry - including Schlumberger Ltd., the Halliburton Company and Dresser Industries - returned to the black. And many executives were confidently predicting that a $10 billion reduction in operating costs since 1985 would enable the industry as a whole to turn a profit in 1988. A Sudden Reversal **********Now these executives are not so certain. The hopes that better days were at hand dwindled a couple of weeks ago, when oil prices suddenly slumped after OPEC could not persuade all its members to go along with a plan to limit their production. **********For instance, the price of the American benchmark crude oil, West Texas Intermediate, dropped by more than $4, to below $15 a barrel. And although it now sells for just under $17, that is still below the $19 of four weeks ago. **********Even if oil prices average only $15 a barrel next year, the oilfield service industry stands to break even, many in the industry say. That is partly because of belt tightening, bankruptcies of some competitors and consolidations among others over the past two years. For example, Baker Hughes Inc., a company formed by the merger last April of Baker International Inc. and the Hughes Tool Company, says it has reduced its annual operating costs by $85 million by cutting its staff and achieving other economies of scale. **********With oil at $15 a barrel, the number of rigs used to drill for new oil in the United States - a key barometer of the industry's health - would average about 950 in 1988, according to the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group. **********A comparison with 1987 figures reflects the industry's progress in lowering costs and narrowing losses. This year, when the drilling-rig average was 936, or only 14 below the projected break-even average for next year, the 95 public companies in the industry lost 4 cents on every dollar of sales, according to estimates by Simmons & Company International, a Houston investment bank. (Collectively, these companies have lost $11.4 billion in the past three years, Simmons said.) Should oil prices rebound to $18 a barrel next year, the number of rigs would probably average 1,100 to 1,200. The total in operation last Monday was 1,145, still close to the year's peak of 1,181 two weeks ago and far above the low of 744 on May 10. While the $18-a-barrel figure would still be way below the peak of 4,500 in 1981, it would be high enough for most companies in the industry to make money. Lower Prices Seen **********But rather than expecting prices to return to $18 a barrel, some energy analysts and officials of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries say overproduction by the cartel's members makes it more likely that prices will sink to as low as $12 within a few months. ''We expect prices to soften in late January and February, to around $12 or $13, and stay there for some period,'' said Dennis Eklof, a director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting concern in Cambridge, Mass. **********If prices average $15 a barrel or less into the summer, another wave of consolidation, through mergers and joint ventures, will probably sweep the industry, analysts and executives predict. Many energy experts fear that the damage from such a contraction would outweigh the gains. **********Indeed, the industry already could not supply the exploration equipment and services that would be required to find enough new oil to keep the nation's dependence on oil imports from rising. Imports now supply about 40 percent of the oil consumed in the United States, and about 2,500 rigs, or more than twice the number in operation, would have to be drilling for new oil just to maintain the status quo, most experts agree. **********At the moment, however, the question of whether the industry could support such an exploration level is academic. Most experts agree that exploration will not increase significantly until oil sells for $25 a barrel for a sustained period. Signs of a Weaker Industry **********Still, the signs of the industry's weakened state are already evident. Richard L. Kinchelow, a senior vice president at Enserch Exploration Inc., a Dallas-based exploration and production company, said the performance of the oilfield service companies he hires ''is acceptable, but down.'' Many have not kept their equipment in good shape, he said. **********Moreover, many analysts and some executives fear that the quality of equipment and service will deteriorate further because the industry cannot attract the capital it needs to maintain existing equipment and to develop new products. **********The oilfield service industry will have to become solidly profitable before the situation is reversed, and that prospect ''looks like a fairy-tale land right now,'' said Matthew Simmons, president of the investment bank that bears his name. ''The industry can't sustain itself as it is.'' Supplies Could Tighten **********Analysts and executives say it would take the industry a minimum of six months and possibly more than a year to gear up to support a healthy rate of drilling - at least 2,000 rigs in operation. **********Many manufacturers of the heavy steel pipe used to drill wells mothballed their operations after 1982, and only three domestic steelmakers have maintained working plants: the USX Corporation; National Oilwell, a joint venture formed in April, and the CF& I Steel Corporation. Meanwhile, supplies of the pipe have sharply tightened in the past year - because of both rising demand and purchases by speculators - and prices of some widely used types of pipe have more than doubled. **********''If you saw a 25 percent increase in active rigs, drill pipe would become a weak link,'' said L.C. Martin, chairman and chief executive of the Aztec Manufacturing Company, a specialized producer of casings, tool joints and other products used by rig operators. **********Mr. Eklof of Cambridge Energy Research predicted that steelmakers that dropped out of the business would quickly reactivate their plants if prices continued to rise. Shortage of Workers Looms **********A looming shortage of skilled workers, especially machine-tool operators, may be harder to cure. ''We're working an awful lot of overtime because of this,'' Mr. Martin said. ''To a certain extent, it's limiting what we can produce.'' **********Many skilled machinists lost their jobs in oil equipment factories after the oil boom ended in the early 1980's. Thousands abandoned the Southwest and found new jobs in other regions. Executives said these workers would be hard to lure back because of worries about being laid off again. **********''Companies are having to talk to 12 or 15 former employees to get one to come back,'' Mr. Simmons said. **********Robert G. Fowler, president of Enserch Exploration, added: ''We would have a serious personnel problem if there was a sharp increase in the rig count, say to 2,000. Probably the bulk of the added people would be inexperienced, and that would put them so far back on the training curve it would cost us.'' **********Marvin Gearhart, chairman and chief executive of Gearhart Industries, thinks the manpower shortage would take more than a year to correct, especially in the production of highly technical equipment used by exploration companies. Gearhart a Case Study **********The transformation of Gearhart, a maker of technology used in wells to improve the analysis of geological formations, illustrates the woes of hundreds of oilfield service companies. Gearhart lost $567 million in 1985 and 1986, and slashed its work force to 500, from 2,000 in 1981. **********This year Gearhart missed deadlines on several debt payments, but fought off bankruptcy by selling assets and by sustaining sales in foreign markets, which accounted for $80 million of an estimated $150 million in revenues this year. Its biggest year was 1985, when revenues topped $640 million. **********Now, even if oil prices suddenly rise, ''we're going to be reluctant to jump back in and hire people,'' Mr. Gearhart said, adding: ''We've lost so much money. We've been burned so bad.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/23/world/north-korea-reported-to-watch-carefully.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "North Korea Reported To Watch Carefully", "print_headline": "North Korea Reported To Watch Carefully", "body_text": " **********The civil unrest here has not significantly affected North Korean military movements, Gen.

PLANS 4.8% RATE CUT", "print_headline": "A.T.& T. PLANS 4.8% RATE CUT", "body_text": " **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company yesterday provided the first details of an expected reduction in long-distance rates, saying that it would lower basic domestic rates by an average of 4.8 percent on July 1. **********The reduction would save consumers more than $590 million a year, or about 72 cents on a typical $15 monthly bill, A.T.&T. said. It would apply to residential and business long-distance service, but not to A.T.&T.'s 800-number toll-free service or to its WATS service. **********The new reduction would mean that A.T.&T.'s rates have fallen nearly 16 percent so far this year and roughly 34 percent since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984. MCI, U S Sprint to Respond **********A.T.&.T.'s principal competitors, the MCI Communications Corporation and the U S Sprint Communications Company, said they would soon announce their own rate cuts. But they said they wanted to study A.T.&.T.'s reductions before giving details. In the past, the rivals have cut rates to maintain a price advantage of 10 to 20 percent below A.T.&T. **********''We will continue to be priced lower than A.T.&T.,'' said Gary Tobin, an MCI spokesman. **********At U S Sprint, ''We will maintain price leadership,'' said Sid Crossen, a spokesman. **********A.T.&.T.'s action is a direct result of the Federal Communications Commission's decision earlier this year to increase the monthly charge that individuals and small businesses pay for access to the local telephone network, to $3.50, from $2. This access charge helps local telephone companies recover the fixed costs of their facilities and equipment. **********The higher access charge for customers means that the long-distance companies would have to pay less in fees to subsidize these fixed costs. The F.C.C. limits A.T.&T.'s rate of return on long-distance service, and the company is required to pass on these savings to customers. Since A.T.&T. has about 80 percent of the long-distance business, its rivals are under pressure to match any reduction. Only 60 Cents on July 1 **********The A.T.&T. rate reduction, which must still be approved by the F.C.C., actually reflects only a 60-cent increase in customer access charges on July 1. The remainder of the $1.50 increase would be put into effect later this year and next. Whether A.T.&T. customers actually end up with net savings from the rate cut depends on how many long-distance calls they make. **********Just how the price cuts would affect the long-distance companies' financial results remains to be seen. ''In theory it should be a wash,'' an A.T.&T. spokesman said, because the rate cuts are being matched by reductions in the fees A.T.&T. pays to the local telephone companies. Indeed, A.T.&T. could benefit if the lower rates encourage more long-distance calls. The same should hold true for MCI and U S Sprint. **********Still, these lower prices have resulted in reduced profits for MCI and U S Sprint. MCI has already said that while it expects to be profitable in 1987, it foresees disappointing second and third quarters. And U S Sprint, which has been losing money for more than two years, could see those losses widen as a result of the lower rates. **********Wall Street analysts said they had been expecting a cut of the size announced. ''It's about right,'' said Audrey Stevoff, a telephone analyst at Duff & Phelps. She predicted that MCI ''pretty much will follow.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/27/world/us-can-retaliate-for-mining-in-gulf-weinberger-warns.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1987-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1082, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. CAN RETALIATE FOR MINING IN GULF, WEINBERGER WARNS", "print_headline": "U.S. CAN RETALIATE FOR MINING IN GULF, WEINBERGER WARNS", "body_text": " **********Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said today that the United States would increase its ability to detect and destroy mines in the Persian Gulf, and was ''perfectly capable'' of retaliating against whatever force put mines in the way of merchant ships bound for Kuwait. **********Mr. Weinberger gave no indication that he knew who laid the mine that damaged the Kuwaiti tanker Bridgeton Friday. But he said the United States Navy would search more diligently for mines in the gulf. **********Salvage specialists said today that the Bridgeton was damaged more seriously than originally estimated, according to The Associated Press. Divers who inspected the listing tanker near Sea Island, Kuwait, reported that 4 of her 32 compartments were flooded, according to maritime salvage specialists in Dubai quoted by the A.P. Initial reports had said only one compartment was flooded. A Difficult Task **********The Pentagon has been told to give a higher priority to protecting convoys against mines than to retaliating for the Bridgeton episode. But since neither the Navy nor gulf countries friendly to the United States have many minesweeping craft, naval experts said it would be difficult to prevent a recurrence. **********''If we find the party that laid the mines, we are perfectly capable of taking retaliatory steps, certainly,'' Mr. Weinberger said on the ABC News program ''This Week.'' **********Appearing before Mr. Weinberger on the same program, the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations, Said Rajaie Khorassani, said that the mine blamed for damaging the Bridgeton ''might be ours, it might be somebody else's.'' 'We Are Pleased' **********But he added, ''We are pleased to see that the tanker was hit.'' **********Asked about the possibility of American retaliation, he said: ''I think if the United States wants to be further involved in the war, it can proceed. We have no objection to that. We have to prepare for the worst, of course.'' **********On Friday, the White House said that retaliation was not being considered, and that there was no evidence of who had placed the mine. But military officials said, even before the escort operation began, that they are prepared if necessary to retaliate if Iran acted against American installations or personnel. French Alert Warships **********In Paris today, a French Defense Ministry spokesman said the aircraft carrier Clemenceau and three support vessels had been put on alert and told they might have to sail for the Middle East within 24 hours. The spokesman said the alert should not imply future action but was ''justified by the international situation in the Middle East, particularly in Lebanon and in the gulf.'' **********In his remarks, Mr. Weinberger said the Navy would not necessarily need to send minesweeping ships to the gulf. The Navy has only a few active-duty minesweepers. **********More likely, officials said, helicopters would be used to search for mines. ''We have a minesweeping capability in the Persian Gulf, and it can be increased and will be increased,'' Mr. Weinberger said. ''What we don't do is talk about it, talk about where it's based and all the rest.'' **********However, naval experts said clearing mines with helicopters alone would be extremely difficult. It would require long hours of flying, in air that is hot, dense and often full of sand. Red Sea Minesweeping Recalled **********Since May 17, five ships have struck mines in the northern half of the gulf. In his efforts to describe the American ability to counter this relatively new threat in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Weinberger mentioned the finding and destruction of several mines in Kuwaiti territorial waters in recent weeks, and a long search for mines in the Red Sea in 1984, when several ships hit mines thought to have been placed by Libya. **********In 1984, mine searching teams from the Netherlands, Italy, France, Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, Egypt and Saudi Arabia looked for mines in the Red Sea. Few of the devices were found before merchant ships hit them. **********Mr. Weinberger's remarks seemed to suggest that the Navy would use similar tactics. This would mean using RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopters based either on land or on ships. **********One ship used as a helicopter base in the Red Sea, the La Salle, is the command ship for the group of frigates, destroyers and cruisers that is protecting merchantmen flying the American flag in the gulf. The extended escort is taking the warships farther north in the gulf than they used to go. **********In the Red Sea operation, helicopters also worked from a Marine amphibious transport ship, the Shreveport, and an oceanographic research ship also took part in the search. Four Marine amphibious ships, including the dock landing ship Spiegel Grove, the amphibious assault ship Guadalcanal, and two tank landing ships, the Saginaw and the La Moure County, recently moved from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean, not far from the Gulf. Saudis Helped Clear Mines **********The Pentagon has been reluctant to say exactly how it assisted Kuwait in clearing mines from waters near its main harbor. It is believed that United States Navy specialists brought special sonar equipment to Kuwait and found the mines, using small boats or aircraft. Kuwaiti frogmen, carrying handheld sonars that can detect basketball-sized objects from 100 yards away, then pinpointed the mines and destroyed them with explosives. **********Saudi Arabia sent two of its four minesweepers to Kuwait to find a clear channel for ships to use. It is not known whether Saudi Arabia has been asked, or would agree, to operate its minesweepers farther at sea, in dangerous waters near the Iranian island base of Farsi, in the area where the Bridgeton sustained damage. **********In his remarks, Mr. Weinberger cautioned that a full investigation is needed to prove that the Bridgeton explosion was caused by a mine. **********''It has not been firmly established that this was a mine,'' he said. ''It could have been an internal explosion. I don't think it was. I think it was a mine. But it hasn't been firmly established.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/08/world/voice-of-gorbachev-an-old-summit-hand.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 271, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Voice of Gorbachev: An Old Summit Hand", "print_headline": "Voice of Gorbachev: An Old Summit Hand", "body_text": " **********When Mikhail S.

Third Day of Unrest **********The announcements on national television came at the end of a third day of nationwide strikes with scattered eruptions of violence in the capital in which 4 people were killed and at least 13 others were wounded by gunfire from soldiers. Medical authorities said at least 11 people were killed in clashes with troops earlier in the week and that about 70 were wounded. **********It has been one of the bloodiest periods in Haiti since the chaotic weeks that preceded and followed the collapse of the dictatorship of Jean Claude Duvalier 17 months ago.

In a letter of resignation, Mr. Lorthe said he was stepping down to facilitate ''a solution to this national crisis.'' **********When the Government declared 11 days ago that it was taking control of elections from the electoral council, it touched off an uproar that brought virtually every political organization in the country together in opposition. **********The action was almost universally seen as a violation of the new Constitution that was overwhelming endorsed in late March and as an attempt by the military leaders to transform their provisional Government into a dictatorship. **********The great popularity of the Constitution, copies of which some voters had carried with them to the polls, stemmed from its array of carefully worded protections against the kinds of despotism that has dominated Haiti's history. **********Individuals of all social strata condemned the Government's apparent reversion to rule by force that was reminiscent of the nearly 30-year period in which Mr. Duvalier and his father, Francois, ruled and plundered Haiti. **********At barricades in the capital today, two civil servants displayed the depth of feeling the crisis has evoked, speaking bitterly of the Government's seizure of the electoral process and insisting that while they received Government paychecks, their first loyalty was ''to the people.'' Threat of U.S. Aid Cutoff **********In an interview tonight, Pierre Robert Auguste, Haiti's deputy Minister of Information, said the Government hoped the measures it took tonight, under threats from the United States that more than $100 million in foreign aid was in danger of being cut off, would return calm to Haiti. **********The Government's decision, Mr. Auguste said ''guarantees the viability of Haitian democracy, despite its frailty.'' **********But some of the political leaders who have been prominent in the anti-Government campaign on the election issue said they were disappointed that the Government had failed to reinstate a labor federation that it dissolved last week in another apparent contravention of the Haitian Constitution. Late in the night, the sounds of gunshots periodically broke the quiet of the capital's darkened streets. **********Mr. Auguste said that while there had been no specific reference to the banned union tonight, he said he believed the actions on the electoral issue ''opened the way'' to lifting the sanctions. 'Trade Union Freedoms' **********''Trade union freedoms remain guaranteed in the Constitution,'' he said. **********The anti-Government protests began initially with demands for the restoration of authority to the electoral council, but broadened into calls for the resignation of the military Government headed by Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy. The calls appeared to be gaining increasing public support. **********In demonstrations in half a dozen provincial towns today many protesters chanted slogans insisting that the Government step down and in the dilapidated coastal town of Jacmel, south of Port-au-Prince, marchers carried a coffin that they said symbolized the death of the military Government. **********In the capital, protesters set fire to two buses and two cars and blocked the main road to the south with the charred wrecks.

That acquisition led to a British Government investigation and the dismissal of a handful of Guinness top executives, including the chairman, Ernest Saunders. The Government is investigating suspicious stock dealings during the takeover bid, and Mr. Saunders has been indicted on three criminal charges. **********For years Schenley distributed Distillers' strongest brands in the United States, led by Dewar's White Label, the top-selling Scotch whiskey in that market, and Gordon's gin and vodka. **********In the run-up to the Distillers acquisition, Mr. Riklis was a heavy buyer of Guinness shares, which helped the Guinness bid prevail over a competing offer. Afterward the legal title to the Dewar's White Label brand and distribution rights were transferred to Mr. Riklis for a nominal sum, raising concerns among British investigators that this was in return for his support of the Guinness stock price. Incentive to Sell Is Noted **********In a statement today, Guinness said that last November's agreement for the assignment of the Dewar trademarks and distribution arrangements had been declared ''null and void.'' **********The Schenley acquisition, according to bankers and analysts, gives Mr. Riklis a fair price to get out of the business. Moreover, they add, Mr. Riklis has considerable incentive to sell because Schenley's $500 million-a-year sales depend largely on distributing brands controlled by Guinness, whose new management views Mr. Riklis as linked to the discredited Mr. Saunders. **********A few months ago Anthony Tennant, the new Guinness chief executive, served notice that Guinness wanted to buy Schenley. ''And since Guinness supplies the brands Schenley sells, Riklis really didn't have much choice,'' said a banker familiar with the deal. **********According to a Guinness spokesman, Mr. Riklis is still believed to hold about 30 million Guinness shares, roughly 3.5 percent of the company. Mr. Riklis could not be reached for comment. **********For Guinness, the Schenley acquisition is a big step in its strategy to control its key brands at every stage of the business, from production and promotion to marketing and sales. Control of Brands in U.S.  ''Guinness will capture the profit of the importer and regain control over the destiny of its brands in the United States,'' observed Marvin R. Shanken, editor of Impact International, a trade journal. **********Mr. Tennant, the 56-year-old chief executive, employed the same strategy when he was in charge of Grand Metropolitan's International Distillers and Vintners subsidiary. For example, analysts note, Grand Metropolitan acquired Liggett in 1980 because it distributed the British company's J & B Scotch whiskey. **********''Tennant is using the same formula at Guinness that he did at Grand Metropolitan and for the same reasons,'' said Daniel Leaf, an analyst for Wood Mackenzie & Company, a brokerage house. **********For his part, Mr. Tennant noted the necessity of managing the marketing of the company's brands. ''This major move will prove to be of considerable benefit to Guinness from the outset,'' he said. **********In the fiscal year ending next Jan. 31, Schenley is expected to have pretax earnings of roughly $65 million on sales of $500 million. **********Besides distributing Guinness products, Schenley markets other brands, including I.

Paulson, who had been chairman of the company until early January. **********In January Mr. Lubensky bought a 34.2 percent stake in the company for a mere $100,000 from Mr. Paulson. The market price of the Paulson stake was valued by analysts at $13.5 million. It was thought at the time that Mr. Paulson had sold his stake for such a low sum as part of a plan to install Mr. Lubensky as chairman of the company. **********Apparently developments did not go according to plan and George A. Ferris, who had been vice chairman and chief executive was installed as chairman instead. Then yesterday Mr. Ferris stepped down. **********When the Paulson stake changed hands, Mr. Paulson, who had paid $50 million for the 1.7 million shares that he bought in 1983 and 1984, said that he had sold them at such a dramatic discount to public market prices to offset gains from other investments. **********Mr. Paulson is chairman of the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation. Mr. Lubensky bought American Jet from Mr. Paulson in 1982. It has since been sold to Ryder Systems, but Mr. Lubensky remains president.

The Senate had approved the provision tentatively Wednesday after its Democratic sponsors significantly eased it to attract support. **********With the vote, six leading business organizations said they would withdraw their support for the entire thousand-page bill. These organizations - including the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers - have been part of the crucial core support for trade legislation and were willing to back Congress on other provisions the Administration opposes. **********The President's trade representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, said, ''There's no chance whatsoever of the President signing a bill that includes the language of the Senate bill as it now exists.'' **********It is not clear whether the House will accept the plant-closing provision. A sponsor of the proposal, Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, said, ''I don't have much doubt the House will accept this provision.'' But aides to the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, said the conferees from the House were expected to resist the plant-closing amendment. **********Democratic leaders in the Senate hope to have a final vote on the trade bill by the end of the week. But they got bogged down this afternoon on an unrelated amendment aimed at blocking the Administration's plan to provide protection for Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf. **********But this evening the Senate got back to trade, and that is when it made the surprise turnaround on import relief. **********On Tuesday the Senate accepted, 55 to 41, a proposal that would limit the President's discretion in refusing to grant relief to domestic industries hurt by imports. The relief, in the form of quotas or tariffs, would protect struggling industry from import competition. The vote took away the President's right to consider the national economic interest when deciding whether to carry out a recommendation from the International Trade Commission for relief. **********But this evening the Senate accepted an amendment offered by Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, that would allow the President to consider the impact of any import relief on the poor. For example, he could deny it if it would raise the prices of goods such as shoes, sugar or automobiles. **********Mr. Bradley said the amendment ''rolled back a lot of the action the Senate took on Tuesday.'' In explaining the change, he said senators found it difficult to oppose an amendment helping the poor. **********After this vote, on which there was no opposition, the Senate adopted an amendment of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, which allows the President also to consider the impact on agriculture of granting import relief. **********Mr. Yeutter, in a statement, said he ''welcomed'' the change. **********The House, in passing its version of trade legislation in April, approved an amendment that requires trading partners, such as Japan, to reduce their trade surpluses with the United States by a fixed formula if they persist in unfair trade practices. It was proposed by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, a Democratic Presidential candidate. **********This provision, if included in the final legislation, also seems sure to invite a Presidential veto. **********The plant-closing provision requires that companies with 100 or more employees give six months' notice before a plant closing or a mass layoff. The employee figure, according to sponsors, exempts about 85 percent of the businesses in the United States. **********A plant closing is defined as a layoff of 50 or more workers for 30 days or more. A mass layoff would idle one-third of a company's workers for 30 days or more. The notice requirement is waived if the company is seeking capital or business that would prevent the shutdown or layoff. And if it is caused by ''business circumstance,'' the company is exempt. **********Supporters of the amendment argued that it was necessary to give employees time to get the training necessary for new jobs. **********''If you think employees are just chattel,'' Senator Metzenbaum told his colleagues, and ''if you think you can fire people at will,'' then vote against the amendment. **********Mr. Metzenbaum also swept aside the threats of a veto. ''I don't think we should quiver and quake as to whether the President will veto the bill,'' he said. **********Senator Dan Quayle, the Indiana Republican who led the opposition, said the proposal was intended not to facilitate worker adjustment but to just keep the old plants open. Approval of the amendment, he said, would mean ''I say bye-bye to the trade bill.'' **********''We view this as an anti-competitive measure, imposing European-style government intervention in the marketplace when such policies have so clearly failed and led to economic stagnation,'' said Jeffrey H.

As a result, the year turned out to be one of the harshest for the banks since deregulation began in the late 1970's. **********''The industry is just not earning well,'' said Stephen Berman, banking analyst at Nomura Securities Inc. **********Most analysts are only marginally optimistic about the outlook for 1987. **********Even though the large banking concerns are expected to push harder to expand overseas and to win the right to underwrite securities, analysts see no slowdown in the exodus of large corporate borrowers from the banking system. They see no end to the debt problems of developing nations. They think that commercial real estate rents, which banks depend upon for repayment of development loans, will fall further. And they question whether fee-based businesses - an increasingly important source of bank revenue - will lift earnings. Flat Earnings Predicted **********Thus, the consensus is that the banks' financial condition will improve marginally, at best, or remain unchanged, at worst. **********''I'm looking for the banks' bottom-line earnings to be up only slightly this year, in the mid-single digits,'' said George M. Salem, banking analyst at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. **********''What you are seeing is stagnancy,'' said Donald C. Waite, one of the senior banking partners at McKinsey & Company, the management consultants. ''Bank earnings are stagnant, and as a result, returns are falling.'' **********To be sure, a few industry experts argue that the banks are performing well. They note that the banks' interest spreads - the difference between what they are earning on loans and paying on deposits - are holding up nicely. They also note that the banks have managed to maintain their absolute level of profits, if not increase them slightly, at a time when the lending world is still troubled by depressed commodity prices and overcapacity. **********''I would contend that a stable profit level is not the worst thing in the world,'' said Richard Stillinger, a vice president at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., a Wall Street firm that specializes in bank stocks. Key Indicators Are Down **********But such bank boosters are in the minority these days. The more common view is that the big banks are slipping, and the data certainly suggest that. **********At the 24 big banking companies followed by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, for example, return on equity fell last year to the lowest level of this decade - to 12.5 percent, from a peak of 15.3 percent in 1980. Loans written off as a fraction of average loans reached a record 0.80 percent, up from 0.36 percent in 1980. Return on assets of 0.73 percent, although up slightly from the level of 1985, was still well below its peak in this decade of 0.91 percent. **********Early last fall, the picture did not seem that grim. By chalking up huge gains from their bond portfolios in the first nine months of the year, while interest rates were falling, the banks appeared to be on the verge of matching the previous year's results. **********In the fourth quarter, however, the banks seemed to fall apart. Loan-loss provisions increased markedly, even as investment-banking income declined. Although many banks dug deeply into their pockets and found special items that helped to lift profits, over all earnings were still disappointing, analysts said. In fact, as the most exacting analysts tell it, even the banks now considered the most prosperous reported lower earnings on an operating basis. Special Gains Pad Income **********Consider, for instance, the Bankers Trust New York Corporation. The parent of the Bankers Trust Company reported net income of $1.39 a share in the fourth quarter. Those results, however, included a gain on the sale of a building, a gain from settlement of pension obligations, a benefit from the change in the tax law, and an above-normal increase in loan-loss reserves. As Mr. Berman of Nomura Securities sees it, Bankers Trust's true earnings were $1.03 a share, compared with $1.17 a year earlier. **********Even J.P. Morgan & Company, widely considered to be the nation's most successful big banking concern, had a tough quarter. Although Morgan reported earnings of $1.02 a share, Mr. Berman calculates that Morgan actually earned 87 cents in the year - compared with 93 cents in 1985 - after special items, including an accounting switch, are excluded. **********This type of analysis does not make bankers happy; indeed, many find it irritating. Yet, according to a number of banking experts, the results show that the nation's largest financial institutions are not doing as well as they were just a few years ago. Some Problems Are Clear **********Although the solutions will be difficult, the problems are well defined: While banks continue to lose business to alternative sources of funding, their remaining loans are going sour at an increasing rate. To offset these problems, the banks have succeeded in dominating certain areas of investment banking, such as interest-rate swaps, which generate big fees. But in addition to being keenly competitive, such fee businesses produce far more volatile results than traditional lending. **********As 1987 unfolds, many analysts expect little improvement in the banks' loan woes, so fee businesses will become even more important. A crucial issue will be whether the fee businesses will restore earnings momentum at the banks, whose stock prices and employee compensation are tied to profits. **********''Fees are becoming a more permanent part of banks' earnings,'' said Mr. Waite of McKinsey. But he added, ''What the banks won't be able to do is sustain the growth rate of fees.''

Films blocked by censors since 1981 are being released, and some artists and writers who shunned Government contact after martial law was declared are being asked to take tea with Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. **********The growing courtship of artists and writers is one of several Government initiatives that at the very least are intended to give the appearance of national reconciliation to foreign and domestic critics. **********The more cynical Poles, and those most committed to the opposition, are advising skepticism. They describe the new approach as a tactic. They say the Communists will never willingly relinquish their control over who can say what to whom. **********But there are many ordinary Poles who, however hesitatingly, are taking delight in the pronouncements of Aleksander Krawczuk, a classics professor from Jagellonian University, who as Minister of Culture for the last four months has been drawing much more from John Stuart Mill than from Marx or Lenin. Minister Not in the Party **********Mr. Krawczuk, who is not a member of the Communist Party, has, for example, declared that culture can only develop spontaneously and that its progress will not adhere to plan. This week, at a news conference, he went so far as to declare that this country's prolific underground and illegal press was ''a good thing.'' **********These remarks, made before 50 foreign and Polish journalists, harmonized to some extent with Soviet initiatives for openness, but they went far beyond anything heard in Moscow. They verged on an endorsement of Poland's bootleg cultural industry, which produces hundreds of publications, books and tapes in clandestine workshops. **********''I think it is good to have this second cultural realm,'' said Mr. Krawczuk, who is well known in the country as the host of television programs about life in ancient Greece and Rome. ''I think people should publish in the second sphere and people should read these things.'' **********His major complaint was that the underground press had not produced any masterpieces. ''Most things published in the underground are light, even superficial,'' he said. **********Asked whether, in light of his views of the clandestine press, there remained any justification for censorship, Mr. Krawczuk backtracked a bit. **********''Perhaps I exaggerated what I said about the usefulness of the parallel culture,'' he said. ''I am used to saying what I think. I have been a professor for 26 years and a minister for only four months. You may accuse me of naivete.'' Censorship 'Dying Out' **********As for censorship, Mr. Krawczuk declared: ''It is not only modest, it is dying out. Many critical articles are published. What is censored are insults against our allies and the authorities.'' The last two terms are widely understood to mean the Soviet Union and Poland's Communist leaders. **********''We are not happy about political censorship in this country, but in times of political conflict it is necessary,'' he said. ''It is now receding.'' **********When a Western reporter asked whether the minister's remarks at the news conference would themselves escape censorship in the official press, the question was answered by Jerzy Urban, the Government spokesman. **********''No one can guarantee the publication of this discussion, because it is up to the editors of each paper to decide,'' said Mr. Urban, who is also not a Communist Party member. Still Subject to Heavy Fines **********Mr. Krawczuk said the authorities had been very lenient with the underground press, leaving its writers or readers unpunished. He was then asked why the printers, and those who distributed the materials, were subject to heavy fines and the confiscation of cars. **********Since last September's amnesty of political prisoners, the size of fines for such offenses has grown. The seven largest underground publishers have responded by forming an underground insurance company to protect against such losses, which they jokingly refer to as Lloyds of Warsaw. **********Mr. Krawczuk said such fines and confiscations were not a form of censorship but rather penalties assessed for tax evasion on the part of the clandestine presses, some of which are large enterprises employing as many as 200 people full time. He was then asked whether these enterprises would be permitted to operate unhindered if they paid taxes. **********Mr. Urban again interceded to say there were questions of commercial law covering the registration of enterprises. On the issue of censorship, he said it was a question on the border line of law and politics. In constitutional terms, he said, everything that is not expressly prohibited is permitted, but he added that in practical terms the policy is evolving as the political situation eases. **********The Government has already increased allocations for culture by a third, released all but one of the films that were being kept from circulation because of their political content, and offered employment to theater directors who have not been allowed to run their own theaters since martial law was declared at the end of 1981. In addition, Mr. Krawczuk said he had taken the first steps to permit the re-establishment of the Polish chapter of the national PEN club, which was disbanded in 1981. Hard Line on Key Issue **********But if the general tone set by Mr. Krawczuk has been conciliatory, he came down on the side of the hard-liners on an issue that, more than any other, defines the limits of cultural reconciliation. It concerns an appeal by 62 literary figures for permission to form their own literary union. **********These people, including some of the best known writers in Poland, believe that they cannot in good conscience join in the official writers' union, whose members they largely regard as puppets of the Government, opportunists or collaborators. **********As is often the case, the controversy touched off by the letter does not deal with the essential argument. Instead, it was stirred by the contention made by Mr. Urban last week that the cause of these independent writers was harmed by the inclusion among the signers of Adam Michnik, the Solidarity figure whose political essays and literary criticism are being translated in many countries. Mr. Urban, himself a journalist, said last week that Mr. Michnik was not mainly a writer but rather a political figure. **********Mr. Krawczuk backed up Mr. Urban by saying, ''Strictly speaking, Mr. Michnik has published only political essays, not belles lettres.'' **********Mr. Michnik, who has written extensively on literary matters, said by phone from Gdansk that he wondered if Mr. Urban ''was truly qualified to pass on who was and was not a writer.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/04/business/caesars-bid-is-weighed.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1987-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 310, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Caesars Bid Is Weighed", "print_headline": "Caesars Bid Is Weighed", "body_text": " **********Martin T.

Freeman, 44 years old, director of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Company; Richard B. Wigton, 52, head of arbitrage at Kidder, Peabody & Company, and Timothy L. Tabor, 33, a former arbitrage trader at Kidder, Peabody, were each charged with four felony counts. The long-awaited charges included conspiracy to commit securities, mail and wire fraud and three counts of having committed securities fraud. **********Through their lawyers, each denied the charges in the indictment, obtained by the United States Attorney in Manhattan. **********A number of lawyers involved in the case, criminal law experts and Wall Street executives said they were struck more by what was not in yesterday's indictment than by what was included. The nine-page document repeats much of the information in the original complaint filed at the time of the traders' arrests, but it contains less information, in several respects, than that complaint. No Other Stocks Mentioned **********No new stocks were identified as the subject of the insider trading. As in the complaints, the only stocks mentioned were of the Unocal Corporation and Storer Communications Inc., and there was no reference to the Continental Group Inc. **********Martin A. Siegel, a former Kidder, Peabody investment banker, previously pleaded guilty to a charge that he had received an inside tip about Continental from Mr. Freeman, and then had Kidder, Peabody profit from trading in its stock. **********In subpoenas issued to the firms after the arrests, the Government sought information about more than 40 companies that had been involved in takeovers or were clients of the firms, sources with knowledge of the investigation have said. The sources said that subpoenas were also issued to individuals at each of the firms. **********In a search warrant obtained to collect records from Mr. Freeman's office in February, the Government also alleged that Mr. Freeman told Mr. Siegel he had created ''padded'' research files on stocks in which he traded illegally, so it would appear that the trades were based on legal information. **********Neither Kidder, Peabody nor Goldman, Sachs was charged in yesterday's indictment, despite the Government's allegation that they had profited from the trading. **********An arraignment of the three traders was set for next Thursday in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Would Be First Insider Trials **********The lawyers for the indicted traders said that they planned to fight the charges in court and insisted that their clients would be vindicated. Their responses indicated that the Government might face its first trials since the scandal blew up last May with the arrest of Dennis B. Levine, a former investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Up to now, 10 investment bankers or lawyers have pleaded guilty to felony charges or agreed to do so, without one case having gone to court. **********The indictment had been expected since the three were dramatically arrested, shocking Wall Street and heightening the nervousness created by the spreading scandal. **********Mr. Tabor was arrested at his Manhattan home late on Feb. 11 and Mr. Freeman and Mr. Wigton were taken from their offices on Feb. 12. **********All had been implicated by Mr. Siegel, a former senior investment banker and takeover specialist at Kidder, Peabody. He pleaded guilty on Feb. 13, the day after Mr. Freeman and Mr. Wigton were arrested. He also settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he had sold inside tips for $700,000 to the arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky. Siegel Only Known Source **********In its original complaint, the Government hinted that its charges had resulted from information provided by sources in addition to Mr. Siegel, although it did not identify the sources. Nor did the indictment issued yesterday refer to any other potential witnesses. The defense lawyers involved indicated that they looked forward to cross-examining Mr. Siegel, should he be a key Government witness. **********''From what I know there is substantial material that could be used to impeach Mr. Siegel's testimony,'' said Andrew Lawler, Mr. Tabor's attorney. ''We intend to enter a plea of not guilty and to aggressively litigate.'' **********According to the indictment, from June 1984 to January 1986 Mr. Siegel swapped tips with Mr. Freeman about pending takeover transactions on which their firms were working. Secret Details on Storer **********Mr. Siegel reportedly leaked secret details of a takeover involving Storer Communications to Mr. Freeman. Mr. Freeman is said to have then traded with that information, earning unspecified profits for himself, his family and Goldman, Sachs. **********In turn, Mr. Freeman is said to have tipped off Mr. Siegel about a takeover bid involving Unocal, a Goldman, Sachs client. Mr. Siegel is said to have passed this information to Mr. Wigton and Mr. Tabor, who used it to earn unspecified profits for Kidder, Peabody. **********''Mr. Freeman will plead not guilty, and we look forward to going to trial,'' said Paul J. Curran, Mr. Freeman's attorney. **********''Mr. Wigton will be found innocent,'' said Stanley Arkin, his attorney. Kidder, Peabody suspended Mr. Wigton without pay yesterday, pending a trial, the company said. **********Mr. Freeman remains a partner at Goldman, Sachs.

The new notes are expected to be rated triple A, like other securities backed by Financial Security. **********The cash payment, which will vary from day to day, depending on which perpetual issue is exchanged, will be used to pay Financial Security's insurance premium and to buy zero coupon Treasury or World Bank bonds that would retire the new 28-year floating-rate notes at maturity.

Shultz is expected to outline the proposal in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Shultz, according to the officials, is to ask Congress to approve the aid immediately after Sept. 30, when the current annual authorization of $100 million expires. **********Such a request is certain to trigger a fierce battle in Congress over continued support for the rebels, known as contras, who are seeking to topple the Soviet-backed Nicaraguan Government. Administration's View of Plan **********Nicaragua and four other Central American countries - Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala -last month agreed on a peace plan that would require an end to hostilities throughout the region and an end to all outside military aid to insurgents. **********The plan, modeled after a proposal by President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, also requires that commissions be established in each of the countries to reconcile political differences. The Costa Rican foreign minister, Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto, who is visiting Washington, asked Congress today not to vote on further aid until after Nov. 7. **********The Reagan Administration, which was taken by surprise when the five governments signed the agreement in Guatemala, has been wary of the proposal, contending that the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua could not be trusted to abide by such an agreement. **********Administration officials have said that in order for any peace accord to work, the contras would have to continue to receive financing in order to maintain pressure on the Sandinistas. **********Representative Jim Wright, the Speaker of the House, who is likely to take the lead in opposing any request for renewed aid, has urged the President to refrain from seeking new aid while the ''peace process is ongoing.'' There was no immediate reaction from Congress to the report of Mr. Shultz's proposal. **********Mr. Wright has invited the Costa Rican President to address a joint meeting of Congress later this month to press that point. Concern Over Funding Gap **********Under the Shultz proposal, new funds would be appropriated at the beginning of October so as to leave no gap in aid for the contras. According to officials, if the peace plan adopted last month appears to be succeeding, the money for the contras could be suspended on Nov. 7 or any time thereafter. **********The money could be used by the rebels for military purposes under the proposal. If at some time there was a cease-fire, officials said, the funds could be restricted to non-lethal uses. **********In that way, the officials said, the contras could be maintained as a political entity until they are integrated into Nicaragua's political system. Strategy Fails **********Underlying much of the maneuvering over the Central American peace plan has been the Administration's interest in renewing financial aid for the Nicaraguan rebels. **********Initially, the Administration had considered asking Congress for about $140 million for the next 18 months. As part of the Administration's strategy, President Reagan, along with Mr. Wright, offered a bipartisan peace plan, which was quickly overtaken when the regional leaders approved their own proposal. **********The Administration had expected Nicaragua to reject the Reagan-Wright proposal, thereby bolstering its case for additional aid. But the strategy went awry when the Central American leaders adopted their own plan. **********Immediately following their agreement, the Administration was uncertain whether it would request renewed contra aid. But after negotiations with Mr. Wright, President Reagan said he would not formally request aid until after Sept. 30. **********Several critics of the Administration, both in Congress and elsewhere, remain deeply skeptical whether the Administration is interested in a negotiated settlement or remains committed to a military solution in Nicaragua. Comparison of Plans **********The Central American leaders' plan affects disputes and issues in all the countries, but for the Administration and its opponents, the principal focus has been Nicaragua. **********In addition to the call for an end to outside aid for rebel groups, cease-fires and the establishment of national commissions to reconcile political differences, the peace plan requires amnesties and movement toward full democratic rights. **********It is generally seen as more favorable to the Sandinistas than the Reagan-Wright plan, which calls for an end to military aid to Nicaragua as well as an end to such aid to the rebels, and would seek an immediate suspension of emergency law in Nicaragua. The Reagan-Wright plan also envisions negotiations to restore full civil rights and elections in Nicaragua. Congress would be asked to resume aid to the rebels if there was no agreement on negotiations by Sept. 30. 'Political Space' **********Earlier today, Mr. Madrigal, the Costa Rican foreign minister, said that he hoped Congress would delay voting on renewed aid to the contras until after Nov. 7. . Mr. Madrigal said Central American leaders needed ''political space'' to implement their peace plan. **********He asserted that a Congressional vote on the issue of aid to the rebels before Nov. 7 would seriously hurt prospects for the Arias plan. **********Mr. Madrigal came to Washington at the suggestion of the State Department to meet with Secretary of State Shultz. In a 30-minute meeting today, the two officials discussed prospects for the Central American peace plan and Administration plans for renewed aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/04/business/market-place-closed-end-funds-lure.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1987-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 882, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CLOSED-END FUNDS' LURE", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE; CLOSED-END FUNDS' LURE", "body_text": " **********ARE closed-end investment companies the newest takeover prey? That's what some experts are asking in the wake of an unsolicited acquisition offer for the Japan Fund, a closed-end fund that seeks capital gains by investing in Japanese securities. **********It is the unusual nature of closed-end funds -their shares typically sell at a discount to net asset value - that apparently prompted the offer from a group including Thomas B. Pickens 3d, the son of T. Boone Pickens, the Texas entrepreneur. **********The group said on Monday that it owned 1.4 million of the fund's 28 million common shares, and it proposes to pay 95 percent of net asset value, or a 5 percent discount, subject to obtaining satisfactory financing. Prospective buyers also include John S. Grace, president of Sterling Grace Capital Management Limited Partnership, and Oliver R. Grace Jr., general partner of the Anglo American Security Fund Limited Partnership.  * * * Closed-end funds have been reorganized or liquidated in the past, and the goal of outsiders essentially is to close the gap between net asset value -or the dollar value of a portfolio divided by the number of fund shares - and the actual market price. If a group is successful, it can reap a profit on its original investment bought in the open market at a discount. **********The Japan Fund ended last week at a 19.7 percent discount. But the gap narrowed Monday as the stock rose $1.625, closing at a 52-week high of $17.375. Yesterday, the price was unchanged and, based on the net asset value of $19.83, the discount was 12.4 percent. **********In Wall Street, the thinking is that the Grace-Pickens group, rather than a takeover, really wants to force the Japan Fund into becoming an open-end investment company, or mutual fund. And the betting, in the words of one professional investor in closed-end funds, is that in this particular case the outsiders ''have less than a 50-50 chance of success.'' **********Yesterday, the Japan Fund said that its directors would meet Friday and that the proposal would be an item on the agenda. The fund's investment adviser is the Asia Management Corporation, an affiliate of Scudder, Stevens & Clark, the investment counseling firm. **********Thomas J. Herzfeld of South Miami, Fla., who manages nearly $100 million for clients in assets of closed-end funds, believes that activity in closed-ends may be heating up on another front - the single-country funds that went public in 1986 to invest in securities of specific nations. **********''Outside investors have acquired stakes of more than 5 percent each in the Italy Fund, the France Fund and the Scandinavia Fund,'' Mr. Herzfeld said. ''Each of these funds is selling at a discount and reorganization has to be regarded as a serious possibility. There's a chance, too, that some raider might come along and pay minority holders a premium for their shares.'' **********But the giants of the closed-end industry, such as the Tri-Continental Corporation, generally are considered immune from any forced reorganization. Effective control for some funds may reside in the hands of insiders. **********There are critical differences between a closed-end investment company and a mutual fund. A closed-end company has a set number of shares that were issued in an initial offering, and its price - like that of any stock - is determined by supply and demand in the open market. Doubling in size over the last 10 years, the closed-end industry in the United States has grown to include more than 100 funds with assets worth over $16 billion. **********But this sum is dwarfed by the mutual fund industry. According to the Investment Company Institute, mutual funds saw total assets, including those of money market funds, swell to a record $766 billion last year. **********Mutual funds are known as open-end investment companies because they stand ready to sell new shares to people who pay the net asset value - plus any sales charge in the case of ''load'' funds. When investors sell their shares, the mutual fund redeems these at net asset value. In some cases, an ''exit'' fee may be tacked on. **********Closed-end funds sell at a discount for various reasons. ''Stockbrokers would rather peddle mutual funds and rake in a fat commission, than do a one-time, long-term trade in a closed-end,'' said a market professional. ''In addition, closed-ends lack true sponsorship in Wall Street and specialized funds, such as single-country funds or bank-stock funds, may wane in popularity because of an overabundance of their type of products or for other reasons.'' **********Some closed-end funds, including the National Aviation and Technology Corporation in 1979, have been converted, thanks to shareholder pressure, into mutual funds. And, just recently, shareholders of Baldwin Securities, which had traded at a substantial discount, approved a change-over to an operating company. But last month an investor group that had sought control of Bancroft Convertible Fund ended its tender offer after a rejection vote by shareowners."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/09/business/business-people-goodyear-begins-management-shifts.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1987-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 354, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goodyear Begins Management Shifts", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Goodyear Begins Management Shifts", "body_text": " **********The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company yesterday announced moves to consolidate its management, including the appointment of a corporate vice president for worldwide tire manufacturing. **********William J.

The brokerage firm announced, though, that, as a result of several large, one-time gains, it produced an overall profit in the second quarter. **********In addition, William A. Schreyer, Merrill's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview that the firm would consider the sale of part of its asset management business, in which Merrill manages, for a fee, stock and bond mutual funds and money market accounts for its customers. **********Several Wall Street firms are considering selling a partial interest in their asset management operations, one of the steadiest sources of earnings in the brokerage business. Recently, Oppenheimer & Company sold part of its asset management business. Paine Webber Takes Steps **********And the Paine Webber Group Inc., which reported a very profitable second quarter yesterday, has recently taken steps to establish its asset management business as a free-standing entity, which would make it easier to sell part of the business. **********At the end of the June quarter, Merrill Lynch had $85.6 billion under management, $46 billion of which was in money market accounts. Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities, said that Merrill's asset management business would be worth about $3 billion. **********Mr. Schreyer said there were no talks under way for such a sale. But he indicated that Merrill's executives were continuing to analyze the profitability of the firm's separate businesses and that they would be open to the spinning off of all or part of the profitable money management business if it benefited that operation and the firm's shareholders. Share Buyback Expected **********Mr. Eckenfelder argued that it would, and he speculated that the firm might use the proceeds of such a sale to buy back some of its shares. **********''Over all, a sale of that business would benefit shareholders because you'd realize the value there,'' said Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services. Merrill Lynch's stock rose 62.5 cents yesterday, to $35.75, in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********For the second quarter, Merrill said that its earnings fell 8.6 percent, to $83.3 million, from $91.1 million in the comparable 1986 quarter. Earnings per share slipped to 76 cents, from 86 cents, a better performance than most analysts had expected. **********Over all, Merrill would have had a loss of $41.2 million for the quarter if not for profits from the sale of a large interest in its real estate business and part of its leasing business. **********Merrill reported a $76.2 million profit after taxes from the sale of part of its leasing portfolio, and a profit of $48.3 million from the sale of part of its real estate brokerage business. About $63 million of the reported gain from the leasing business sale came from tax credits. **********Merrill said its revenues rose 4.7 percent, to $2.44 billion, from $2.33 billion. Before taxes, Merrill earned $18.9 million, down sharply from $159.6 million the year before. **********Merrill reported previously that the loss before taxes from mortgage-backed securities trading, the largest in Wall Street history, came to $275 million. Merrill executives said said the $102 million difference reflected $76 million taken from a reserve fund and $26 million taken from a fund used to pay bonuses to its brokers and investment bankers. Move Raises Questions **********Questions were raised, though, about Merrill's use of the reserve fund, which a number of accounting experts and senior executives of other brokerage firms described as highly unusual. Since brokerage firms revalue their securities trading portfolios every day, these experts said, they are generally not permitted by their accountants to hold reserves against unspecified losses they might suffer. But Merrill's executives said they considered the reserve justifiable and prudent. **********Merrill had a strong quarter in some regards. Its investment banking revenues jumped to $292.9 million, from $231 million. Much of the gain came from the huge fees Merrill charged in several major merchant banking transactions during the quarter, involving the buyouts of Borg-Warner, Supermarkets General and Viacom. **********Merrill's insurance revenues soared to $217.9 million, from $83 million, largely because of increased income from the sale of single-premium deferred annuities. Paine Webber **********Paine Webber yesterday reported second-quarter net income of $17.6 million, or 53 cents a share, up sharply from $7.1 million, or 20 cents a share, in the 1986 period. **********Revenues rose 5 percent, to $637.6 million, from $607.5 million. **********Despite the bond market turbulence last April, Paine Webber reported higher revenues from principal transactions of $102 million, up from $97 million a year earlier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/31/business/a-long-and-winding-road-band-s-quest-for-stardom.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1987-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1856, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Band's Quest For Stardom", "print_headline": "A LONG AND WINDING ROAD; Band's Quest For Stardom", "body_text": " **********By 7:45 P.M. Madison Square Garden was filling with young, excited rock-and-rollers. A good omen, thought Steve Mountain, manager of the opening act, the Hooters, as he looked at the 18,500 seats. **********The Hooters, a rock band that had already had one million-selling album, was trying to make even more of a name for itself as it stepped on stage at 8 P.M. While its ''Nervous Night'' album had been successful, a rousing welcome at the Garden this hot summer evening, where the singer-guitarist Bryan Adams was the headline act, would bode well for the second album just reaching the stores. **********It was not just Mr. Mountain and the five members of the Hooters who were delighted that the audience was arriving in time to see the opening act. Rock-and-roll is a big business and CBS Records, the Hooters' label, stands to make a good deal of money from the band's success. Recordings a Linchpin **********Indeed, the overall profitability of CBS Inc. is heavily dependent on its records group, the largest American record company. As with the marketing of any new product, the key to this risky business is the selection and promotion of promising performers. **********Every year CBS releases perhaps 150 albums created by its roster of 200 artists. Some are already superstars - Bruce Springsteen, Cyndi Lauper, Michael Jackson, Billy Joel - and sales of their records are a certainty. **********''The superstar is the giant bonanza,'' said Al Teller, the president of CBS Records. ''The big hit is to develop superstar careers. That is the biggest win you can have.'' **********Superstars generate enormous profits for their record companies because revenue climbs dramatically as more albums sell, while production and marketing costs remain relatively fixed. Fueled by its superstars the records group earned $192.1 million in 1986 on sales of $1.49 billion. That accounted for 45 percent of CBS Inc.'s operating profits. Enjoying a Turnaround **********After several years in the doldrums, the recording industry is doing very well. Profits at CBS and Warner Communications, the No. 2 American record company, are at an all-time high, benefiting from both the success of new groups and the sales of compact disks. Sales of disks are up as customers replace their record libraries, and the profit margins on disks are higher than on either records or tapes. **********Nevertheless, Mr. Teller believes this is a particularly difficult time for promoting a new group. ''Once you break a group, you have to sustain it,'' he said. ''But public loyalty is more fickle than it used to be. It is tough to achieve longevity today.'' **********A major problem is overexposure. ''In the 1970's, groups were leery of going on television because it might overexpose them,'' he said. ''Today, it is difficult to estimate the long-term effects of videos. With MTV, the public can get oversaturated with a group sooner.'' **********Finding and nurturing hit groups is a harrowing business, and the casualty rate is high. Although CBS does not release figures, industry analysts estimate that it releases as many as 40 albums a year by newcomers, a third of whom are never heard from again. The benchmark indicator of a group's potential is whether it can sell 100,000 copies of an album. Advertising No Guarantee **********And while record companies are sophisticated in promotion and advertising, public taste is unpredictable. ''You can't advertise your way to success,'' Mr. Teller said. **********The jury is still out on the Hooters, which, despite its platinum album -the recognition accorded for selling one million copies - has not reached superstar status. ''You cannot be considered a superstar,'' Mr. Teller said, until you consistently sell out a 20,000-seat arena. The Hooters is not yet in that category. **********The band's second album, ''One Way Home,'' has been out for a few weeks, and early sales are encouraging but not exhilirating, with a total of 450,000 albums shipped to stores. The first single from the album, ''Johnny B,'' is getting a modest reception from radio stations. At those stations using the contemporary-hits format - the stations with the target audience of a group such as the Hooters - Mr. Teller said the airplay was good but ''not great.'' **********Irving Azoff, the chairman of MCA Records, noted that an act's second album was often not as successful as the first. ''A group can spend years writing and producing its first album, and six months on the second, because they are rushed to get it out,'' he said. ''That can hurt.'' Setting a Goal **********For the Hooters to succeed in its drive for superstardom, the new album must sell at least one and a half million copies. **********Concert tours can be a critical factor in producing such sales. Across the popular-music industry, the biggest stars on tour this summer are doing well. But the second-tier acts have been suffering. **********When CBS signed the Hooters, it put up a ''recording fund'' of about $200,000 for the first album. The group spent slightly more and paid the difference. **********According to Mr. Teller, deals are structured in that fashion to encourage groups to control production costs. Mr. Mountain, the Hooters' manager, said he thought CBS had also spent about $300,000 promoting and advertising the album. Video Costs Shared **********Record promotion these days also includes the cost of music videos, which run from $75,000 to more than $100,000. The record company and the performers generally share that expense. **********When a new group goes on tour, even as an opening act, CBS sometimes underwrites the costs - in order to promote record sales - if the group's expenses are not covered by their appearance fees. Mr. Mountain said the Hooters had not accepted CBS support for the tour because he thought he would have more leverage in future negotiations if it did not. **********The finances of a rock band can be complex. Although the Hooters' first album for CBS contained four songs that became hit singles, the Hooters' members did not become overnight millionaires. Indeed, given the four hit singles, Mr. Mountain said the one million copies sold was a bit disappointing. **********From that album, concert performances and royalties, the members of the group will take in more than $1 million. 'We Came Out Clean' **********Terms of the agreements between performers and companies vary widely. Mr. Mountain said CBS paid the Hooters a royalty fee based on 85 percent of the wholesale price, which is generally about $5. ''You don't get rich selling a million albums,'' he said. ''We recouped enough to pay off the recording fund and our share of the music videos and to make a profit. We came out clean. There are bands out there with very heavy debt.'' **********After recouping costs, CBS Records made $2 million to $3 million on the album, an executive at another record company estimated. **********For the Hooters, the path to success has been tortuous. Its five members are in their 30's. Only two, the keyboard player Rob Hyman and the lead guitarist Eric Bazilian - who write the songs - have been with the group since it was formed nearly a decade ago as Baby Grand. **********Arista Records, a unit of CBS, signed the group in 1978. Two albums were released. Both flopped, and the band was discouraged. ''By 1980, we had done two unsuccessful albums,'' Mr. Hyman said. ''We racked up a hell of a debt. We played lots of little clubs.'' Four years later, Arista canceled the contract. Sounds of Jamaica **********By 1982, the group had reorganized, still a five-piece band but with three new members. It emphasized reggae, Jamaica's popular music, and ska, an up-tempo Engish derivative of reggae. The band built a loyal following in Philadelphia, the home of several members, but still attracted no interest from record companies. **********A year later, friction broke up the band again and two replacements came aboard. At that point the group took the name the Hooters; the musicians say it is a reference to the melodia, one of the instruments they use. **********The band then hired Mr. Mountain. Managers generally get 20 percent of a group's revenues, for which they negotiate contracts with the record companies and booking agencies. They also handle personnel matters such as hiring and firing road crews for tours. **********The Hooters' visibility within the industry increased when Mr. Bazilian and Mr. Hyman were co-authors with Cyndi Lauper of her enormous hit recording, ''Time After Time.'' The collaboration came about because Mr. Bazilian and Mr. Hyman had attended college with Rick Chartoff, a CBS producer working with Ms. Lauper. **********The Hooters then took the somewhat unusual step of recording an album on its own. **********''We knew we needed a Hooters record,'' Mr. Mountain recalled. ''It cost us about $25,000 to make. The group did it in two weeks.'' The album sold more than 100,000 copies, primarily in the Philadelphia area. 'We Had Enough Buzz' **********Those sales were a clear indication that the group had appeal, according to both Mr. Teller and Mr. Mountain. **********''We made about $150,000 from the record,'' Mr. Mountain said. More important, he said, ''by then'' - it was September 1984 - ''we had enough buzz that record companies were finally interested.'' **********At CBS Mr. Chartoff was paying attention. Signing groups is a highly competitive business. Often, newcomers attract their first notice in small clubs. Once in a while, a group actually comes off the street. Spookie, one of the most recent acts to sign with CBS, used to perform on the sidewalk at Century Park West in Los Angeles in order to attract attention. **********A deal was negotiated with CBS, the first album was recorded, and discussions began on what song to release as the first single. ''We wanted people to sit up and take notice,'' Mr. Teller said. ''We knew it would not be a super hit, but we thought it would legitimize Hooters.'' **********Mr. Teller said radio programmers were quickly enthusiastic. Their response is the first hurdle for any new record. ''Generally once the programmers like it, they play it,'' Mr. Teller said. ''Then it is up to the audience.'' **********At that recent concert at Madison Square Garden, the audience liked what it heard, if the cheering and singing along were any indication. The Hooters ''will be a big group,'' said one fan, Anna Maria Santullo, after the performance. ''They're not flashy. But sooner or later, they will get there. They got what it takes.'' **********By another measure, the band still has a long way to go: Not until Bryan Adams strutted into the spotlight did female fans in the front rows start flinging their bras onto the stage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/08/business/company-news-imperial-oil-in-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Imperial Oil in Deal", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Imperial Oil in Deal", "body_text": " **********Imperial Oil Ltd., the Canadian oil company that is 70 percent owned by the Exxon Corporation, agreed to pay $680 million (Canadian), or $523 million (United States), for the assets of Sulpetro Ltd., a natural gas company in receivership since June.

''With Mr. Calero, I think it is clearly proven that we don't get the cohesiveness to conduct this struggle. This is not bitter infighting. This is a pragmatic attitude.''

Isaacson, manager of personal financial planning at Weber Lipshie & Company, a certified public accounting firm. ''The I.R.S. notice makes it clear that you are either an independent contractor or an employee, depending on your relationship with the company.'' **********The self-employed have long enjoyed certain tax advantages not available to payroll workers. Among them: Federal income and Social Security taxes are not withheld each pay period, special retirement programs such as Keogh plans can be established and deductions for travel, entertainment and other business expenses are easier to get. **********Of course, there are also some disadvantages, including the absence of health and pension benefits paid by or obtained through an employer benefit plan. But many, if not most, of those who have an opportunity to be taxed as independent contractors choose that route. **********Under the 1978 tax act, the prerogative of being taxed according to the self-employed provisions of the Tax Code was granted to many more men and women. So-called safe-harbor provisions in that law let them claim to be independent contractors for tax purposes if the kind of services they performed had been performed by independent contractors in the past. **********But last year's tax package was largely perceived as tightening the rules governing independent contractors, especially the technical service workers mentioned by category in Section 1706. Those specifically cited are engineers, designers, drafters, computer programmers, systems analysts and other such skilled workers engaged in a similar line of work. **********''The I.R.S. is now saying that things are not going to be mechanical,'' said David S. Rhine, partner of the certified public accounting firm of Seidman & Seidman/BDO, in discussing the revenue service's Notice 87-19 of Jan. 21. ''They will still look to the facts and circumstances of the individual case.'' **********Accountants indicate that a major factor will be the common-law standards relating to who is to be considered an employee. If the company obtaining the services substantially controls the work performed, if the individual runs no risk of losing money on a project or if the person performing the services works on the premises of the company, it may be unlikely that this person can recieve the tax benefits of an independent contractor. **********Also explained in the new I.R.S. notice is its interpretation of the Tax Reform Act that the paragraph covering technical service personnel deals only with three-party relationships. Such relationships involve a broker who provides assignments to individuals from clients, as opposed to a two-party relationship between an independent contractor who works directly with a corporation. **********''A person in this kind of a three-party relationship might want to use this opportunity to clarify his status,'' Mr. Rhine added. ''By fitting into this job category, it doesn't mean that you're necessarily safe as an independent contractor.'' **********Mr. Isaacson gave an example of a three-party situation in which a computer consultant works for a computer consultant broker, which then sells the consultant's services to a bank. The determination as to how the consultant will be treated for tax purposes - an independent contractor whose compensation is recorded on Form 1099 or an employee whose wages are listed on Form W-2 - will be based on considerations such as the percentage of the consultant's overall work that is done for the broker, he said. And when a person is deemed to be an employee, he cannot avoid that status by calling himself a sole proprietor, partner or other other such title. **********Experts advise individuals who fall into the I.R.S.'s classification of technical service personnel to be particularly careful in declaring their tax status as the new law takes effect this year. Questions should be discussed with the appropriate companies or brokers - or with the I.R.S. - in order to avoid potential problems later."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/22/business/bethlehem-says-chapter-11-is-possible-in-future.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1987-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 555, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bethlehem Says Chapter 11 Is Possible in Future", "print_headline": "Bethlehem Says Chapter 11 Is Possible in Future", "body_text": " **********The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, in an unusually pessimistic public assessment, said yesterday that external conditions could compel it to file for bankruptcy in the future. However, the nation's third-largest steelmaker asserted later that it had no imminent plans to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws. **********Bethlehem's statement came in a preliminary prospectus for an offering of 12 million new common shares, which would increase the total outstanding to 64 million. The company said it expected the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve the offering in four to six weeks, with the proceeds to be used for retiring long-term debt. **********Whenever a company makes such a filing, Federal rules require it to discuss its financial outlook. **********Without detailing its concerns, Bethlehem said: ''Future events may result in such adverse changes in Bethlehem's business circumstances or such a decrease in Bethlehem's liquidity as to make it prudent for Bethlehem to file a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.'' **********Bethlehem has incurred losses totaling more than $2 billion in the last five years. The company has attributed the losses to a combination of rising steel imports, worldwide steelmaking overcapacity, high labor costs and inefficient operations. **********Its recent results have been better. In July the company reported second-quarter earnings of $46.8 million, its highest quarterly profit in six years, on revenues of $1.12 billion. **********Nevertheless, Bethlehem has been a subject of frequent bankruptcy rumors. Those rumors were fueled by last year's Chapter 11 filing of the LTV Corporation, which operates the nation's No. 2 steel producer. **********Bethlehem's chairman, Walter F. Williams, has consistently denied that his company ever seriously considered such a step. He has previously acknowledged, however, that Bethlehem looked into the possibility of a bankruptcy filing earlier this year. **********Mr. Williams could not be reached for comment yesterday. A company spokesman, Henry H. Von Spreckelsen, said, ''We have never ruled out a bankruptcy filing, but we have no intention to file for Chapter 11 at this time.'' **********Bethlehem's latest assessment did not appear to alarm investors. The company's shares slipped 50 cents, to $16.625, on a day when the stock market as a whole was sharply lower. **********Officials of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Federal pension insurance agency, said Bethlehem had made its pension payments last week. Some people in the steel industry had expected the company to file for an extension as a move to delay its pension payments. **********Bethlehem, like other major steelmakers, has benefited from increased demand and higher steel prices in the last few months. And steel producers have reduced their production capacity, tightening the availability of certain products. **********Nonetheless, Bethlehem said it had had trouble raising cash through debt offerings. The company said it would negotiate new bank agreements to replace two current revolving credit pacts, under which borrowings totaled the $300 million maximum. **********Low bond ratings have impaired Bethlehem's ability to issue bonds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/19/business/futures-options-us-crude-oil-up-a-bit-nearing-20-a-barrel.html": {"writer_name": "Lee Daniels", "pub_date": "1987-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 451, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Crude Oil Up a Bit, Nearing $20 a Barrel", "print_headline": "FUTURES/OPTIONS; U.S. Crude Oil Up a Bit, Nearing $20 a Barrel", "body_text": " **********The price of the most important American crude oil posted a slight gain in thin and hesitant trading yesterday to inch closer to the $20-a-barrel level.

Steel, a commodities analyst at Refco Inc., said that one reason for that belief was that traders were uncertain about the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries when it meets in general session on June 25. Some believe the group will decide to raise the official price for its oil; others believe it will raise production quotas. **********Mr. Steel said that the $20-a-barrel level was also likely to be a strong resistance point because ''we'd be breaking out of the teens for the first time in a long time.''

Five others, including Mr. Tosh's companion, Andrea Marlene Brown, were wounded. **********Radio Jamaica said the attack appeared to have been a robbery attempt. **********Three armed men arrived on motorcycles at Mr. Tosh's home in St. Andrew, a suburb of Kingston, entered the house at about 8:30 P.M. Friday, and shot the seven people present after they refused to give up their money, the radio station said. **********A police detective said that Mr. Tosh had just returned from the United States and that the robbers apparently thought he had a large amount of cash with him. The detective added that the assailants had been tentatively identified, but that no arrests had been made. **********Prime Minister Edward P. G. Seaga extended his condolences to Mr. Tosh's family and friends, and former Prime Minister Michael N. Manley extolled the singer as a man who ''gave to Jamaica and the world an unforgettable library of musical works which will be played and sung by many generations of people.'' **********Mr. Tosh founded the Wailers in 1963 with Bob Marley, who died of a brain tumor in 1981. The Wailers' third star was Neville (Bunny) Livingstone. He left the group with Mr. Tosh in 1973 after Mr. Marley increasingly took over the starring role. **********More than 100 people gathered today at University Hospital, where the wounded were taken. **********The four others who were wounded were identified as Carlton (Santa) Davis, a drummer in Mr. Tosh's band; Jeff Dixon, a disk jockey for the state-run Jamaica Broadcasting Corp.; Mr. Dixon's wife, Yvonne, and Michael Robinson, another musician. **********Mr. Dixon, who had been shot in the head, was in critical condition, Radio Jamaica said, adding that the others were believed to be in stable condition. **********Mr. Tosh was born Winston Hubert McIntosh on Oct. 9, 1944, in Westmoreland, Jamaica. **********A baritone, he was perhaps best known internationally for collaborating with Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones in the Smokey Robinson song ''(You Got to Walk and) Don't Look Back.'' **********In the lyrics of his songs, he often condemned injustice and poverty and praised the Rastafarians, a Jamaica-based religious sect. **********Like other Rastafarians, Mr. Tosh advocated smoking marijuana. He recorded the album and single ''Legalize It'' in 1976 and often smoked huge marijuana cigarettes, called spliffs, on stage. **********In 1978, before a crowd of 30,000 in Kingston, which included Prime Minister Manley, Mr. Tosh smoked a spliff and berated Mr. Manley for 30 minutes for refusing to legalize ganja, as marijuana is known here.

In early 1975, he wrote the anti-police song ''Mark of the Beast,'' which was banned from Jamaican radio. **********In the time Mr. Tosh was with the Wailers, the group had a string of hits including ''Stir It Up,'' ''I Shot the Sheriff'' and ''Get Up, Stand Up.'' **********Many of the Wailers' songs were highly political, and the group was extremely popular in Jamaica. The Wailers' 1973 album ''Catch a Fire,'' won reggae, with its characteristic loping beat, an international audience. **********Mr. Tosh's first album in four years, ''No Nuclear War,'' was issued recently. His other albums included ''Equal Rights,'' 1977; ''Bush Doctor,'' 1978; ''Mystic Man,'' 1979; ''Wanted Dread and Alive,'' 1981, and ''Mama Africa,'' 1983. **********He was nominated for a Grammy award in 1985 for best reggae recording for ''Captured Live.'' **********The New Rolling Stone Record Guide described Mr. Tosh's solo albums as ''excellent, pure reggae, truer to the spirit and form of the music than Marley's more celebrated work.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/20/business/2-resign-at-merrill.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1987-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 238, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Resign At Merrill", "print_headline": "2 Resign At Merrill", "body_text": " **********Two more executives have left Merrill Lynch & Company in the wake of the staggering trading losses announced last month.

Gorbachev is not so easy as it used to be. **********''We can say anything we want,'' said Mr. Raikin, whose understated ridicule of Soviet idiosyncracies has made him perhaps the country's most beloved comic. ''But nobody is very interested. The newspapers are already saying it.'' **********Take the famous opening monologue of Mr. Raikin's comic review, always a winner with a pre-Gorbachev audience. The comedian, alone in a spotlight, wonders aloud if it would not be better to keep silent. **********''I could just keep my mouth shut for three hours, including the intermission,'' he suggests, in a wistful deadpan. ''We're all so good at keeping silent. Just the other day I met a friend - the things he was keeping silent about, well, I just can't tell you.'' **********These days, when a substantial portion of the Soviet population would probably welcome a bit of silence about domestic problems, the routine draws only a polite ripple of laughter. **********''Before, it was enough to just mention a problem,'' said Mr. Raikin's son and collaborator, Konstantin. ''Just to name a problem was an act of civic courage.'' **********So, at 75 years old, Mr. Raikin is after something new. A team of writers is working up fresh material for the audiences who invariably buy up every ticket in the 1,000-seat Moscow theater the state has given over exclusively to Arkady Raikin and his troupe. **********And if the doctors can be persuaded about the state of his heart, in September Mr. Raikin will make his first tour of the United States, doing 10 shows in seven cities, including New York, where he will be at Town Hall. 'Do You Know the One?' **********The doctors recently told Mr. Raikin, who is frail and trembles slightly from Parkinson's syndrome, that they did not recommend the trip, but he departed for a holiday in a sanitorium outside Moscow and hopes to be in shape by early September to fulfill his American contract. **********''You know the one about the two doctors?'' Mr. Raikin asks, by way of commentary on the medical bureaucrats who will decide if he goes abroad. Perched on a couch amid the books, art works and theatrical memorabilia that fill his eclectic apartment in central Moscow, he mimes the specialist hovering over the patient: ''Well, doctor, shall we treat him, or let him live?'' **********Mr. Raikin is generally regarded as a national treasure. His thick white pompadour is instantly recognized on the street by generations of fans. War veterans buttonhole him to recall that he entertained them at the front in 1943. Children's faces light up. Soviet television recently compiled a two-hour retrospective on him. **********Soviet leaders not otherwise known for thick skins have embraced Mr. Raikin, who has the wise fool's gift for jesting to the point of provocation, but not beyond. He knew Khrushchev well, and was a close friend of Brezhnev, under whose rule Mr. Raikin was made a Hero of Socialist Labor, the highest civilian honor. 'Stalin Liked Papa' **********''Stalin liked papa very much as an artist, even invited him to his birthday party,'' said Mr. Raikin's daughter, Ekatarina Raikin, an actress. She added, to her father's discomfort, ''Maybe that's why papa survived.'' Mr. Raikin was doubly unprotected: a Jew in a perilous profession. **********When he was younger, his routines featured Chaplinesque physical humor. His current show of skits and monologues, which has run for several years, features a satire of indirection and cocked eyebrow, more in the style of Jack Benny, with sentimental homilies and moral uplift. **********He twits the thoughtless overfulfilling of state economic plans in a skit about a Stradivarius factory that churns out dozens of bows a year -and two violins. **********In another routine, a psychologist shows up at the comedian's door to conduct a survey, and the interviewee is paralyzed by the fear that he might be found to have had an unconventional thought. To every question, from his political outlook to the number of sugar lumps in his tea to his relations with his wife, he warily replies, ''Just like all my friends.'' Now Daily Fare **********Another skit suggests that Soviet factories are run so incompetently the managers must be in the employ of foreign saboteurs. **********Mr. Raikin is well aware that his skewering of the mismanagement, alcoholism, conformity and general rudeness of Soviet society, humor that once upset the censors, is now daily fare in the official press. **********''Now you open Pravda and find a satirical article in every issue,'' he said. ''But when I did it in my time, they would say, 'Let's delete this phrase.' '' **********To keep up with the changes, he has ordered new material aimed at getting ''to the source'' of social dysfunction. He will not divulge details of the new material being composed by three leading comic authors, except to say, ''We want to continue being trailblazers, to be the vanguard.'' Hopes for Success **********This is unlikely to mean humor at Mr. Gorbachev's expense, however. Not because Mr. Raikin is leery of offending his leader but because, like many, he holds fervent hope that Mr. Gorbachev will succeed. **********For the American tour, on which his daughter and son will accompany him, Mr. Raikin expects the audiences to be primarily emigres. The shows will be mainly in Russian, although he can be expected to include several routines in English. **********A talented mimic, he has delivered entire shows in German, Bulgarian, Polish, Hungarian and - for BBC in the 1950's - in English, although he speaks none of those languages. **********His cousin, Steven Raikin, an American lawyer visiting Moscow this month, said he had dropped into the BBC archives to view tapes of Mr. Raikin's work in English. A Gentle Caricature **********''It's amazing,'' he said. ''You can tell that English is not his native language, but you would never guess he doesn't speak it at all.'' **********The senior Raikin obliged an interviewer by reciting one of his BBC bits, a gentle caricature of an emigre parent telling a child what it was like in the old country: ''Seasons? You call these seasons? There, we had seasons!'' **********Mr. Raikin said he had been approached many times about an American tour, but had never been granted official approval. He said the American impresario Sol Hurok visited him backstage in Leningrad, where the Raikin theater was based for 45 years before moving to Moscow, but when Mr. Hurok issued an invitation, the authorities told the impresario that Mr. Raikin's health was bad. **********''But at the time you knew nothing about it,'' prompted the comedian's grandson Aleksandr. ''You did not know they told him that.'' **********''No, then my bad health was an official secret, even from me,'' Mr. Raikin agreed with a wry smile.

He is accused of shooting and torturing hundreds of Jews and of stealing their valuables. **********In questioning in 1945 before he escaped detention, Mr. Schwammberger admitted that he had shot about 35 Jews, according to the Austrian police files. The files were obtained by the Anti-Defamation League and made available to The New York Times. Jewels and Gold From Inmates **********The files show he also admitted that sacks of gold and diamond jewelry found in his possession had come from Jewish slave laborers. **********Mr. Schwammberger maintained at the time that he had been ordered to shoot the Jews for trying to flee his camp, that he had been given the valuables voluntarily and that he had found other riches buried under a cellar. In some cases, he maintained, people had given him gold watches for repair. **********But statements made by camp survivors in 1946 painted a bestial picture of Mr. Schwammberger as commandant of two forced labor camps in Nazi-occupied eastern Poland in 1943 and 1944. Some of the statements have been sent to Argentina for the extradition proceedings under a 1973 West German arrest warrant. **********Witnesses said they saw Mr. Schwammberger execute and torture hundreds of Jews, set his dog on prisoners, and use a pliers to tear gold teeth out of prisoners as he accumulated a fortune in stolen valuables. **********Mr. Schwammberger, short, baldish and heavyset, but seemingly robust, was moved from a cell to a prison infirmary in La Plata last week because of what officials said was a heart condition. In a court hearing last Monday, Mr. Schwammberger showed identification papers in his own name and said that he had never hidden his identity. He said he had worked under his own name for a petrochemical company in the town of Lisandro Olmos, near La Plata. **********He lived in a modest house in the nearby community of Los Hornos before reportedly moving in with a son nearer to Buenos Aires and then moving into the interior. He was captured on Nov. 13 on a ranch near Cordoba, in the interior, by the police and a federal judge, possibly as the result of a tip. The West German Government, which prosecutes war crimes committed under the Nazis, recently doubled its reward for information leading to his capture, to more than $300,000. Dossier Is Given to Argentina **********At a news conference last month in Israel, the Simon Wiesenthal Center named Mr. Schwammberger as one of its most wanted Nazi fugitives and said he was believed to be in Argentina. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Los Angeles-based center met with the Argentine ambassador in Washington on Friday and turned over a dossier on the case, including witnesses' accounts. **********The postwar documents from Austrian police files and Mr. Schwammberger's SS file in West German archives were collected over the years by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. Interest in them grew after Mr. Schwammberger's capture, and copies were made available last week by Elliot Welles, director of the League's Nazi war criminals task force. Escaped Detention After War **********The police records show that Mr. Schwammberger, carrying false papers in the name of an army sergeant, was initially arrested on a tip in Innsbruck, Austria, in the French occupation zone on July 19, 1945. He escaped with two other suspected war criminals from the Oradour detention camp, near Schwaz, during the night of Jan. 2-3, 1948. It is not clear how he made his way to Argentina. **********An Austrian, he joined the Nazi party in 1933 and became a member of the SS elite guard four years later. In 1943 and 1944, he admitted, he operated SS labor camps at Przemysl in Poland, near the Soviet Union, where Jews were forced to clean and repair German Army uniforms; and at Mielec, nearer to Cracow, where the Germans operated an aircraft factory with forced Jewish labor. Jews Had to Be 'Shot by Me' **********Jews sometimes fled Przemysl but most were quickly recaptured and ordered shot, Mr. Schwammberger said in a statement that appeared to bear his signature. ''There were differences of opinion regarding the shootings,'' the statement continued, ''for which reason my command issued the order that all Jews who fled from my camp had to be personally shot by me.'' **********''During my duty as camp commander, it was a question of approximately 35 Jews, who, according to the order, had to be shot by me.'' **********The statements quote Mr. Schwammberger as saying that the killings took place in a field. The prisoners stood facing a wall and were shot in the back of the neck, usually from less than 10 centimeters away, about four inches. The bodies were buried in mass graves. Police Seized Valuables **********When he was arrested in 1945, the police seized eight sacks that contained pearl, gold, silver and diamond jewelry, including watches and wedding rings, and gold coins, plates of tooth gold and other items. **********An appraisal obtained by the police valued the cache at about 50,000 marks in 1945. Mr. Welles of the Anti-Defamation League estimated that the jewelry would be worth more than $150,000 today. He said the Austrian Government auctioned off the jewelry for a pittance as unclaimed property, even though many of the pieces bore initials and other identifying marks. **********Asked to explain the valuables found in his home, Mr. Schwammberger told the Austrian police in 1945 that he had uncovered some buried in a cellar and received others for taking ''some Jews out of the ghetto and putting them with me in the work camp,'' according to the signed statement. He said they were given to him by ''the Jew Goldmann,'' ''the Jew Teich,'' ''the Jew Jonas,'' and ''the Jew Reinharz,'' among others. Roundups for Execution **********But camp survivors offered sharply different accounts, statements taken by the police in 1946 showed. Siegfried Kellermann, a 27-year-old cook from Przemysl, said that in September 1943 he watched from hiding as Mr. Schwammberger lured starving Jews out of the ghetto with promises of resettlement and then rounded them up for execution. **********The SS built a bonfire and made the Jews undress and surrender their jewelry, Mr. Kellermann said. Then, he said, Mr. Schwammberger and other officers shot the men and women, often not fatally, and threw them alive into the fire. Children, he said, were grabbed by an arm or a leg, their heads were smashed against a wall and they were thrown into the flames. **********''In this method and manner 900 people were murdered,'' he said. Ashes Sifted for Gold **********Afterwards, he said, the victims' ashes were sifted for any remaining gold. He said he later came out of hiding, was arrested and sent to Przemysl, where he became a driver for Mr. Schwammberger, often delivering packages of gold and jewels to Mr. Schwammberger's relatives. **********The commandant, Mr. Kellermann said, tried to get his 8-year-old son to help him with the killings but the boy refused, saying he did not like to shoot other children. **********Another survivor, Heinrich Kirschenbaum, a 24-year-old truck driver who was freed from Mielec, told the authorities the camp had food shortages because Mr. Schwammberger took the camp provisions and sold them in Mielec. He said received 100 lashes for being caught with a packet of coffee. **********Mr. Kirschenbaum said the commandant ordered his dog to ''roll him over'' for the whipping. ''He always set the dog, Prince, on the inmates. It leaped on people and tore out entire pieces of their body parts.'' **********Once, he said, his uncle, also a prisoner, had a napkin tied around his jaw because of a toothache. ''Schwammberger took a look and thereby established that my uncle still had four gold teeth in his mouth, which he then simply tore out that same day with a pliers.'' **********The uncle, Salamon Balsam, then 43, corroborated the incident in his own account. He also recounted an incident in which Mr. Schwammberger's horse ran against the camp's electrified fence and was electrocuted. Mr. Schwammberger, Mr. Balsam said, demanded that the oldest Jewish prisoner immediately find him another or he would be shot. **********Another Mielec inmate, Low Chiel, a 21-year-old apprentice locksmith, said 50 Jews at the camp who had been caught hiding valuables were shot. **********''We were further oppressed with a tax of 50,000 zlotys,'' Mr. Chiel said. ''If we didn't come up with it, he would shoot 20 or 30. We didn't bring the demanded sum and he shot 15 Jews.'' Sick Inmates Were Shot **********Unlike at other Nazi concentration and work camps, Mr. Chiel said, there was no sick call at Mielec. Sick inmates were shot. **********He said he was put on a burial detail for one of Mr. Schwammberger's mass shootings. ''Therefore I saw how naked people were driven in the open one kilometer from the airplane factory,'' he said. ''The shooting was by shots in the head. We were ordered to shovel out the graves in five minutes or we would also be threatened with shooting.'' **********''I was interned in various camps during the Nazi time,'' he said, ''but I have never experienced such bestial treatment as by Schwammberger.'' **********It was not clear how many of these witnesses are still alive or could be found 41 years later. But others, hearing of Mr. Schwammberger's arrest, have recently come forward."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/18/business/article-173187-no-title.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1987-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 736, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Article 173187 -- No Title", "print_headline": "Article 173187 -- No Title", "body_text": " **********Salomon Brothers, Wall Street's largest securities firm, lost about $100 million during the violent plunge in bond prices in April, according to analysts and Wall Street officials with knowledge of the firm's activities. **********Salomon Brothers thus became the third major securities firm known to have suffered major losses during the tempestuous two weeks in April when a becalmed bond market suddenly tumbled. **********The swiftness of the plunge clearly caught even some of Wall Street's shrewdest players off guard; the president of one major securities firm estimated that Wall Street's losses for the month may have approached $1 billion. **********Merrill Lynch & Company said in late April that it had been hit with an unprecedented $275 million loss. And on Tuesday the First Boston Corporation acknowledged that it had also taken a beating, which sources close to the firm put at $100 million. Profit for Quarter Seen **********John H. Gutfreund, Salomon Brothers' chairman, had conceded in late April that the month had been extremely tough, but he had not acknowledged any losses. Yesterday Robert S. Salomon Jr., the firm's chief spokesman, would say only that the firm's profits for the second quarter would be down from the period a year earlier. **********He added that because of First Boston's announcement, Salomon had decided to confirm that its profits would decline. First Boston had said it would show an overall loss for the second quarter because of losses from trading in Treasury bond options. Mr. Salomon said, however, that Salomon Brothers would still show a profit over all for the three-month period. **********Analysts immediately cut in half their profit estimates for Salomon Inc., Salomon Brothers' parent. **********Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities, said he had lowered his estimate for Salomon's second-quarter earnings to about 40 cents a share, or $60 million, from 75 cents. In the second quarter of last year, Salomon Brothers earned 78 cents a share, or $117 million. Stocks Decline **********Mr. Eckenfelder said he had calculated that Salomon Brothers probably lost $75 million to $100 million in April from bond trading losses and reductions in revenue because of low trading volume in April and May. Sources close to the firm said yesterday that the figure was more than $100 million in trading and revenue losses and that, over all, Salomon Brothers had lost more than $40 million during April before taxes. **********Salomon's stock price fell to $34.25 yesterday, down $1, as word of the reduction in earnings spread. The stock price of First Boston, which made its announcement after the market had closed on Tuesday, fell to $44.75, down $1. **********Merrill Lynch had suffered its losses from trading in a new kind of mortgage-backed bond, and First Boston mainly from complex Treasury bond options. Neither of the innovative instruments has been well tested in a down market. Behind the Losses **********The Wall Street sources said that Salomon Brothers' losses had come from a variety of areas, but particularly from municipal bond trading. **********The municipal bond market suffered particularly acute problems in April for two reasons: first, because it had less trading volume and thus less liquidity than some other bond markets, and second, because of the growing role of municipal bond mutual funds. **********The lack of liquidity led to a situation where, as the selling gained momentum last April, prices were cut faster in the municipal, or tax-exempt, bond market than in other areas, such as Treasury bonds. **********This trend received further impetus when thousands of individual investors redeemed their holdings in the municipal bond mutual funds. The wave of redemptions forced the funds to sell hundreds of millions of dollars of their bonds, adding significantly to the downward pressure. **********Some hint of the industry's difficulties came in early May, when Edward Ozog, an assistant vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, addressed a gathering of the Public Securities Association. Mr. Ozog, who reviews the records of the primary Treasury security dealers, said the major firms had not reported much profit in the first months of the year because of the lack of trading volume."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/31/business/advertising-calet-hirsch-spector-gets-rorer-assignment.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Calet, Hirsch & Spector Gets Rorer Assignment", "print_headline": "Advertising; Calet, Hirsch & Spector Gets Rorer Assignment", "body_text": " **********Calet, Hirsch & Spector/New York has been assigned Myoflex analgesic cream by Rorer Consumer Pharmaceuticals.

Many of the networks have not yet gained solid control over costs, quality and accountability, industry spokesmen and consultants agree. And there are still few role models and little governmental enforcement to guide them. **********Preferred provider organizations, most of which are less than five years old, are a blend of health maintenance organizations and traditional fee-for-service insurance plans. An employee is offered a limited, or ''preferred,'' group of physicians and hospitals in return for improved benefits, such as lower deductibles and lower fees. The employee has a wider choice of medical providers than under traditional H.M.O. plans. And the cost can be far lower than that of traditional fee-for-service plans, whose premiums have begun to soar anew. The employer's incentive is a discount from the doctors and hospitals. In theory, even the medical provider wins because of a higher number of patients. **********Though preferred provider groups have received far less attention than H.M.O.'s, they are now available to more than 30 million people, according to the American Association of Preferred Provider Organizations. H.M.O.'s serve more than 25 million. In the last year the number of preferred provider groups has doubled, to 700. The field, once dominated by small networks of physicians and hospitals, is now being overrun by commercial insurance companies, which often team up with medical providers, and by Blue Cross-Blue Shield. **********Indeed, the preferred provider organization is quickly swapping roles with the open-ended fee-for-service plan that had long been the mainstay of American health care. By 1990, 40 to 45 percent of Americans who have health insurance through their employer will be covered by preferred provider organizations, up from 4 percent in 1985, while the share for traditional plans will fall to 5 percent, from 72 percent, Peter Boland, a health-care consultant in Berkeley, Calif., predicts. **********Many companies offer employees the option of a preferred provider organization, traditional plan or an H.M.O. Others, including Honeywell Inc., have kept only preferred provider groups for some employees. **********But although many employers have bought the preferred provider concept, some are not yet satisfied. ''Our experience is that the P.P.O.'s can be managed much more efficiently than they are,'' said Walter B. Maher, director of employee benefits at the Chrysler Corporation. **********The problem, Mr. Boland said, is that most of these networks have relied too heavily on discounting and not enough on reviewing the performance of the participating doctors and hospitals. ''The insurer and the employer have a difficult time getting meaningful operational and cost data,'' he added. Moreover, he said, there has not been enough effort to weed out doctors who have tried to make up for the lower fees by, say, arranging two appointments for a patient when only one was necessary, or whose treatment did not keep a patient from getting sicker and running up further bills. Indeed, it is in ambulatory care - care outside the hospitals - where cost and quality controls are weakest, industry experts agree. As a result, preferred provider organizations have often fallen short of the 15 to 40 percent savings expected over traditional plans. **********But experts are optimistic. Many preferred provider groups are learning to track more closely the performance of participating doctors and hospitals and keep them in line. Some networks are now moving toward an incentive system for doctors similar to that of H.M.O.'s that emphasizes efficiency by withholding a certain percentage of fees and giving the money to doctors only if they meet certain cost and quality goals, said James A. Hester of Pilgrim Health Care, an H.M.O. in Norwell, Mass. Indeed, some experts say systems combining the fixed-price, prepaid aspects of H.M.O.'s and the discounted fee-for-service features of a preferred provider organization will become more common. **********As the preferred provider industry matures, exemplary models are emerging. Mr. Boland mentions CAPP Care, based in Fountain Valley, Calif., and Benefit Panel Services in Los Angeles. At the same time, studies like one being conducted by the Rand Corporation will further identify what works. And Mr. Boland is leading a panel developing accreditation standards for the industry. **********But some say that self-monitoring is not enough. ''As far as regulation goes, P.P.O.'s have in a sense fallen through the cracks,'' said Nancy C. Turnbull, a Massachusetts deputy commissioner of insurance. She added that virtually no state monitored preferred provider groups for features such as financial disclosure, access to emergency medical care within a network and grievance mechanisms. She is backing a bill to give the state authority to license preferred provider organizations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/09/business/international-report-japan-s-raises-seen-at-a-low.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan's Raises Seen at a Low", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT; Japan's Raises Seen at a Low", "body_text": " **********Japanese workers, the world's highest paid, will probably receive their smallest wage increase ever this year, economists say. **********Faced with a growing threat of unemployment, they are likely to settle for an increase of around 3 to 4 percent for the year starting in April, well below last year's 4.5 percent and the previous low of 4.4 percent in 1983.

Indeed, by then, Mrs. Caplan's sales alone had passed 1 million pounds, the kiwi had become a major crop in California and the fruit could be found in 84 percent of the nation's supermarkets. **********Now the California Kiwifruit Commission, a state agency, has even bigger plans. **********''We've already converted the people who are easy to convert,'' said Dennis Palmer, the account executive handling the commission's campaign at Evans/Kraft Inc., an advertising agency in Seattle. ''Our job now is to get the people who aren't experimental in what they eat.'' **********Apparently, there are still plenty of those people around, even for the kiwi. According to Mark Houston, president of the kiwi commission, Americans consumed less than one kiwi each in all of 1986. **********Mr. Palmer's strategy is to cast kiwis as normal, everyday fruit, easily comparable to apples and oranges. Print advertising in the campaign began to appear last year in Sunset, a magazine popular in many Western states, as well as in People. **********The ads pictured kiwis in lively conversations with other fruits. In one, a banana boasts about its high potassium content. The kiwi tartly responds, ''I'm loaded with potassium and a taste that beats you, monkey fruit.'' **********''We want to develop an image, a personality for the kiwifruit,'' said Mr. Houston, whose group spent $1.2 million on the print campaign and other advertising in 1986. **********Earlier print campaigns were limited to women's magazines and pictured kiwis in salads or as garnishes, always as a supplement to other foods. Now, Mr. Palmer said, kiwis are being touted as snacks that can be picked up on the run and eaten on their own. **********''People need to start thinking of it as an everyday product if we're going to sell all that fruit,'' said Mr. Palmer, referring to the huge rise in kiwi production in the past several years. In 1980-81, about 8 million pounds of California kiwis were sold; in 1985-86, the figure was 34 million. The state is now the world's biggest producer after New Zealand. **********Mr. Houston is betting that the kiwi, which he called a ''feisty little character,'' will easily make the switch from exotic to mainstream, and that he will achieve his goal of putting a kiwi on every plate. **********''Look at the banana,'' he said. ''There was a time in the 1950's when people thought that the banana was an exotic specialty.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/15/business/business-people-retiree-returns-to-fill-in-at-mci.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1987-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 428, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Retiree Returns To Fill In at MCI", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Retiree Returns To Fill In at MCI", "body_text": " **********V.

Known in the United States for automobiles, Volvo also makes industrial, marine and aerospace products and is active in energy, food and banking. Last year Volvo earned $237.9 million before taxes on sales of $12.71 billion. **********Mr. Gyllenhammar has also used Volvo as a platform to promote European business in general. He is founder and chairman of the European Roundtable, 27 executives who lobby European governments in favor of railway, bridge and tunnel investments, freer trade and harmonization of standards and taxes. During a trip to New York, he talked about the international business scene. **********Q. Do laws limiting the use of Swedish profits overseas inhibit Volvo? **********A. They are being relaxed rather quickly. A lot of people have said we are locked in with Swedish cash we can't move. It's not true. There has never been an investment we wanted to do outside Sweden that has been blocked by the Bank of Sweden. The burden has been that we sometimes had to borrow because we couldn't use the Swedish crowns, which has made some investments more expensive. But the other side of the coin is that Scandinavian assets have been rated at a lower price. We have been able to buy good-quality food companies at 6 to 10 times earnings when internationally they go at double that cost. So it has made sense to expand at home. **********Q. The European Roundtable has a specific agenda, including a bridge-tunnel connection joining Scandinavia to Germany. How are your proposals going? **********A. Our infrastructure program has been discussed within the European Commission as a blueprint for their program. We did a joint study with them on financing that may be important in the long run. We have also supported group research projects and raised venture capital. We can't be corporate marriage brokers, but we can work to make it easier to do business in Europe. Q. In doing business today, how helpful are European governments? **********A. Government attitudes are much more positive than even five years ago, and there's no comparison with the 1970's, when they could think only in terms of subsidies. It's still very slow in tax harmonization and standardization. **********Environmental affairs are another area. We cannot live with a Western Europe where standards differ widely. The Roundtable has to go into this area because industry is seen as a polluter. Q. What about labor?  A. Problems come up when people are threatened. Sweden has next to full employment. We don't know how people would protect their jobs if unemployment would increase. **********There is another problem: organizing modern manufacturing. It's hard to state ahead of time who should be a metalworker and who white-collar. The responsibilities merge if you are a programmer and foreman in charge of a $10 million piece of equipment. We may need to encourage unions to merge as the workplace merges jobs. Q. Will that be tougher in Europe than the United States? **********I don't know. In the U.S. you can still fire people if you don't need them. In Europe you can't reduce your work force through dismissals unless a business is hopeless, so the dialogue will be more complicated. However, well-managed European firms have learned more about working with their employees because you can't dispose of them. Understanding employees is one of the keys to organizing work differently. **********Q. What is your view of the international financial scene? **********Over the last 24 months we have had to live with currency fluctuations that are unheard of in modern history. It's very dangerous for industrial growth. Business today is already encouraged to look too much to the short term. What's happening in the foreign-exchange markets doesn't help.

On Friday, he told a West German reporter with a smile that the timing of a visit ''is my best-kept secret.'' **********Thin though his comments were, Mr. Honecker's suggestion that a visit was once again in the offing was immediately seized upon in West Germany, and most speculation focused on early fall as the time a visit might possibly occur.

But they said Mr. Honecker would not have casually raised the question. **********''Mr. Honecker put the question on the agenda, and I assume he is earnestly interested in making this visit,'' said Eduard Lintner, chairman of the ruling Christian Democratic party's committee on inter-German relations. **********What gave Mr. Honecker's comments added weight was that he made them directly after a meeting in East Berlin of leaders of the Warsaw Pact, which was attended by Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union. Having been barred from visiting Bonn by the Kremlin in the past, West German officials said, Mr. Honecker must have received some sort of green light from the Soviet leader before speaking out. Nuclear Deal Is Cited **********Other conditions that appeared to make a visit feasible included the recent decision by the West German Government to support American-Soviet moves toward a deal on ridding Europe of medium-range missiles, and the prospect of a Soviet-American agreement. A state visit to Bonn last week by the Bulgarian leader, Todor Zhivkov, was viewed by West German officials as a good omen, since last time Mr. Honecker canceled a planned visit to West Germany, in September 1984, Mr. Zhivkov also canceled his visit. **********During the Parliament debate on medium-range missiles last Thursday, the head of the opposition Social Democratic party, former Chancellor Willy Brandt, spoke of a Honecker visit next fall as a fact. It was not clear whether Mr. Brandt was acting on concrete knowledge or on supposition. **********In 1983 and again in 1984, Mr. Honecker postponed visits to West Germany. Though the stated reason was some unfriendly comment or gesture by West Germans, it was generally accepted that Mr. Honecker had been denied permission by the Kremlin. **********Though he was the East German official responsible for throwing up the Berlin wall in 1961, in recent years Mr. Honecker has sought to improve inter-German relations. A state visit to Bonn would cap his career. **********But Mr. Honecker is generally considered to have less independence in foreign policy than other East European counterparts, in part because of Soviet suspiciousness of the Germans and in part because of 400,000 Soviet troops in East Germany. **********In April 1983 and again in September 1984, his plans to visit West Germany ran into conflict with with Moscow's vitriolic propaganda campaign against the emplacement of American medium-range missiles in Europe, which included charges that West Germany was succumbing to ''revanchism,'' the Soviet propaganda term for seeking a return to the past. **********More recently, Mr. Honecker declined an invitation in April to attend celebrations in West Berlin marking the city's 750th anniversary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/14/business/greenspan-s-inflation-view.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 298, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greenspan's Inflation View", "print_headline": "Greenspan's Inflation View", "body_text": " **********The economy's long-ailing industrial sector is rebounding smartly, but there is still no evidence of significant inflationary pressure, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, said today. **********''We are not yet approaching anything close'' to the economy's productive capacity, Mr. Greenspan told a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Congressional leadership council.

H. Robins Company last week, most people speculated that the deal collapsed because of concern about potential liability to thousands of women with claims related to Robins' Dalkon Shield contraceptive device. **********But while neither Robins nor American Home Products will say what led to the withdrawal of the bid, others close to the deal say that it collapsed not because of the Dalkon Shield liability, but because of the extensive demands made by Robins. **********''Robins's attitude to the bid was that the family farm is not for sale at any price, and that is a breach of the company's fiduciary duties,'' said one lawyer involved in the bankruptcy whose sentiments were shared by several others close to the deal. ''The withdrawal of the bid was really the loss of a golden opportunity to resolve all the claims in a reasonable way.'' **********Indeed, the most startling aspect of the proposed acquisition was the speed with which American Home Products reached an agreement with representatives of the Dalkon Shield claimants - an agreement that has eluded Robins since those claims, now numbering more than 327,000, pushed the company into bankruptcy court in August 1985. **********Under the proposed bid, American Home Products was to put more than $1 billion into a trust to pay the Dalkon Shield claims and, in return, was to be insulated from all future liability to women who used the intrauterine device. Without such a trust, most legal experts say, any successor to Robins would be engulfed in years and years of litigation over the personal-injury claims. **********Even with the trust, American Home Products might not have had ironclad protection against claims. For there has been immense controversy within the legal profession over whether a company in bankruptcy can use such a trust to resolve all claims - including possible future claims. **********Still, according to Murray Drabkin, who represents the Dalkon Shield claimants in the bankruptcy, it took less than 24 hours to reach agreement with American Home Products on a trust arrangement, indemnification provisions and injunctions against future lawsuits that both assured claimants that they would be compensated for their injuries and made the bidding company comfortable. **********''The possibility of future claims was still there, in metaphysical terms, but as a practical matter, the risk level was so low it was not a major factor in the deal,'' said Mr. Drabkin. **********Generally, under the the doctrine of successor liability, a company that takes over and continues the business of another company becomes responsible for the liabilities that arose out of the normal course of that business. But Robins pulled the Dalkon Shield off the market in 1974, and lawyers differ on whether claims related to the contraceptive device would be considered to arise out of the business the buyer continued. To further complicate matters, different states have different laws on the subject. **********''It just ain't clear,'' said Elihu Inselbuch, who represented the personal-injury claimants in the Manville Corporation's reorganization, another bankruptcy stemming from product-liability claims. ''In Manville, the investment bankers asked, 'What's the deal on successor liability?' and we told them what the law was, but that didn't really answer the question, so they decided to discount the stock by 25 percent.'' **********Manville also faced the problem of future claims. Courts generally have jurisdiction only over the actual claims that are before them, and many legal theorists believe that since a court cannot decide a case that does not yet exist, no bankruptcy court can rule that a future claimant would not have the right to sue the buyer, but would, instead, have to seek compensation from a special trust. **********Indeed, the legality of that arrangement is now on appeal in the Manville case, where hundreds of thousands of future claims are expected from those who have been exposed to asbestos but do not yet know of any injury. Since it can be 30 years after exposure before asbestos-related injuries develop, it is impossible to know exactly how many claims there will be. **********The Dalkon Shield situation is simpler. A few future claims are likely, however, from those who used the contraceptive device as teen-agers, or in their early 20's, and only now, in their 30's or 40's, are trying to have children and finding out that they are infertile. Most injuries related to the contraceptive device, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, became apparent while the device was in use. **********But since the device has been off the market so long, and most women who used it are now past childbearing age, the number of future claims is likely to be small. ''You're dealing with something on which the biological clock is eliminating potential plaintiffs every day,'' said one lawyer involved in the Robins bankruptcy, ''so the problem of latent injuries just isn't that big,'' **********Despite all the legal problems, Victor Schwartz, a Washington product-liability lawyer, believes the courts will uphold the use of trust funds to compensate victims of mass product-liability problems, since most of the parties involved - including the judges who would otherwise have to hear thousands of individual lawsuits - seem to believe that such a resolution is in everyone's best interests. **********''The law goes where the law wants to go, and the law wants to be able to put a line around these things,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/31/world/terry-waite-and-iranian-aides-said-to-figure-in-discussions.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Terry Waite and Iranian Aides Said to Figure in Discussions", "print_headline": "Terry Waite and Iranian Aides Said to Figure in Discussions", "body_text": " **********Asian diplomats here say talks have been under way in West Germany to determine the whereabouts of four Iranian diplomats who have been missing in Lebanon since 1982 and whose fate has been linked to that of the Anglican envoy Terry Waite. **********Mr. Waite, a envoy of Robert Runcie, the Archbishop of Canterbury, disappeared in January while trying to negotiate for the release of hostages. **********In an exchange this month with Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Archbishop Runcie promised to use his contacts to find the missing Iranians.

But it has tried. **********Last year, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of San Salvador won the agreement of the army and leftist guerrillas to permit Tenancingo, then a bombed-out ruin left to weeds and to the sun, to be repopulated as a neutral town - a place in a divided country where both sides would agree not to wage their aging war. **********The healing effort, in one of the dozens of villages in the countryside broken and emptied by the fighting, was heralded as a faint, much-needed sign that a small gesture toward peace was still possible after seven years of civil conflict. But now Tenancingo appears in danger of falling back between the warring sides. **********The army and guerrillas have both violated their pledges of neutrality. First the guerrillas came to hold political meetings and military formations. The army quickly replied by sending troops to guard and occupy the town for the last seven months. Villagers say both sides have informers in the town, and a few peasants in nearby areas have been killed by the rebels and the army, on suspicion of aiding the other side. Politics of War Condemned **********Now, the people of Tenancingo seem sick of taking sides. They condemn both the rebels and the soldiers for bringing the politics of the war back to them. ''When the army comes, the soldiers say they are here to protect us from the guerrillas,'' said Andeas Rauda, an aging woman who is rebuilding her former home. ''When the guerrillas come, they say they are protecting us from the army. What we wish is that all who carry weapons would stay away.'' **********But it looks as if the army intends to stay, spurring fears among villagers that the guerrillas may decide to attack at any time, as they did in the past, to maintain control of the area 25 miles northeast of the capital. Controlling this area gives them influence in the center of the country. **********Army-reinforced firing positions now dot the edge of town and it seems only a matter of time before someone will get hurt. A burst of bullets fired by a nervous soldier last week almost hit a sleeping boy and a few days later an Army land mine killed a cow near the town center. Other mines killed and wounded three soldiers who lost their way earlier this year. An Independent Agency **********The organization overseeing the repopulation of the town and the community's effort to rebuild itself is the Salvadoran Foundation for Development and Low-Cost Housing, known as Fundasal, one of the few effective independent agencies in the country. Its director, Manuel Sevilla, is so concerned about the army's violation of the neutrality accord that he has sent several letters to the high command and says he is considering pulling out of Tenancingo if troops remain. He made the same protests to the guerrillas last year. **********''Tenancingo was a symbol of peace,'' Mr. Sevilla said in an interview. ''Now it is becoming a symbol of loss of hope.'' **********''The fact is that neither the Government nor the guerrillas want Tenancingo to be a success,'' he added. ''They don't want to see it repeated elsewhere in the country. The guerrillas do not see the success of a neutral town as positive and the Government does not want a solution it does not control.'' **********Earlier this year the local army commander tried to establish a permanent, formal garrison in the village. Instead, the army opted for constant patrols that offer de facto control of the town without the political controversy of a permanent base would bring. Army Asserts a Right to Stay **********Mr. Sevilla said his organization would leave immediately if the army were to build a base and may leave anyway to protest the continuing army presence. **********An army spokesman denied in an interview that the army had ever agreed to respect Tenancingo as a neutral town. The spokesman said the army had the right to remain in Tenancingo as long as it pleased, since ''there is no agreement that says we can't.'' **********Mr. Sevilla and several townspeople say, however, that the original pledge to the archbishop by the army and the guerrillas that the town's neutrality would be observed was the main reason almost 600 of the town's original estimated 3,000 inhabitants returned from the refugee camps and urban slums. They had fled following past guerrilla attacks and the unrestrained air force bombing four years ago that killed more than 40 villagers. Repaired the Church **********With international assistance directed by Fundasal, returning villagers have repaired the rocket-shattered church, planted surrounding fields, started cooperatives for weaving and rebuilt the school and several bombed-out houses. **********There is no other example in the country of a village that has so quickly and successfully worked to regenerate itself. But the rubble of broken adobe homes, bomb craters and the gashes left by hundreds of bullets remain to remind townspeople of the war. And the sound of distant firing, the harsh chop of passing army helicopters, as well as thudding bombs and mortars, warn that the war is not ending. **********At the same time, signs of the current uneasy peace can also be seen in Tenancingo. Villagers sit and chat under the large trees in the town square, now covered with rows of blooming orchids. Children step over empty army food ration cans to play soccer in the school yard, and peasants try to ignore the fighting in order to tend their fields. **********''It is our home,'' said a town councilman who asked that his name not be used. ''But really, we all know that we are risking our lives in remaining here. We have suffered before, and we know we may sufer again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/26/business/finance-new-issues-s-p-reduces-ratings-of-6-banking-concerns.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 230, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.&P.

Late one recent night, Abdul Jalil and his neighbor's young wife, Khurshida Ali, were caught as they tried to elope, shaming their families and their village of Bholail, which is about 10 miles south of Dhaka. **********Now they faced the judgment of an ancient trial system known as salish, where village elders, mostly tradesmen and small landowners, would exact justice that could include a public whipping or slapping and a forced realignment of the marriages involved. **********As the salish began, Mr. Jalil, a helper on a minibus who thinks his age is about 25, squatted at dusk in a small courtyard, surrounded by the men and boys of the village as the elders, smoking expensive imported cigarettes, discussed his crime. 'She Tempted Me' **********''I hardly even know her,'' he said of Mrs. Ali. ''She tempted me into it. She made advances.'' The women, who play a secondary role in this Moslem society, were hidden in an adjacent building. Mrs. Ali, if her testimony was needed, was to speak into the courtyard through a darkened window. **********The salish, increasingly rare in Bangladesh, represents an attempt by village leaders to maintain their traditional feudal control and to cling to age-old customs - such as the subordination of women - in a slowly modernizing nation. **********It is an illustration of the distance that remains between thousands of isolated villages and the structures of government, which have yet to reach much of the country with paved roads, electricity, water and administrative control. Police Are Not Trusted **********Recourse to the salish also demonstrates a local mistrust of the police, who are described as corrupt and abusive, and of the government court system, which villagers said is slow, complicated and alien to their customs. **********''I am a poor man and I cannot afford to go to the police,'' said Tamizuddin, the father of Mr. Jalil's wife, Hamida. **********''If we go to court we will be trapped in the system,'' said Mr. Tamizuddin, who is a farm laborer. ''The most powerful forces will win and there will be no justice.'' The Antagonists Balk **********But like the courts of the distant cities, the salish snagged this night on a technicality when the aggrieved husband, a bicycle-rickshaw driver named Mohammad Suruj Ali, failed to appear. **********Two nights later, the salish was again delayed when the accused himself refused to take part. **********As a monsoon downpour brought a luminous early dusk to the village and green rice fields, the other principals gathered at the house of a village elder, a cosmetics salesman named Guyashuddin Ahmed, to discuss the case. **********Standing almost unnoticed among them, in the shadows by a postered bed, was Mrs. Ali, a slight woman of 18 with delicate features, wearing a faded red-print sari. The Young Woman's Tale **********A visitor asked for her side of the story. **********''I ran away because my husband couldn't provide for me,'' said Mrs. Ali, the daughter of a subsistence farm laborer. ''I hardly even know the man.'' **********''My godmother persuaded me to do it,'' she said without expression. ''I didn't want to go. The boy talked me into it. He said he would take the responsibility. He took me by force. He beat his wife and blood was coming from her mouth and nose.'' **********Indeed, Mr. Jalil had recently received a warning from a session of the salish for having beaten his wife, and Mr. Tamizuddin had taken her away from him. **********From behind a curtained doorway across the room came a woman's low voice: ''Don't believe her. She's a loose woman. She is lying.'' 'She Played Around' **********''I am not,'' said Mrs. Ali just as quietly. ''I had work in a garment factory.'' **********''She didn't work,'' said the voice from behind the curtain. ''She played around. She's a slut. Someone said, 'Come with me,' and she went.'' **********''It's not true,'' the young woman said, cracking her knuckles as she spoke. ''He forced me to go with him.'' **********''Don't believe her,'' said the voice. ''These are the stories she prepared for the salish.'' **********Subhan Sardir, a member of the salish, removed his glasses in a gesture that brought silence to the room. **********''We may or we may not whip them,'' he said of the offending couple. ''But we will probably force them to marry.'' 'Who Will Feed You?' **********''Will you marry him?'' he said, turning on Mrs. Ali. ''You won't? You won't go?'' ''I won't,'' she said. ''How will you eat, all alone in the world?'' he asked. ''Who will feed you?'' ''I'll find some way,'' she said. ''You ran away with that boy and now you refuse to marry him,'' said Mr. Sardir, brandishing a large flashlight and raising his voice. ''You know me. I'll bet you never got a real whipping from your father. I'll show you what a real whipping is.'' He turned to the visitor. ''She'll accept,'' he said. ''She must accept. She has put the whole village to shame and it is our obligation under Islamic law to rectify that shame. We will force her to marry him, and force him to marry her.'' **********At that point Mrs. Ali's husband, the rickshaw driver, entered the room. A soft-spoken man of 25, he looked everywhere but at his wife. 'A Very Simple Girl' **********''Will you take her back?'' Mr. Sardir asked him. ''No,'' said Mr. Ali quietly. ''I feel sorry for her,'' Mr. Sardir said. ''She's a very simple girl and she was deceived by fancy words. But we are doing what we must do.'' **********''She is a fallen woman now and nobody else will marry her,'' he said. ''It's the boy's responsibility now to take her as his wife and support her. Otherwise she will starve.'' Mrs. Ali remained standing in the shadow by the bedpost, one bare foot crossed slightly over the other. Both Are Flogged **********When the salish convened again, the village elders tried to persuade the accused man and woman to get married but they declined. **********Mr. Jalil and Mrs. Ali were flogged in public, he 30 times and she 20 times. Mr. Jalil was fined as well. **********''I want my wife back,'' he told the salish. But his father-in law, Mr. Tamizuddin, said his daughter would never go back to such a man. **********Mrs. Ali said, ''I'll work as a maid servant to fend for myself and will never marry again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": "Pamela Hollie", "pub_date": "1987-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 723, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROSPECTS", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS", "body_text": " **********ESOP's Edge Up **********More employees than ever are joining ESOP's, or employee stock ownership plans. This year, about 8.6 million workers will participate in ESOP's, says Corey Rosen, executive director of the National Cener for Employee Ownership in Oakland, Calif. **********One reason for the rise, Mr. Rosen says, is better ESOP financing. **********A provision in the new tax code makes it easier for bankers to bundle and market the loans sometimes made to ESOP's for stock purchases: Investors in these debt instruments may now deduct 50 percent of the interest income they collect. **********With more investors interested, the loans -and ESOP's - will get larger, Mr. Rosen says. Recently, the management of the Hospital Corporation of America proposed the largest ESOP yet, a $1.8 billion transaction involving 20,000 employees. **********Such big ESOP's could flex considerable muscle. Mr. Rosen pointed to the proposed buyout by the pilots' union of United Airlines as an example. That proposal set off a chain of events that forced Allegis, United's parent, to announce it would sell its hotels and rental car businesses. In the words of Mr. Rosen, soon other employees in ESOP's may be saying, ''If you don't do what we want, we'll buy you.' ''  Swaps at Thrift Units? **********Property foreclosures are still rising. In the first quarter, the Federal National Mortgage Association reported 8,315 residential and commercial foreclosures, 1,000 more than a year ago. So savings and loan associations, which grant many real-estate loans, may be ready for a version of the debt-for-equity swaps sometimes used by large banks to settle foreign debts, says William A. Kilpatrick, president of Green Mountain United Financial Operations, a real estate investment firm in Littleton, Colo. **********In a typical swap, a thrift unit would trade a foreclosed commercial building or apartment house for shares of a company looking to buy income-producing property at a discount. This way, liabilities are turned into assets on a thrift unit's balance sheets, said Mr. Kilpatrick, adding that ''at least 20,000 to 25,000 properties are available for this kind of swap.'' **********But not every thrift unit will use swaps. ''There are regulatory restraints,'' said Brian Smith of the United States League of Savings Institutions in Washington. Though swaps could work under certain circumstances, he says, Federally insured thrift units, for example, cannot own stock directly.  The Ultimate Export **********Because 20 percent of Japan's population will be over age 65 by the year 2000, Japan, the world's largest exporter, is considering a new export: retirees. **********The ''Silver Colonies'' under consideration at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry would help retirees achieve a ''comfortable, soul-enriching'' life in countries like Australia, Spain or possibly the United States - places where property is less expensive and the cost of living is lower than in Japan. **********But there may be problems, says Ruri Kawashima at the Asia Society in New York. Even though 16 percent of 50-year-olds who responded to a M.I.T.I. survey in Japan said they would consider living in a Silver Colony, the details of medical care and housing have yet to be worked out. And ''it would require a government-to-government agreement'' to overcome such obstacles as immigration laws, she said. **********At any rate, construction for the colonies is not scheduled to begin until 1990, said Ms. Kawashima, and by then, as the obstacles become clearer, ''enthusiasm may cool.''  One 'Olympic' Only **********With the Olympic Games approaching, the U.S. Olympic Committee will be more aggressive about protecting its exclusive right to the word ''Olympic.'' **********''Any use of the name is illegal,'' said George Miller, executive director of the U.S.O.C. in Denver. Indeed, the Supreme Court backed up this view a week ago with a ruling against the five-year-old San Francisco-based ''Gay Olympics.'' **********Disputes are likely. Thousands of American businesses have ''Olympic'' in their names - including more than 60 in New York City alone. **********''We can't go after them all,'' acknowledged Mr. Miller. The main targets, he says, will be athletic contests and businesses that link themselves to the games and thus affect the U.S.O.C.'s ability to merchandise goods, sell sponsorships and raise money. Mr. Miller points out that the Greek airline, Olympic Airways, is outside the committee's jurisdiction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/18/business/reorganization-at-tv-retailer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reorganization At TV Retailer", "print_headline": "Reorganization At TV Retailer", "body_text": " **********Home Shopping Network Inc. said today that it planned a major reorganization that would make it a diversified holding company.

Mr. Takeshita, who was elected by Parliament on Friday, suggested today that he felt the same way, but he never said so explicitly. **********The closest he came was an observation that he was ''looking forward to seeing that an agreement between the United States Government and the Congress is reached soon on reducing the budget deficit.'' **********In the last week, the dollar has set new record lows against the yen almost every day despite the Bank of Japan's massive purchases of dollars in a vain attempt to stop the slide. **********At the close of trading here on Friday, the dollar stood at 135.50 yen, a slight improvement from an all-time low of 134.40 reached earlier in the day. It means that the dollar is worth little more than half what it was two and a half years ago. **********For Japanese, their soaring currency has been unremitting bad news, for it makes their products significantly more expensive abroad. **********Earlier this year, corporate profits tumbled as Japanese businesses deferred price increases to keep their exports competitive against overseas competitors. At the same time, unemployment rose, especially in manufacturing industries, where the strong yen took its most severe toll. Bad Times May Return **********After the yen stabilized over the last few months, there were signs of economic recovery. But with some currency dealers and economists predicting that the dollar will soon drop to 130 yen, Japanese worry that bad times will return. **********Ironically, it was Mr. Takeshita who presided over the most precipitous slides in the dollar's value last year and the year before. He was the Finance Minister at the so-called Plaza accord of September 1985, when the major industrialized countries agreed to let the dollar find a significantly lower level. **********Another agreement reached last February, known as the Louvre accord, set ranges for the dollar against other currencies, which to the Japanese implied somewhere around 140 yen. Mr. Takeshita said today that Japan would continue to abide by that agreement, and would intervene in the exchange markets to bolster the dollar. **********''How much and when is a matter that I will decline to tell you,'' he said. ''The influence of intervention into the market is great only when we keep these things secret.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/03/business/eased-bank-laws-urged.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Eased Bank Laws Urged", "print_headline": "Eased Bank Laws Urged", "body_text": " **********A House of Representatives committee has recommended sweeping changes in the nation's banking laws, criticizing present laws that bar banks from the securities business and other industries as anti-competitive and potentially dangerous to their financial soundness. **********The House Government Operations Committee, in a report adopted Tuesday and released today, recommended changes that would allow federally insured banks and thrift institutions to operate as part of corporations that also owned securities or non-bank financial firms. **********The report, which did not propose specific legislation, comes as Congress prepares to debate bills revising Federal banking laws. **********The report is based on a study by the panel's Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs, whose chairman, Representative Doug Barnard, Democrat of Georgia, is a member of the House Banking Committee. **********Federal laws prohibit banks from owning or being owned by a company that is not related to banking and ban most banks from being affiliated with securities firms.

Mr. Mulroney, then six months into his first term as Prime Minister, was riding the wave of the biggest election victory in Canada's history, a landslide in which his Conservatives had swamped the Liberals, winning 211 parliamentary seats to 40. **********Although lacking the cosmopolitan wit of the former Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a Liberal, Mr. Mulroney, a former corporate executive who speaks French as well as English, had presented himself as well equipped to manage Canada's complex problems of language, regional economic disparities and a sense of nationhood fraught by proximity to the United States. **********But now, the Prime Minister, his Cabinet shaken by political scandals and by popular doubts about his policies, including a bid to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States that will be at the center of the talks with Mr. Reagan, finds himself hitting depths in the public-opinion polls that Mr. Trudeau never reached. 'This Is a Bruising Business' **********A poll this week by The Globe and Mail, Toronto, gave Mr. Mulroney a 23 percent approval rating, down from 70 percent in November 1984, and insiders in the Conservative Party have begun to worry privately that he cannot win another election. **********If he fails, it will be the third successive time in 50 years that the Conservatives have been ousted from office, each time by the Liberals, after a single parliamentary term. **********''This is a serious, bruising business,'' the Prime Minister, 47 years old, said this week in a two-hour interview with a group of American reporters. He added, ''We've been to the mountaintop, and now we're coming through a valley, and obviously there are moments that test your resolve, your character and your confidence.'' **********Whether Mr. Mulroney can recover before the next election, probably in 1989, is likely to depend in large measure on his success in negotiating a trade agreement with the United States. He said in the interview that an agreement lifting all tariff and nontariff barriers on the $129 billion in annual trade was ''a win-win situation'' for both nations. Fear for Canadian Institutions **********But many Canadians fear that tens of thousands of jobs here could be lost as cheaper American products compete equally with Canadian goods. **********Recent statements by United States trade officials have stirred concern that the United States could use a free-trade pact to mount a broad attack on the subsidies and other forms of Government aid that have kept many Canadian industries going. **********More than that, some Canadians believe many of the country's distinctive institutions are at stake, like its broadcasting networks, its ''cultural'' industries and its national medical care and welfare systems. **********Mr. Mulroney has said that Canada is ''not a shrinking violet of a country'' that could lose its independence because of a trade pact. But even some of his advisers feel that he has pledged too much on his relationship with the United States and that a more wary approach to Washington, of the kind often adopted by Mr. Trudeau, might be politically advantageous. 'I Like Ronald Reagan' **********In his personal relationship with Mr. Reagan, Mr. Mulroney has held to attitudes that many Canadians consider unbecoming. **********''My position is well known and hasn't changed,'' the Prime Minister said in the interview. ''I like Ronald Reagan, I admire many of the things that he's set out to do and accomplish. He's a straightforward, honest, honorable man who has done a great deal for the United States and the Western alliance and a great deal for Canada.'' **********Mr. Mulroney's sharp decline in popularity perplexes some political analysts here. He has had a series of Cabinet embarrassments, most recently involving a junior minister from Quebec who was dismissed in January amid a multimillion-dollar land scandal. No Worse Than Trudeau **********But the seven ministers who have been forced out or resigned because of conflicts of interest, allegations of incompetence or poor judgement is no worse than Mr. Trudeau experienced at a time when he was still relatively popular, Mr. Mulroney points out. **********Mr. Mulroney's defenders say that under his leadership Canada has progressed on key fronts. Unemployment is down two percentage points, to 9.5 percent. And Canada has one of the West's highest rates of economic growth, more than 3 percent last year, a positive trade balance and a decline in the large Trudeau budget deficits. **********The Prime Minister has produced Government studies suggesting that a trade agreement with Washington could create 500,000 new jobs and ease unemployment rates of close to 20 percent in areas of the Maritime provinces, Quebec and British Columbia. **********In the interview, Mr. Mulroney said he was confident that Canadians would eventually ''start adding all this up,'' with a resulting climb in his standing and that of his party. **********Referring to the next election, he said, ''If you're looking for the Prime Minister of Canada in a couple of years, you're going to be looking for me.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/16/business/markets-shut-tomorrow.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Markets Shut Tomorrow", "print_headline": "Markets Shut Tomorrow", "body_text": " **********American stock and commodity markets will be closed tomorrow in observance of Good Friday.

The cremation ceremony was planned according to Hindu traditions. **********But soon another ancient tradition came to be invoked when the 24-year-old man's distraught widow placed herself - or was placed - on the funeral pyre. Villagers say she died in the flames, chanting a mantra pledging loyalty to her husband of eight months. **********It was a sati, or immolation by a widow, the first in many years. The act was denounced by the authorities, newspapers and women's groups, reviving a debate on why superstitions survive even among the educated and well-off. **********But here in the plains of Rajasthan, home of India's old princely states and the relatively prosperous and well-educated Rajput warrior caste, the 20-year-old widow, Roop Kunwar, has became a saint and her cremation site a shrine. **********''The loss has made me sad,'' said her father, Bal Singh Rathore. ''But there is grandeur associated with sati and my family's name will be famous all over. Just as we bathe in water, she bathed in fire. She has taken her husband with her. They both live.'' **********By truck, bus and camel cart, at least 10,000 villagers each day have descended on Deorala to pay their respects and make offerings. Today, more than 100,000 jammed the area for the traditional final ceremony for a sati, at which the flames, kept alive since Sept. 4, were doused with milk. One of Roop Kunwar's silver and scarlet shawls was draped over the ashes. **********''Sati is not possible for all women, only those who are very blessed,'' said Ratan Kunwar, a 58-year-old mother of two from a nearby village, in a typical comment. ''I have come here for the blessings of this holy place.'' Police Arrive Too Late **********Outlawed since 1829, sati occurs now in India only once or twice in a decade, almost always in the Rajput community. Usually, word gets out in advance, and the police arrive to prevent it. In Deorala, the police arrived late, prompting women's groups to question their willingness to trample on local sensitivities. **********''The status of women has been set back by this event,'' said Suman Krishan Kant, secretary of the Women's Grievances Council in New Delhi. ''Given the attitudes of men and other social factors, the condition of women in India is poor as it is. The families and officials who didn't stop this should be punished.'' **********In fact, under pressure from women's groups, state authorities did act belatedly Tuesday to outlaw any attempt to ''glorify'' the immolation. The police have also arrested the dead man's 16-year-old brother for abetting a suicide, and officials say they will soon arrest his father as well. **********But no one tried to prevent the closing ceremony this morning or stop anyone from attending. Hours afterward, women and their daughters continued to throng the area as young men in brightly colored turbans, holding their swords aloft, circled the cremation site and shouted, ''Victory to the sati.'' Makeshift Shops Spring Up **********Nearby, in a carnival atmosphere, dozens of makeshift shops had sprung up, and hawkers were selling ice cream, trinkets and the most popular souvenir of the day: a montage photograph of Roop Kunwar smiling sweetly over the body of her husband. **********By local standards, the Rajput family thrust into prominence by the events of Deorala is hardly poor or illiterate. Roop Kunwar had passed her examinations after 10 years of school, and her husband, Maal Singh, a high school graduate, was looking for a clerical job. **********Like most Indians, they had a marriage arranged by the family. At the ceremony last January, he wore a gray suit and tie and her face was draped with gold jewelry. The room in their village house here was viewed all week as a shrine by visiting pilgrims. In the corner was a color television set. **********Each day, the couple's relatives have held prayers near the cremation site and have shared with villagers their view that their children have escaped the Hindu cycle of birth and rebirth and gone to heaven. Legends Start to Grow **********Details about how the sati occurred have become a matter of uncertainty and contradiction, with the story changing as the police press their inquiry. Inevitably, myths and legends have also grown up, to the effect that Roop Kunwar has sent messages from heaven and helped to cure pilgrims of diseases or mental disorders. **********Initial accounts were that Maal Singh's father and brother helped Roop Kunwar. Now the father denies he was even present at the ceremony. There have been rumors in Jaipur, the nearby capital of Rajasthan, that she might have been drugged or pressed into it. **********Others note that the cremation occurred only hours after her husband's sudden death, which followed assurances by doctors that he would recover. In this view, the stunned young bride, a devout woman who read from Hindu scriptures every day, may have been susceptible to emotional pressure. **********Among the villagers here, the word was that the family tried to dissuade her, but that she seemed determined and possessed with the spirit of God. Many said that trying to stop her would have invited an evil curse. **********''No doubt this is a bad thing in this modern age,'' said Madan Lal Gupta, a village schoolteacher. ''But she herself was willing to do this act. Nobody forced her. Now there may be some miracles, and many big good things may come to us.'' **********Still others note that the life of a widow in the Rajput community is a bleak one. By custom, widows may not remarry and must often live in seclusion, unable to eat meat or any sweets or enter into family festivities. In some cases, they have to sleep on the floor in the home of their in-laws. The Stuff of Legends **********The concept of sati is said to have arisen in prehistoric times. According to legend, Sati was a wife of the Hindu god Shiva who killed herself because her father had insulted her husband. The act of immolation was first mentioned in the ancient Hindu epics, and the earliest historic case was recorded 2,300 years ago by invading Greeks. **********Among the ancient beliefs that sati may have reflected were the idea of a wife as a husband's possession, and the notion that a man could take his possessions to the next world if they were burned along with him. The idea of a family resenting the widow of a lost loved one is also very old. **********Historians agree that the practice became widespread in the last 800 years after the beginning of brutal invasions by Moslem warriors. In this period, Rajasthan was a place of feudal warlords whose castles and forts still dot the rocky landscape. **********It was not uncommon then for entire families of menfolk to be wiped out in battle. Rather than submit or be swept off by conquerors, women killed themselves. Sati thus became associated with the upper feudal classes. **********Scholars say there are many recorded instances of women being drugged, tied to the burning pyre, held down by long poles or otherwise forced to commit sati - instances somewhat at variance with the romantic legend of self-sacrifice. Still, in Rajasthan the stories of mass suicides and immolations of thousands of women following great battles remain the stuff of legend and poetry. 'Drilled From Childhood' **********''In every Rajput family, it is something drilled into you from earliest childhood,'' said Sushil Kumari, a feminist who is a relative of the royal family of Jodhpur. ''Your husband is supposed to be a sort of godlike figure, and sati is the ultimate achievement for a girl. You're almost hypnotized into thinking this thing.'' **********Across Rajasthan are hundreds of shrines to satis, and festivals at these sites are common. Here in Deorala three such shrines commemorate immolations of 70 and 150 years ago. Villagers proudly said that a new shrine would be built soon. **********''You cannot say when a woman will feel this way,'' said Bhavar Singh Shekhawat, a 30-year-old Rajput landowner. ''People tried to prevent her, but she was very strong. She had faith. The people have come here to honor that faith.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/10/business/chip-indicator-is-again-lower.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 227, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chip Indicator Is Again Lower", "print_headline": "Chip Indicator Is Again Lower", "body_text": " **********The semiconductor industry's leading indicator fell for the fourth consecutive month, but shipments reached their highest point in three years for manufacturers based in the United States, Europe and Japan, a trade group reported today.

But its outlook is improving and it could increase Chrysler's share of the market by a few important percentage points. **********Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said in a statement, ''It'll strengthen both of us in what's already become a tough market.'' Modern Plant Involved **********The transaction would give Chrysler the highly profitable Jeep vehicles to broaden its model lineup, as well as A.M.C's modern assembly plant in Bramalea, Ontario, and 1,400 additional dealers. **********Chrysler announced that it had agreed to buy the 46 percent of American Motors held by Renault, the French Government-owned car company that bought into American Motors eight years ago. With that, automotive analysts said, the takeover is assured. Chrysler will also offer to buy up the remaining shares from the public. Little of the payment may be in cash. **********''It's a great deal for all three companies involved,'' said Jack V. Kirnan, an analyst with the Wall Street firm of Kidder, Peabody & Company. ''Jeep is a major prize.'' Remarkable Comeback **********The merger represents a milestone in the remarkable comeback by Chrysler, which was saved from bankruptcy with the assistance of Government-backed loans in the late 1970's. **********Since then, improved sales of a succession of new car models, including the popular mini-van, returned the company to prosperity and allowed it to repay the last of the Government-backed loans in 1983. Last year Chrysler earned $1.4 billion, while American Motors lost $91.3 million. **********With the merger of the two smallest of the four American-based auto manufacturers, Chrysler demonstrates a new confidence in reaching for a bigger presence in the car market. It also gets a continuing relationship with Renault, one of Europe's largest auto companies. **********Based on last year's results, the acquisition would raise Chrysler's share of the combined car and light-truck market in this country to 13.4 percent from 11.7 percent, although leaving it well behind the Ford Motor Company, which had 21.2 percent, and the General Motors Corporation at 38.5 percent. But Chrysler's share could be somewhat bigger than 13.4 percent if the expected improvement at American Motors is realized. **********In the financial community, analysts said that Chrysler would be gaining important assets, such as Jeep and the dealer network, at a modest price. **********Jeeps fetch as much at $20,000 for the top models, providing high profit margins. **********Jeep alone is worth more than $850 million, according to Ann C. Knight, an analyst with Paine Webber, the brokerage house. American Motors' new Ontario plant, which incorporates modern technology, is worth $650 million, she said. **********Other analysts have estimated that it would cost Chrysler about $1.2 billion to design competitors for Jeep and prepare a plant to produce the vehicles, which would still lack the well-known Jeep brand name. **********The announcement comes after months of conjecture that Chrysler, which is assembling one of its car lines at A.M.C.'s Kenosha, Wis., plant, would make an offer for the company, which endured heavy losses for years, causing a drain on Renault. **********Chrysler and American Motors have a long history of cooperation, and the ties between the two have grown closer in recent years. All Jeeps and other A.M.C. four-wheel-drive vehicles use gearboxes made by a Chrysler division, and last year the two companies agreed to assemble some of Chrysler's older rear-wheel-drive cars in the Kenosha plant. **********Renault, with financial problems of its own, had indicated a willingness in recent months to discuss a sale of A.M.C., but such talks were apparently disrupted by the assassination of Georges Besse, the head of Renault, in Paris last November. **********Bennett E. Bidwell, vice chairman of Chrysler, said today that ''any opportunity we had to do anything came to a grinding halt when Georges Besse was murdered.'' Mr. Besse's replacement, Raymond Levy, only recently resumed the discussions, Mr. Bidwell said. ''The deal came together this weekend, and we signed it this morning,'' he added. **********The United Automobile Workers called the merger ''a good match that potentially points the way to a more secure future for workers at both companies.'' The union, which had been in negotiations over work rule concessions at the Kenosha plant, said it would break off the talks for 30 days to allow the situation to clarify. **********Chrysler will give Renault $200 million in 10-year notes bearing 8 percent interest and other payments ranging from zero to $350 million based on A.M.C.'s future performance. In addition, Chrysler will assume $767 million of A.M.C.'s debt and will pay $35 million for a half interest in the American Motors Financial Corporation. **********Chrysler will also offer Chrysler stock valued at $4 for each American Motors share in public hands. Chrysler officials estimated that would be worth $522 million. **********American Motors stock closed at $4.25 a share, up 75 cents, in today's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The premium above the $4 offering price suggested to some analysts that Chrysler was in the market aggressively buying up stock, perhaps to give it a clear-cut majority when combined with the 46 percent Renault stake. **********Chrysler officials said they plan to complete the takeover in June. **********Analysts said Chrysler does not need all the plants A.M.C. operates, and they suggested that at least one of its four assembly plants would be sold or closed. **********Chrysler and American Motors have been discussing producing Chrysler's subcompact Omni and Horizon models at Kenosha, which has been underutilized because of the collapse in demand for A.M.C's own subcompact car, the Alliance. However, those talks have been held up by Chrysler's insistence that it has to cut labor costs if it is to make such low-priced models profitably. **********Mr. Bidwell said today that the company would probably have to decide whether to make the cars at Kenosha before taking over American Motors. The Belvidere, Ill., plant was shut recently for conversion to production of a higher-profit car. **********Chrysler has tried to keep its costs under control since escaping from the specter of bankruptcy. But two of A.M.C.'s assembly plants - the Kenosha facility and the Jeep plant in Toledo - date from the turn of the century and have a history of high costs and poor labor relations. **********The Standard & Poor's Corporation said that it was studying Chrysler's credit standing and that a downgrade in ratings was likely as a result of the implications of the A.M.C. acquisition. Including unfunded pension obligations and legal contingencies, largely as a result of rollover accidents in Jeeps, Chrysler is paying a total of $2 billion for American Motors, the rating company said. **********Mr. Iacocca said Chrysler would continue to distribute Renault cars in North America through the A.M.C. dealer network and would work with the French company to develop new products. **********American Motors recently introduced a compact sedan from Renault, the Medallion. It has also planned to introduce a mid-size car, the Premier. Company officials had said this broader product line would give it better prospects for profitability.

Last November, the company shook Wall Street by abandoning friendly talks to buy a Sun Chemical division and making a bid for all of Sun Chemical. It eventually dropped its bid for Sun when the company agreed to sell Dainippon the division. Dainippon then surprised chemical executives by paying $550 million for the division, far more than others might have paid. **********With professionals speculating that something similar might happen to Reichhold, its stock jumped $18.25, to $60.50, on June 25, when the offer was made. Yesterday, the shares closed at $63.125, ahead $2.375 - nearly $11 higher than Dainippon's initial offer. **********Reichhold said its board had rejected the offer as inadequate. It said it had instructed its adviser, the First Boston Corporation, to explore inquiries and develop ''all superior alternatives.'' **********In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reichhold said it was considering the sale of all or part of the company, a management buyout or other steps, including litigation. It said it had been approached by several American and foreign companies, which it declined to name. **********C. Robert Powell, chairman, said the directors were ''profoundly disappointed'' with what he assailed as ''the manner in which Dainippon approached their discussions with us and their launching of a surprise offer at a ludicrous price in the midst of our talks.'' Insiders said that Mr. Powell had been trying to get Dainippon to pay at least $70 a share. **********Mr. Powell said Reichhold's directors had also decided not to change the anti-takeover defenses that make it expensive to acquire the company. **********The hostile bid was disclosed in a Japanese newspaper, angering Reichhold. The company said that Mr. Powell had called Shigekuni Kawamura, president of Dainippon, to say he was ''upset'' by the report, and that Mr. Kawamura replied that he was also upset and that the account was inaccurate. **********Reichhold then asked the Japanese executive to issue a denial before the stock market opened. Reichhold said Mr. Kawamura had responded that, while he was surprised by the article, he could not say that all of it was false."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/01/world/comrades-terror-soldiers-thugs-are-reportedly-allied-campaign-haiti-cancel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Comrades in Terror; Soldiers and Thugs Are Reportedly Allied In the Campaign in Haiti to Cancel Election", "print_headline": "Comrades in Terror; Soldiers and Thugs Are Reportedly Allied In the Campaign in Haiti to Cancel Election", "body_text": " **********The violent disruption of Haiti's elections Sunday seemed to destroy a notion that some mysterious, uncontrollable force had been wreaking violence on the land. **********In several attacks on polling places Sunday, the shooting was done not only by the usual thugs in civilian clothing but also reportedly by uniformed soldiers of the provisional Government. **********Finally, after months of killing and terror attacks by unidentified gunmen, there was evidence that these people were working in concert with the armed forces, the institution that the United States had counted on to bring Haiti to democracy. **********Today, as residents of the capital began a timid return to a normal life, stunned survivors and curious onlookers caused a small traffic jam at a school that was the scene of the worst atrocity.  [ Page A15. ]  Their timidity was understandable. Robert E. White, the former United States Ambassador in El Salvador, said that as an observer of the disrupted elections, he witnessed soldiers cooperating with civilian thugs and was told by a clergyman about an attack carried out by soldiers. There were many similar reports. **********''It seems clear to me,'' Mr. White said, ''that there is a reciprocal relationship between the military and the Macoutes.'' **********Macoutes is short for the Tontons Macoute, a collection of killers, torturers and extortionists that Francois Duvalier, the founder of the family dictatorship, created shortly after his fraudulent election to the presidency in 1957. In the early days, they affected a sinister look with dark sunglasses and fedoras. Officers Reported Angered **********Francois Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude used the Tontons Macoute as enforcers and as a counterweight to the army, which had brought the elder Mr. Duvalier to power. But the Tontons Macoute were also used to carry out onerous, extralegal tasks that even in bloodstained Haiti were considered potentially damaging to the reputation of the armed forces. **********Some Haitians say that many of these former Tontons Macoute have become members of a paramilitary force, available for hire when needed. Some Haitians say some army officers were angered when soldiers and Ma-coutes were seen working together on Election Day. They blame Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy, the head of the provisional Government, for having damaged the army's reputation and have reportedly been discussing trying to push him aside. Though these officers appear opposed to General Namphy, Haitians say they are by no means in favor of entirely democratic elections. **********From the time of the collapse of Jean-Claude Duvalier's dictatorship 22 months ago and General Namphy's emergence as the provisional Government's head, the general had been saying that his main goal is to turn over power to an elected civilian government. The United States and other major donors of aid to Haiti believed the general. As violence grew before the elections, some diplomats said it appeared that it was being carried out by people beyond his control. Army Is Accused **********But after watching the attacks Sunday, a diplomat said that the election violence was ''obviously aided and abetted by the Haitian Army.'' **********In an early public act as head of government, General Namphy, who is 53 years old and who rose to Chief of Staff under Jean-Claude Duvalier, disbanded the Tontons Macoute. But he did not disarm most of them. **********Not surprisingly, no one has publicly admitted being a member of a paramilitary force, and the structure and control of the force as well as who pays its members remains unclear. But it is these people who are generally referred to as Macoute who are believed to be responsible for the continuing terror. **********Even though the opponents of elections accomplished their objective, they are continuing their intimidation, presumably in hopes of suppressing a reaction from the millions of Haitians who were hoping for a chance to fairly choose their next leader. There were few people in the streets in the heart of the capital today, and as night fell scattered shooting was heard. There was a report that a man had been shot to death on a main avenue a few blocks from the presidential palace. **********The final drive to disrupt what was to have been Haiti's first presidential election in 30 years started in early-morning darkness Sunday with arson fires and attacks with hand grenades and gunfire. Soldiers Are Seen Firing **********In the capital, most of the shooting appeared to have been done by men in civilian clothes. But soldiers were seen firing into a few voting places and before the polls opened, 16 of them destroyed the transmitter for the widely heard Roman Catholic radio station in Haiti, according to a priest. **********In the town of Gonaives, to the north of Port-au-Prince, soldiers stole ballots and ballot boxes and fired into the air to scare away voters, witnesses said. Voters also ran out of voting places in the town of Les Cayes, to the south, as soldiers fired in the air. **********The term Macoute has taken on a broader meaning these days and is being applied to all of those in the minority who have been trying to block democracy with the hope of preserving as much as possible of the social structure created by Francois Duvalier. Duvalier Loyalists **********These people are also often referred to as Duvalier loyalists. They benefited from a system of privileges, but many of them despised the younger Duvalier do not want to see him make a comeback. **********Although General Namphy rose to high office under the Duvaliers, he is remembered as having somehow remained independent and uncorrupted. But ''he was obviously a Duvalierist,'' said a foreigner who has known him for years. **********General Namphy has been the most visible member of the provisional Government, but the other soldier in government, Maj. Gen. Williams Regala, 49 years old, has been more often in touch with United States officials and has made several trips to Washington. **********In the early days of the provisional Government, some Haitians accused General Regala of having been present at a massacre of civilians in the southern town of Jeremie, and there were repeated calls for him to step down. He surprised Haitians by responding to the charges in interviews with newspapers and radio stations, and though he spoke in generalities the calls for his resignation faded. **********General Namphy said Sunday that he remained committed to holding elections in time to have a civilian inaugurated as President next February. He disbanded the civilian council that organized the elections, and some Government officials say they think it is unlikely that civic and political groups will be willing to nominate replacements for the original members. **********''General Namphy wants to have elections,'' a businessman said. ''But he wants to control them so he can make sure that the next President does not cause problems for the army.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/business/for-small-planes-more-buyers-think-brazil.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1987-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1745, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Small Planes, More Buyers Think Brazil", "print_headline": "For Small Planes, More Buyers Think Brazil", "body_text": " **********IN a cavernous hangar at the headquarters of Embraer, as the Brazilian Aerospace Corporation is known, work has begun on the first of 20 twin-prop Brasilia aircraft on order from Texas Air. Near the plant's runway, technicians are testing five single-engine Tucano trainer planes, with the colors of the Peruvian Air Force. In another building, preparations are going ahead for construction of the external flaps for McDonnell Douglas's new MD-11 tri-jet. **********Founded here 18 years ago, Embraer has grown into the largest aircraft manufacturer in the third world. It routinely finds buyers for its small-sized military and civilian planes in the competitive markets of the United States, Britain, France and West Germany. And soon its first jet fighter, the subsonic AMX, which it is building in partnership with Italy's Aermacchi and Aeritalia companies, will be ready for marketing. **********It was not easy for Embraer to nudge its way into the highly competitive market of civil aviation. Who, after all, would want to fly in Brazilian planes when similar aircraft from, say, the United States, Canada or the Netherlands were available? **********''That used to worry us too,'' said Ozilio Carlos da Silva, Embraer's managing director. ''But it's a process. You sell first in your own market, then you become known in air industry literature, then you start going to air shows. I remember the first time Lord Waterpark saw a Bandeirante at the Farnborough Air Show in 1977. He liked it, flew in it and then wanted to sell it.'' Lord Waterpark became Embraer's agent in Britain and has sold 30 Bandeirantes there. **********The twin-engine, 19-seat Bandeirante, popular with commuter airlines, was Embraer's first major success abroad. But it was the Tucano that first won it prestige, beating out the much-vaunted Swiss-made Pilatus PC-9 trainer for a major contract with the Royal Air Force two years ago. Short Brothers of Belfast is building 131 of the Tucanos under contract, while another 120 are being assembled from kits at a plant near Cairo for the Egyptian and Iraqi air forces. Production here is also going full blast, with a total of 592 orders or options for the $1.4 million Tucano. **********None of this would seem unusual, however, were Embraer not in a country caught in its worst economic crisis in decades, one that has a suffocatingly large bureaucracy that loves to meddle. Brazil also has a huge foreign debt, social problems that defy solution and a government that many analysts say is without direction. In this context, Embraer's feat can only be explained as yet another of the contradictions that have long defined this vast nation. **********EMBRAER is not in fact the only state company in Brazil that is well run: the mining giant, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, and the oil corporation, Petrobras, are also efficient. Nor is Embraer the only Brazilian company to outsell established multinationals in some developing countries: The military hardware manufacturers, Engesa and Avibras, which also have their headquarters in this city 60 miles north of Sao Paulo, do pretty well too. **********Yet Embraer stands out because it neither deals in raw materials nor targets its goods for the third world. Rather, with a self-confidence verging on arrogance, it tried from the beginning to sell high-technology products to industrialized nations. It learned to identify a need, develop a product and market it successfully. In the process, it even became modestly profitable. **********So far, it has made more than 3,500 aircraft of 15 different models. Some, such as the Xavante jet fighter and several Piper models, were simply assembled here. But three planes have marked Embraer's technological advance: the Bandeirante, some 465 of which have been sold in 35 countries, with 147 still being flown in the United States alone; the two-seater Tucano pilot trainer, which is being flown by eight air forces, and the new 30-seat Brasilia, which several United States commuter airlines are already using. This year, Embraer's revenue should exceed $600 million, two-thirds of it from exports. **********That Brazil should build its own aircraft industry is in itself not surprising. The country is so large and many of its regions so inaccessible that efficient air transport is a necessity. The military regime that ruled Brazil between 1964 and 1985 also felt that an independent aircraft industry was essential to security. When businessmen were skeptical about the project's viability, the Air Force used its own money to found Embraer. **********Its good fortune was that a team of engineers and technicians had been working at the Air Force's prestigious Aerospace Technical Center here and had already developed the prototype for the Bandeirante. This team took over Embraer under the leadership of Col. Ozires Silva, 56 years old, a charismatic engineer who came to personify the company's pioneering spirit. Last year, he was named to run Petrobras, no small recognition of his talents, but he remained chairman of Embraer while Mr. da Silva, his assistant, who is 50, took over as managing director. **********''The original team still runs the company,'' Mr. da Silva said in a recent interview. ''There were 150 of us at the beginning, all with the same background and the same objectives.'' The team proved to be both technically competent and creative, which meant that Embraer conceived products that were not only efficient but also competitive. ''Now we have 11,000 employees,'' Mr. da Silva continued, ''but the same esprit de corps infects them.'' **********One rule established early was that Embraer should be run with the discipline of a private company, even though it depended on the Government to replenish its capital. Thus, while many other state-run companies routinely provided sinecures for retired military officers and friendly politicians, the Air Force insured that jobs in Embraer were not traded for favors. ''I think the complexity of our operation moderated the appetite for meddling,'' Mr. da Silva said. **********AS a relatively small company, Embraer still lacks the capacity to develop more than one major product at the same time. Once the Tucano was on the assembly line, though, the company began concentrating on the Brasilia, which now stands at the center of its marketing effort. Its sales team, working out of its subsidiary company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., has already taken orders and options for 179 Brasilias in the United States, 33 of which are already flying for five small airlines. One sign that Embraer is now fully focused abroad is that only 15 orders and options for the Brasilia are from Brazilian airlines, out of a total of 257. **********The company's next two projects are joint ventures. The AMX jet fighter has given Embraer access to advanced technology obtained from Italy and the company will benefit particularly from Aermacchi's participation in the construction of the European Tornado fighter. But Embraer has no plans to graduate on its own to supersonic fighters. ''We simply don't have the financial resources,'' Mr. da Silva said. ''The Brazilian Air Force could not come up with the development costs.'' **********Cost is also the reason that Embraer has brought in the Argentine Factory for Aerospace Material, called FAMA, as a one-third partner in its next civil aviation project. The 19-seat CBA-123, which will cost $300 million to develop, will use the cockpit and fuselage of the Brasilia and have twin-prop ''pusher'' engines mounted in the rear. Plans to elongate either the CBA-123 or the Brasilia to carry 40 passengers are being discussed, Mr. da Silva said, ''to keep us in the market until 2010.'' But he added: ''We can't go into big passenger planes. It's too expensive and the market is too small. We have to look for other areas of the market.'' **********Embraer may have found one of those areas with its successful bid for the $120 million contract to build composite material flaps for the MD-11. In partnership with Engesa, a manufacturer of tanks and other armored vehicles, Embraer also recently formed a new company, Orbita S.A., to build military missiles and space rockets. The new unit will draw upon technology developed by the Aerospace Technical Center, which acts as the main research body for much of the industry. **********EXPANSION is forcing Embraer to look for new sources of capital. In the past, the company financed operations through sporadic capital infusions by the Government, by reinvesting profits and by benefiting from a plan by which private companies could spend 1 percent of their corporate tax on non-voting shares in Embraer. ''In the 1970's, this was sufficient, but it is not in the 1980's,'' Mr. da Silva said. **********With a third of current income assigned to servicing the company's $95 million foreign debt and accompanying domestic debts, Embraer is negotiating a payment rescheduling with the Government's National Bank for Economic and Social Development. ''Since the debt crisis, we can't borrow abroad for longer than 360 days,'' the official went on. ''If we can switch from short-term to long-term debt, our profitability will improve.'' **********In reality, while the company has had only one unprofitable year (in 1985, when it lost $4.8 million), reinvestment has always taken precedence over profits, which reached a modest $10 million last year on sales of $378 million. This emphasis must change since Embraer hopes to finance development of the CBA-123 on the stock market. ''No one will buy our shares unless we're efficient and profitable,'' Mr. da Silva said. ''You can't be efficient in your technology and marketing and inefficient in your financing and still hope to survive.'' One fashionable solution that is apparently not being debated here, however, is that Embraer should be privatized. Brazilian businessmen, who in 1969 refused to invest in the company, would now be attracted by the idea, but the Government is not selling. The Air Force still sees Embraer as a strategic asset that, in an emergency, can produce the military hardware it needs. But there is also a touch of pride in its jealous hold on the company. ''After all,'' Mr. da Silva said, ''we did it alone.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/16/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** Michael D.

The reduction program is part of a plan to reduce the 188,000-member work force of Pratt & Whitney's parent company, the United Technologies Corporation, by 11,000 jobs during 1987."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/07/business/state-savings-banks-thriving.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1987-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1909, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STATE SAVINGS BANKS THRIVING", "print_headline": "STATE SAVINGS BANKS THRIVING", "body_text": " **********Like the city itself, which went from the precipice of bankruptcy in the 1970's to prosperity, New York's savings banks are back. **********When interest rates passed 20 percent in the early 1980's, savings banks suffered so badly that regulators thought the entire industry might crumble. The banks' capital was virtually wiped out by gaping losses as they were caught between having made long-term, fixed-rate loans at low rates and having to pay higher rates for deposits. The institutions could not even be sold, so serious was their plight. Now, thanks to lower interest rates, balance-sheet restructuring, diversification and a removal of usury ceilings, the savings banks are again prospering. **********''We're not only seeing the light at the end of the tunnel; we're out of the tunnel,'' said John T. Morgan, chief executive of the American Savings Bank. ''It's whoopy time.'' Return to Profitability **********Profits have clearly recovered. After losing hundreds of millions of dollars in each of the preceding five years, the New York savings banks returned to profitability in 1985, earning $573.8 million, for a return on assets of 0.81 percent. In the first six months of 1986 alone, the savings banks exceeded this profit level, earning $800.7 million, for a healthy 1.09 percent return on assets. **********As a result, savings banks have become some of the hottest properties around. In the last six weeks, two of New York's oldest savings banks -the Emigrant and the Williamsburgh - have been sold. In the last 15 months, ownership has changed at five other big New York State savings bank: the Bowery, Dollar Dry Dock, East River, Seamen's and the Savings Bank of Rockland County. The sale of the seven institutions has led to a change in control of $20 billion out of the $120 billion of New York savings-bank deposits. **********Besides demonstrating how much savings banks' prospects have brightened, the quicker pace of sales has tantalized other prospective buyers. Indeed, industry experts say that it is only a matter of time before another big local savings bank goes on the block. **********''Ever since the Emigrant deal was announced, the phones have been ringing a lot,'' said Edward T. Lutz, regional director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which receives bids on savings banks and manages their sale. ''Other similar deals are being worked on.'' Some Criticism of Sales **********While the selling over all is being viewed positively by regulators - to the extent that buyers inject capital, they help insure the banks' survival and thereby improve competition -the trend has not been without critics. **********Some people fear, for example, that the new owners will not run the savings banks according to their historical mandate: to provide banking services to the working class. They worry that the savings banks will either be broken up or that they will pursue other ventures to the neglect of their lending for home mortgages. **********''To have some developers - a couple of local painters and plumbers -buy up a thrift? That's crazy!'' said Isidore J. Lasurdo, chairman and chief executive of the Green Point Savings Bank of Brooklyn, alluding to local real estate developers who have led the buying spree. **********Others complain that the savings banks are being sold too cheaply. They charge that the F.D.I.C., worried about its own liability if a bank fails, is taking any bid that appears for the institutions. Mr. Lutz of the F.D.I.C. rejects these charges as baseless, but even those who support the F.D.I.C.'s efforts believe that the agency may suffer from a conflict. **********''Obviously, the F.D.I.C. has a self-interest in seeing these deals go through,'' said Howard C. St. John, chairman and president of the Ulster Savings Bank of Kingston, N.Y. Savings Banks' Traditonal Roles **********A bigger fear, of course, is that the savings banks will abandon their traditional roles as neighborhood-oriented housing lenders. While that has not happened, changes have been made. For example, the president of the Seamen's Bank for Savings, Steven H. Rice, quit after executives from the Lomas & Nettleton Company acquired Seamen's in December 1985. **********Richard Ravitch, former chief of the Metropolitan Transit Authority who with other individuals acquired the Bowery Savings Bank in October 1985, brought in an entirely new management team and has since steered the savings bank into the mortgage servicing business, consumer banking and commercial lending, although it continues to make a large number of home loans. **********The sales of the seven New York savings banks are fundamentally different from the so-called thrift conversions that have become all the rage in the savings industry. **********In a thrift conversion, such as the huge conversion recently by the Dime Savings Bank of New York, a savings bank goes public by converting from mutual ownership, in which a bank is owned jointly by depositors, to stock ownership. In cases like the Dime, the shares have been sold to thousands of individual investors, none having a sufficient number to control. 'Change-of-Control Conversions' **********In sales that have been approved by the F.D.I.C. in the last 15 months, by contrast, the institutions have been converted to stock form and the new owner has been either a single individual, one corporation or a small group of well-heeled investors. The Williamsburgh, for example, was sold to a corporation, the Republic National Bank of New York. The other six significant sales in New York have been to small groups of individuals. Such transactions are being called ''change-of-control conversions.'' **********And while each sale has its own twist in terms of financial structure, they all reflect essentially the same economic forces, industry experts say. For the savings banks, the motivation to sell has been a desire to rebuild capital. The savings banks' new owners came to the negotiating table with fat bankbooks and have subsequently injected their institutions with needed cash. **********''Even though we had turned the corner and were profitable, it would have taken us a lot longer to reach our regulatory required capital through earnings,'' said Raymond V. O'Brien Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Emigrant Savings Bank. ''Second, there was the question of whether interest rates might go up again in the future.'' **********For the buyers of the savings banks, the advantage in making substantial equity investments - hundreds of millions of dollars, in some cases - is that they gain control over billions of dollars in loans and other assets, as well as a loyal deposit base. **********''We believed back then - and we believe now - that you can earn a decent return on investment in retail banking in New York City,'' said Mr. Ravitch of the Bowery. Low-Interest-Rate Environment **********In the current environment of low interest rates, savings banks' assets can be far more profitable than in the past, the new owners believe. **********''We view the savings bank as a better investment opportunity than the other things we're looking at,'' said Seymour Milstein, the New York real estate developer who acquired the Emigrant. **********Buyers often intend either to sell the savings bank later to another individual at a higher price or to take the institution public. Other buyers may choose to hold onto their new properties, using their substantial cash flows to bankroll other ventures. **********''It's no different from investing in G.M.,'' said Michael M. Horn, a senior vice president at the Wall Street firm Ryan, Beck & Company. ''These guys feel that if they put X million in, over time the business will grow and their investment will increase in value.'' Savings Banks' Earlier Woes **********Savings banks got in trouble when interest rates rose. Many of their home mortgage assets had maturities of 30 years, but their deposits were short-term. Banks soon found themselves paying steadily increasing interest on deposits while the income from loans remained relatively steady. **********For now, at least, the trends affecting the savings industry are positive. In California, big thrift institutions such as Home Savings and Golden West Financial are shaming big banks, producing double-digit increases in earnings and returns on equity of 25 percent or greater. **********It turns out, moreover, that the same economic forces that have made California thrift units so successful have been increasing returns at New York savings banks - and go far toward explaining the local banks' new allure. Thrift units on both coasts have led the way in issuing variable-rate mortgages, instruments that help shield home lenders from interest-rate risk. And, unlike savings institutions in the heart of the country, the thrift units in New York and California have not been adversely affected by a portfolio of bad mortgages. **********On the contrary, the default rate in New York is among the lowest anywhere. Now that rates have fallen, the banks have sold off their old, low-paying home mortgages with little or no loss. The lower rates have also reduced the interest paid on deposits. With usury ceilings gone, the banks are free to charge what they wish on loans. And diversification efforts should help to stabilize earnings. **********Industry data bear this out. According to the Savings Bank Association of New York State, the industry's ratio of net worth to assets peaked at 6.8 percent in 1979. By 1981, with interest rates rising rapidly, the ratio had fallen to 4.9 percent. It bottomed out at 3.6 percent in 1984 and has since recovered to 5.7 percent. **********Not everyone, however, sees a happy ending. ''All interest rates have to do is rise a percentage point or two, and these savings banks will be back in the proverbial tank,'' said Mr. Lasurdo of Greenpoint Savings.

Yet ''every year, if not every day, we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy,'' he said. And prophecies don't always come true. **********Currently the great American economic prophecy is that the huge trade deficit, which began to shrink last fall, will continue a slow decline and someday, in the 1990's, will disappear. **********The only thing the nation has to do, according to this prophecy, is to stick to its present economic course. The dollar must stay down, manufacturing productivity has to go on growing at nearly 4 percent annually and the lid has to remain on wages -to dampen the demand for imports. The Europeans and Japanese also have to do their part, of course, becoming the front-line consumers of America's growing industrial output. **********Viewed from this perspective, there was a lot of shoulder-shrugging among economists Wednesday when the Commerce Department announced that the trade deficit had widened in May. The increase was interpreted as an aberration. ''I think we will continue to get a significant and substantial improvement in the deficit,'' said Robert Z. Lawrence, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. But he had an important caveat. ''There is a distinction,'' Mr. Lawrence said, ''between getting the trade deficit down and eliminating it.'' **********That is the great concern - the unknown in the prophecy. Many economists agree that $60 billion or $70 billion can be skimmed off last year's trade deficit of $144.3 billion, largely because of the 50 percent decline in the value of the dollar since 1985. The fear is that the remaining $70 billion to $80 billion will turn out to be rooted in the economy and will be an endless drain on the American standard of living. That is because the trade deficit is, in effect, a foreign debt that already costs the nation billions of dollars a year in interest payments. **********The process of shrinking the trade gap began in last year's fourth quarter. Since then, the deficit has shrunk from $47.9 billion, to $40.9 billion in this year's first quarter, as measured in constant 1982 dollars. That fixed yardstick discloses true trade volume by eliminating from the Commerce Department's monthly figures the impact of inflation and the distortions that have resulted from the dollar's devaluation. **********The decline, if it continued into the second quarter - and it very probably did - means the 1987 trade deficit could come in at $163.6 billion, or well below last year's $175.9 billion. In nominal dollars, the shrinkage would be to $127 billion from $144.3 billion. The improvement is cited by the Reagan Administration as evidence that the dollar is already low enough to eventually close the trade gap. **********But more than half the improvement has come from importing less oil, and now oil imports have begun to rise. Over the long term, the key to closing the trade gap lies not in oil and other commodities but in regaining the American advantage in manufacturing, particularly in selling more capital goods, autos, industrial supplies and consumer products abroad, and importing less of each category. Over the last nine months, only industrial supplies - such as textiles, paper and chemicals -have shown much improvement. **********Why is manufacturing so intractable? One view is that other nations have been too successful in overcoming the technology gap and much more must be spent on research to regain lost ground. ''People expect a trade improvement because the dollar has depreciated, but that is not going to be enough with so much high-tech slippage,'' said Kenneth Flamm of the Brookings Institution. **********Without a technology edge, an alternative is to increase manufacturing productivity at perhaps twice the current clip, says Charles H. Ferguson, a research associate for the Center for Technology, Policy and Industrial Development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********Another approach is more devaluation. In the 1970's the United States made up for the rising proficiency in technology abroad by allowing the dollar to erode at an average annual rate of 2 percent to 3 percent a year, according to Paul R. Krugman, an M.I.T. economics professor who recently published a study on the subject. The sharp rise in the dollar in the early 1980's interrupted this process, and the devaluation since 1985 has only now brought the dollar back to the 1980 level. **********The dollar will probably have to fall to between 110 and 120 yen to offset foreign gains in productivity and technology since 1980, Mr. Krugman said. He is not alone in advocating another round of devaluation - one that would bring the dollar below 120 yen and below 1.50 marks - if the trade deficit is to eventually move toward zero. The current levels are above 148 yen and 1.82 marks. **********''I have talked to a lot of corporations in the past week, and no one disagrees that we need considerably more on the dollar,'' said Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. **********Given the mild economic growth in Europe and Japan, which are counted on to purchase American exports, ''you really need a dollar at 120 yen, minimum, by the end of next year,'' he said, adding that maybe the devaluation should come quickly for maximum effect. **********Devaluation, of course, is a fallback solution. Cut the dollar by enough, say by half, and even the last $60 billion of the trade deficit will disappear quickly as everyone rushes to buy American goods at very low prices in foreign currencies. **********But such a devaluation would drastically reduce American purchasing power and living standards. The trick to eliminating the trade deficit painlessly appears to be some higher level of productivity and some lower level for the dollar."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/25/business/what-s-new-in-hotel-safety-detectors-that-talk-to-the-front-desk.html": {"writer_name": "Kendall Wills", "pub_date": "1987-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 561, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Detectors That Talk to the Front Desk", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN HOTEL SAFETY; Detectors That Talk to the Front Desk", "body_text": " **********RESEARCH on smoke detectors, as with most fire safety research, has focused on the issue of speeding up the warning time, giving guests a chance to get out and firefighters a chance to get in before dense smoke and toxic gases make approaching the fire hazardous or even impossible. **********''The biggest weakness in smoke detection is that nobody is in the hotel room when the fire starts,'' said Larry Chervenak, president of the consulting firm, Chervenak, Keane & Company. ''The cleaning staff may be down the hall and a fire can cause a whole lot of havoc before anyone knows about it.'' **********But last week, the National Fire Protection Association, which sets standards that are adopted by many states and by organizations that test safety equipment, issued a temporary standard for wireless smoke detectors, clearing the way for the commercial adoption of the new technology. The wireless smoke detector - now used in only five hotels and manufactured by World Electronics, of Coral Springs, Fla. - is capable of sending a signal to the hotel's front desk the second the detector alarm is triggered. **********Even in a high-rise building, employees manning the front desk could pinpoint the floor and room in which a fire started. They could then sound a general alarm, alert the local fire department and begin an evacuation of the hotel's guests, if that seems necessary. Firefighters could monitor the spread of the fire as signals continued to be sent to the front desk. **********''I know of a lot of hotel organizations that were looking at it and were waiting for the N.F.P.A. ruling,'' said Mr. Chervenak. ''It's on the leading edge of technology.'' **********Mr. Barrett said that the wireless smoke detectors work like cellular telephones. The signals are transmitted on a frequency that is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. It is less costly, by up to 75 percent, according to the company's estimate, than the smoke-detector systems that require hard wiring. And it promises to be less disruptive during installment in existing buildings, he added. **********The system is also potentially more flexible than existing smoke detectors, once a fire is discovered. Fire department officials can direct firefighting operations from the front desk, alerting the firefighters about smoke-filled stairwells or rapidly spreading fires. **********Despite their manifest advantages, wireless smoke detectors do suffer one drawback. With an installation cost of about $250 a room, they are considerably more expensive than the typical, battery-powered smoke detectors, which might run as much as $25 each. **********World Technologies is a private company with 11 employees and sales last year of about $2.5 million, 70 percent of which came from the sale of its fire safety systems, Mr. Barrett said. With the N.F.P.A. standards rating, Mr. Barrett said he expected sales to nearly double in the next year. ''So many buildings were built before the new fire codes that there is now a drastic need to go back and equip these buildings with smoke detectors,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/07/business/comsat-s-merger-called-off.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1987-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMSAT'S MERGER CALLED OFF", "print_headline": "COMSAT'S MERGER CALLED OFF", "body_text": " **********The Contel Corporation and Comsat yesterday broke off their proposed $2.4 billion merger. **********Instead, Contel will acquire two of the faltering businesses of Comsat -its international private line operations and its VSAT technology, which involves small earth stations that are efficient in transmitting data.

Other F.C.C. proposals would decrease the amount of overseas traffic transmitted on Comsat's international networks and increase the use of fiber optics over satellites in trans-Atlantic communications. **********Contel said the actions would hurt Comsat financially and would not have been resolved by the time the merger would have been completed. **********Analysts said that ending the merger was good for both companies.

That appeal is now headed for the Texas Supreme Court. Appeal Not Affected **********Today's decision does not directly affect the appeal but will greatly increase pressure on Texaco to settle the complex suit, and could push Texaco toward bankruptcy proceedings. **********A Texas jury awarded Pennzoil $10.53 billion in November 1985, finding that Texaco illegally interfered with a merger contract between Pennzoil and the Getty Oil Company in early 1984, when Texaco bought Getty for $10.1 billion. A Texas appellate court upheld all but $2 billion of the award on Feb. 12 of this year. Last week Texaco asked the appellate court to rehear the case. **********Texaco's stock fell on the news of the Supreme Court's ruling, dropping $4 a share, to $33.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. Pennzoil soared $6.875, to $88.50.

[ Page D21. ]  The case has involved the highest stakes, some of the highest-priced legal talent and one of the more unusual procedural maneuvers in American legal history. **********Today's decision grew out of a sepa-rate suit filed by Texaco in the Federal District Court in White Plains, near its headquarters, to block enforcement of the appeal bond requirement and to prevent Pennzoil from placing liens on its assets, so that Texaco could remain intact while its appeal was pending in the Texas courts. **********Although the Supreme Court ruled by 9 to 0 to dismiss Texaco's Federal suit, different Justices gave conflicting reasons. Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. held for himself and four others that the lower Federal courts should have ''abstained'' rather than making what he called ''their unprecedented intrusion into the Texas judicial system.'' **********The decision means that Texas courts will now decide whether Texaco should be relieved from the state appeal bond law, which would ordinarily allow Pennzoil immediately to place liens on and execute its judgment against Texaco assets in the state unless Texaco can post an appeal bond of more than $10 billion. Texaco has said that it could not obtain such a large bond. Bankruptcy Filing Possible **********As a practical matter, if Texaco cannot win relief from the appeal bond requirement in the Texas courts, or in a possible future appeal to the Supreme Court on that issue, it could be forced into bankruptcy proceedings while its appeal of the $10 billion damage award is pending. **********James W. Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive officer, said today, ''If these efforts in the courts and in discussions with Pennzoil fail to provide Texaco with the reasonable relief it requires to continue its appeal on the merits of the case, Texaco would have no alternative but to seek protection of its stockholders under Chapter 11'' of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. **********But he said Texaco still hoped ''to rectify the gross miscarriage of justice that has occurred to this point.'' **********Joseph D. Jamail, Pennzoil's chief attorney in Texas, said in an interview today that, if Texaco would make a ''fair'' proposal for encumbering enough assets in one way or another to secure the total amount of Pennzoil's judgment, he would not insist on a $10 billion appeal bond or seek to execute the judgment or place liens against Texaco while the direct appeal is pending. In a statement issued tonight, Pennzoil said it was amenable to alternative security arrangements. **********Mr. Jamail added that ''for the management of Texaco to even attempt to declare bankruptcy is a totally irresponsible act to cover themselves from the stockholder suits that have been filed against them.'' **********Justice Powell stressed that the majority ruling did not involve the legality of the state court's award of damages against Texaco or the constitutionality of the state's appeal bond law. Rather, he said, the Court ruled only that the lower Federal courts should not have intervened in the case out of respect for the Texas judiciary, which he said was capable of hearing Texaco's challenge to the constitutionality of the state appeal bond requirement. Federalism Principles Cited **********He said Texaco should have sought relief from the appeal bond requirement from the Texas courts, not from Federal courts, which he said ''should have abstained under the principles of Federalism enunciated in Younger v. Harris,'' a 1971 decision barring lower Federal courts from interfering in continuing state criminal prosecutions. **********Justice Powell rejected Texaco's argument that it would have been futile to seek relief from the appeal bond requirement in the Texas courts. While noting the possibility that Texaco may no longer have a right under Texas procedural law to seek relief from the appeal bond requirements in Texas courts, Justice Powell said that was for the Texas courts to resolve. **********''If, and when, the Texas courts render a final decision on any Federal issue presented by this litigation, review may be sought in this Court in the customary manner,'' he added. **********Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia joined Justice Powell's opinion. Three Separate Opinions **********Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens disagreed strongly with Justice Powell's holding that the lower Federal courts should have abstained from hearing the case but concurred on other grounds, in three separate opinions. **********They agreed that ''Texaco's claim that the Texas bond and lien provisions violate the 14th Amendment is without merit,'' and that Texaco's right to a meaningful appeal ''can be adequately vindicated even if Texaco were forced to file for bankruptcy,'' as Justice Brennan put it. **********Justice Marshall noted in a separate opinion that ''the sole proprietor of a small Texas grocery'' would have gotten nowhere asking a Federal court in New York to intervene in a hypothetical $10,000 lawsuit in Texas. ''The principles which would have governed with $10,000 at stake should also govern when thousands have become billions,'' he said. ''That is the essence of equal justice under law.'' **********Justice Harry A. Blackmun rejected the reasoning of Justice Powell and Justice Brennan alike while concurring on other grounds in the decision, Pennzoil v. Texaco, No. 85-1798. **********Texaco has suggested in the past that it cannot get a fair hearing against Houston-based Pennzoil in state courts in Texas. **********The Texas jury's $10.53 billion award against Texaco on Nov. 19, 1985, by far the largest award of damages in history, was for what the jury found to be Texaco's illegal interference with Pennzoil's plans to acquire three-sevenths of Getty in early 1984. **********It included $7.53 billion in compensatory damages, based on Pennzoil's estimate of what it would cost to drill as much oil as it would have obtained in the deal with Getty, and $3 million in punitive damages. **********Facing what it called imminent bankruptcy because of the Texas law's apparent requirement that it post an appeal bond in the entire amount of the judgment, Texaco filed its highly unusual suit in the Federal District Court in White Plains on Dec. 10, 1985, seeking relief from the appeal bond requirement while it pursued its appeal of the damage award in the Texas courts. **********On Jan. 10, 1986, Federal District Judge Charles L. Brieant held it would violate due process of law to enforce the Texas bond requirement against Texaco, barred Pennzoil from attaching liens to Texaco property while the Texas appeal was pending and attacked the fairness of the entire Texas proceeding. **********On Feb. 20, 1986, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, upheld the essence of Judge Brieant's ruling while disavowing his criticism of the Texas proceeding. It ruled that Texaco could appeal in the Texas courts by posting only $1 billion in security for its liability to Pennzoil, which was then about $12 billion, including interest. It was this decision that the Supreme Court agreed last June to review, and overturned today. **********While the Supreme Court appeal was pending, the Texas appeals court upheld, on Feb. 12, all of the jury's $7.53 billion compensatory damages award, while reducing to $1 billion the jury's additional award of $3 billion in punitive damages."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/21/business/market-place-behind-the-fall-at-magellan.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1987-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 877, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Behind the Fall At Magellan", "print_headline": "Market Place; Behind the Fall At Magellan", "body_text": " **********WHEN the net asset value per share of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, the nation's largest stock mutual fund, suddenly plunges 11.41 percent - as it did on Monday - a small army of shareowners wonders in alarm: What on earth is happening? **********Admittedly, the stock market was rather weak that day. But the decline of 13.86 points, to 2,258.66, in the Dow Jones industrial average was merely six-tenths of 1 percent. **********That was nothing compared with the drop in net asset value of $6.71, to $52.09, for each Magellan share. Some shareowners asked: Had Peter Lynch, the portfolio manager with the hottest hand in the mutual fund business over the last 10 years, taken a huge wrong turn in the market? Had the $8.8 billion fund been forced to dump stocks at a loss to meet a tidal wave of redemptions?  * * * **********Nothing of the sort, came the comforting response from Fidelity Investments, the giant Boston-based financial complex that counts Magellan as its flagship fund. **********By far the greatest part of the price decline, a Fidelity spokesman explained, represented a cash distribution of $6.21 a share to some one million shareowner accounts of Magellan, which was effective on Monday. This consisted of $5.84 in capital gains and 37 cents in dividends. As a continuing practice, many shareowners prefer to reinvest such distributions in their mutual funds. In any event, a cash distribution automatically lowers the net asset value, on a per-share basis, of any fund. **********The flurry over the big drop in Magellan's net asset value points up the fact that, in the mutual fund tables carried by newspapers, there is nothing to differentiate a cash distribution from a decline that might result from the dynamics of the stock market. Some mutual fund followers have suggested that distributions be designated by an explanatory symbol in the tables. **********Then, too, many funds do not pinpoint the precise date of when distributions are to be made. The prospectus of the Magellan Fund, for example, simply states that distributions are paid annually in May. **********Last year was an exception in this respect. In May, the fund paid $3.99 a share in capital gains and 46 cents in dividends. Then, in December, Magellan made an additional distribution of $2.85 a share in capital gains, in order for shareowners to receive more favorable tax treatment before the new Federal income tax law took effect in 1987. **********''As an actual practice, many people prefer not to buy shares in a mutual fund shortly before the effective date of any distribution, because these payments are a taxable event for the shareowner,'' said Eric M. Kobren, who heads the Mutual Fund Investors Association in Needham, Mass., an independent organization of shareholders in the 100-plus funds offered by Fidelity Investments. **********The 43-year-old Mr. Lynch took the helm of Magellan 10 years ago and charted the fund on a spectacular winning course. Between March 31, 1977, and March 31, 1987, his fund showed a total return - market gains plus reinvested dividends -of 1,962.33 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Over that period, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was ahead 380.35 percent. **********In an interview, Mr. Lynch said it was unreasonable for investors to assume that Magellan could continue to grow at such a phenomenal rate in the future. ''It is partly a function of the present size of the fund,'' he said. ''But an important consideration, too, is that the stock market now is more fairly priced that it was in the past. In the late 1970's, there were a lot of small growth companies that were overlooked and undervalued.'' **********For a fund with assets of more than $1 billion, he said that ''a reasonable growth target might be to beat the general market by 5 or 6 percent a year.''  * * * **********The Ford Motor Company is Magellan's largest holding, accounting for 4 percent of the fund. Other large positions include the Federal National Mortgage Association, Chrysler, International Business Machines, Ryder System and the Kemper Corporation. The fund owns about 1,800 stocks. **********''Since early this year, we have added to retail stocks, along with automobiles, energy, electronics and railroads,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''We cut back on insurance and utilities and money-center banks. Foreign holdings are now 9 percent of the portfolio, down from 20 percent a year ago.'' **********In the past, Mr. Lynch has turned handsome profits in Chrysler, Volvo and Honda Motor, along with Ford. But for his personal use, the money manager admits that he owns a 10-year-old Concord made by American Motors. And where did he place his Individual Retirement Account contribution? ''This year it was the Magellan Fund,'' he said.

Several caught in the school's central courtyard were dismembered with machetes or shot to death, despite their pleas to be spared. **********The carnage appeared no less horrifying for those trapped inside the classrooms, who tried to hide in corners, behind partitions and under piles of overturned school supplies. **********The killers moved from classroom to classroom killing their victims. Those who were shot died huddled together, to be found and photographed by journalists who arrived soon afterward. Others lay sprawled in pools of blood. **********Haitian radio reports, supported by the accounts of numerous witnesses, said ''at least 15 people'' were killed in the incident at the Ecole Argentine de Bellegarde. Some journalists who visited the school after the massacre thought the death toll was much higher. **********The early-morning blood bath followed a night of sustained automatic gunfire and occasional explosions in the capital. In bright daylight, the courage of the voters who dared line up at polling stations was met with brazen attacks by armed marauders, while soldiers and policemen looked on and, according to some witnesses, took part. **********''There was a lot of blood all over the place,'' said Les Stone, an American photographer. ''The place was all smashed to pieces. I couldn't count all the bodies. We were shot at and just got out as best we could.'' **********Another journalist, David Gollob, a reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, followed a fire truck commandeered by heavily armed soldiers along a stretch of several blocks from the capital's major international hotel to the school. 'An Utter Blood Bath' **********''It was an utter blood bath,'' Mr. Gollob said. ''Some of the dead were children. ''There were about 20 journalists there, with some screaming at others to help remove the injured.'' **********''The first thing we saw as we approached the school was a group of smashed-up cars, some bullet-riddled, some apparently forced off the road,'' abandoned just outside of the school's courtyard, Mr. Gollob said. ''There were dead bodies in the courtyard, and in classrooms everything was turned upside down, books, sewing machines, clothing.'' **********''Dead bodies were crouched together'' in classrooms, he said. ''Others were piled on the ground behind a wall. The police carried away a girl whose leg had been ripped apart. When another woman who had been shot saw them, she began screaming wildly.'' **********Another group of reporters who arrived at the school soon afterward were fired upon by soldiers, leaving one television cameraman from the Dominican Republic, Carlos Grullon, dead, and at least four others wounded, some seriously. Journalists 'Cornered' **********Peter T. Bentley, a contract photographer for Time magazine, said, ''They had us cornered in the school.'' **********''We heard the guns start popping,'' Mr. Bentley said, still visibly shaken. ''We just hopped over walls I couldn't believe I could scale.'' At about the same time, a camera crew for ABC News was attacked at the school. The crew's Haitian driver was shot in the back. Two American crew members were also wounded, one shot in the arm and another in the thigh. **********The ABC News crew managed to return to a downtown hotel that has served as the center for the international press corps, and were treated by doctors summoned by the United States Embassy. **********Joyce Kravitz, a spokeswoman for ABC News in New York, identified the wounded crew members as Javier Carillo, 33 years old, a Mexican camerman who was shot in the thigh, and Alfredo (Chino) Mejia, 29, a Salvadoran soundman who was shot in the elbow. New Outbreak of Firing **********As an ambulance screeched to a stop in front of the hotel to take the Haitian driver - the most seriously wounded member of the ABC News crew - to a local hospital, bursts of automatic gunfire sounded several hundred yards away, on the other side of the downtown area's public park and amphitheater. Hundreds of reporters and international observers scrambled for cover. **********A handful of French and American reporters who were at the school when the soldiers began their attack on journalists fled over schoolyard walls and took refuge in neighboring homes. **********A group of French reporters, alerted that their colleagues were stranded in the neighborhood, mounted a convoy to attempt their rescue, but were turned back by gunfire only two blocks from the hotel. Soldier's Help Is Asked **********A van driven by a Haitian officer accompanied by a soldier armed with an automatic rifle approached the hotel and the French reporters implored them to help extricate their friends. **********The officer replied, ''I am a member of the medical corps, go call the police,'' and drove away. **********An American photographer, J. B. Diederich, who was trapped with another reporter inside a house near the school, managed to telephone the hotel. Reporters then called the American embassy, which dispatched an armored car to rescue him. It was followed by a crew of French reporters, and when it approached the house where Mr. Diederich was hiding, honked four times. The stranded reporters ran out and were whisked away. **********Riding back to the safety of the hotel, Mr. Diederich said: ''The army did the shooting. They shot at me.

These include mastery of one thing well done, recognition and approval needs, success and achievement, security and avoidance of failure. **********''Most of these needs are filled exclusively by the job, which makes termination tough,'' he said. ''We misapprehend the needs of this older group and the psychological trauma involved in job loss, which is even worse if it comes without provocation or warning.'' **********When older middle managers learn of their impending dismissal, their reactions are usually fear first, followed by disbelief that they are about to lose their jobs, anger at the company and, finally, rueful acceptance, Dr. Brittain said. **********Make the break clean and sure, he advised the personnel experts. Often the dismissal is carried out not by an impersonal employment manager but by the employee's own superior. **********He recalled the case of a top executive, charged with dismissing a marketing manager, who said to the manager, ''I think you should give some consideration to whether you should be in this job.'' Rather than this, Dr. Brittain said, there should have been forthrightness. **********According to James E. Challenger, president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago placement company, the older, experienced managers being dismissed in droves these days do find jobs eventually, but usually with much smaller companies. ''They go to smaller companies that need their particular experience,'' he said, often at higher salaries. **********Mr. Challenger said last week that, based on a survey of his clients, half the 50-to-60-year-old employees required a median of more than three and a half months to find a job during the third quarter of 1987, not much longer than job seekers of all ages. A median is a midpoint, meaning that half the older job seekers found employment in three and a half months or less, while the other half took longer. **********Mr. Challenger also noted an increase in age discrimination lawsuits brought by middle-aged losers of jobs, with 54 percent filed by those aged 50 to 59. **********Almost always paid by the companies doing the dismissing, outplacement concerns try to soothe the bitterness and rampant anger of dismissed managers, arguing that they stand much less chance of finding a good job if they sue their former employer. **********However, if severance payments are not generous, many who have lost jobs consider that a lawsuit handled by an able lawyer gives them better odds of receiving what they consider adequate compensation. **********Meanwhile, more and more dismissed older managers, especially those with master of business administration degrees, have been contacting the universities from which they graduated. Many graduate schools of business, such as Columbia and New York University, regularly circulate lists of job openings gleaned from alumni and company personnel managers. **********Although a college contact is always worth a try, few dismissed managers can expect much help from their undergraduate institutions beyond advice on interviewing and resumes. **********Waldo I. Scott. assistant director of career planning for alumni affairs at Colgate University, in Hamilton, N.Y., said last week that ''what I have done is refer a couple of older managers to alumni.'' **********They were former Exxon Corporation managers with six-figure salaries and 16 to 18 years of experience with the company and they did find jobs, he said. Last year he heard from a dozen or more older alumni looking for jobs, but now such requests have pretty much ''dried up,'' he added. **********His alumni board told him that ''your main concern ought to be graduates out three and five years because the older ones should have their own networks,'' he said. **********At Lawrence University, in Appleton, Wis., Gayle Hardt, director of career planning, pointed out a difficulty faced by colleges small and large -finding enough time to help. Lawrence has 1,150 undergraduates who need her advice about summer jobs, internships, careers and jobs after graduation. She runs a one-person office, with the help of a secretary and a part-time assistant. In past years she has received few calls from older alumni who have lost jobs.

But economists have begun to worry that the dollar's rapid fall against the yen in recent days could slow the robust recovery. **********What is most remarkable about this recovery - and most important for the future of Japan's economy -is that it is taking place entirely in the domestic sector, rather than in the export industries that have historically driven Japanese growth. **********Japan's trading partners have long urged the nation to reduce its reliance on exports so that it can cut its huge trade surpluses. While this recovery shows that domestic demand can indeed spur the economy, it is by no means clear that domestic growth is reducing Japanese manufacturers' commitment to export or Japan's trade surplus with the United States. Japan's Idea of a Recession **********Dissatisfaction over Japan's trade surplus prompted the major industrial democracies to drive down the value of the dollar in September 1985. That move led to what the Japanese consider a recession - unemployment rose and corporate profits fell - although there were never two consecutive quarters of economic decline, the standard measure of a recession in the United States. **********Japan's economy began to bounce back in the summer, and its recent domestic growth continue to be strong, with increases in housing starts, industrial production, equipment investment and consumer spending. Despite the dollar's renewed fall, economists say they are not yet lowering their predictions that Japan's economy will grow by more than 3 percent in this fiscal year, which ends in March 1988. **********''The domestic economy is firing on all cylinders right now,'' said Ron Napier, an economist for Salomon Brothers here. **********But economists fear that improvements in the export sector of the economy may be imperiled if the yen continues to rise against the dollar. The dollar closed today in Tokyo at 133.65 yen, a new low. **********As a rule of thumb, said Hidehiro Iwaki, an economist with the Nomura Research Institute, if the yen appreciates against the dollar by 10 yen, the gross national product should drop by 1 percent because Japan's exports will either increase in price or corporate profit margins will fall. The institute is not revising its estimate of 3.2 percent growth for this fiscal year, he said. But if the yen continues to rise, the effects could be felt in the next fiscal year, which begins in April 1988. The institute had predicted 3 percent growth for that year, but is now reducing that estimate, he said. Effect of the Market Plunge **********Other economists are more optimistic. Mr. Napier said that the previous appreciation of the yen against the dollar had been far more severe. ''In 1986, you had months when the yen was up 30 percent from the previous year,'' he said. ''Now we're only talking about 15 to 20 percent if you assume a 125 yen rate. That's brutal, but only about half as brutal as 1986.'' **********Many analysts are worried about the effect of the stock market collapse on the United States economy. If American economic growth slows, Japan's economy will also be hurt because Americans will be less likely to buy Japanese exports. But there have been few signs of an American slowdown since the market's plunge. **********''We were looking for good recovery of corporate profits on the manufacturing side for next year, but not now,'' said Peter J. Morgan, the chief economist for the British investment firm of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. ''Slower United States growth means slower exports, slower investment, slower income growth and slower spending.'' **********Of far less concern to economists is the effect of falling stock prices in Japan. The Nikkei average of 225 stocks dropped 731.91 points today, to 21,686.46 yen, lower than its closing on Oct. 20, when the Tokyo market plummeted after Wall Street's huge selloff. Economists predict, however, that the declines to date will not slow economic growth appreciably. Fewer Japanese Shareholders **********For one thing, Mr. Napier said, relatively few Japanese individuals have extensive stockholdings. Thus, the Japanese have less of their personal wealth tied up in stocks, which means that a severe market decline would not necessarily lead to cutbacks in consumer spending. That possibility has been raised in the United States. Households own about 30 percent of all Japanese equities, compared with household ownership of more than 60 percent in the United States, according to the Federal Reserve Board. **********In addition, Mr. Iwaki said, stock prices in Japan have not fallen nearly as much in percentage terms as they have on stock exchanges in other parts of the world. **********Despite some warning signs, most economists think that economic growth will continue to be brisk. The recovery is being buoyed by strong consumer spending, an infusion of Government public works spending and a boom in housing construction. **********Few statistics are available yet to measure economic growth since mid-October, when stock prices began to dive and the dollar began to fall further. But Mr. Napier said that two reliable indicators of economic growth - tax collections and electricity generation - increased in October from levels of a year earlier. These growth rates were also higher than those recorded in September. Bonuses Are Expected to Rise **********Moreover, consumer spending, already strong, should get an extra lift from the prospect of high winter bonuses this year. Traditionally, employees receive several months' pay as bonuses twice a year. For the past two seasons, bonuses have fallen, but they are expected to increase between 4 and 5 percent, Mr. Napier said, because of the upturn in the Japanese economy. **********Other indexes of domestic demand continued strong in September. Industrial production was up 4.7 percent from the previous year. Growth was particularly strong in manufacturing industries that concentrate on the domestic market, such as chemicals and steel. Retail sales increased 6.9 percent in September. Machinery orders, an indication of companies' capital spending plans, increased 16.9 percent in August. **********Housing starts also rose 26.8 percent in September from the previous year. While the housing boom may slow slightly, Mr. Napier said the Government's decision to ease monetary policy might push mortgage rates lower and therefore spur spending on housing. **********Corporate profits, particularly those in the domestic sector of the economy, are also recovering. Mr. Napier said that preliminary reports of profits in the period from April through September show average increases of 39.2 percent. Lagging Exports **********In contrast to this domestic growth, exports continue to declne, while manufacturing industries primarily dependent on exports are also lagging. Economists predict that the falling dollar and the prospects of slower growth in the United States will further depress exports. **********''Manufacturers are turning to the domestic market,'' said Nobumitsu Kagami, chief economist of the Nomura Investment Management Company. ''With the yen where it is, they feel that exports are no longer as profitable as before, and they are finding more profit opportunities at home.'' **********One example is consumer electronics companies like the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, which sells its products under such brand names as National and Panasonic. Matsushita has reduced its reliance on exports and developed new products like the ''home bakery,'' an automatic bread-baking machine that is a phenomenal success in Japan. **********Automobile companies, which have historically made most of their money from export sales, have also been devoting more attention to the domestic market. Benjamin Moyer, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company in Japan, said that several companies have rushed out new models and have seen a resulting pickup in domestic sales. They have also acted to make the domestic market profitable, switching to less-expensive imported components that reduced manufacturing costs while keeping vehicle prices the same. **********Economists caution, however, that most manufacturers do not consider domestic sales a replacement for exports, and predict that companies will not slacken their export drives. Japan's overall trade surplus has fallen steadily and imports are up sharply, Mr. Napier said. But the improvements do not extend to the United States, whose trade deficit with Japan has dropped only slightly. **********''Too many export industries have such a large unused capacity that they can meet domestic demand and still hunger for more export volume,'' Mr. Napier said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/world/sri-lanka-s-ties-with-india-worsen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 803, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SRI LANKA'S TIES WITH INDIA WORSEN", "print_headline": "SRI LANKA'S TIES WITH INDIA WORSEN", "body_text": " **********The ethnic problems that have burst into violence here in recent weeks have strained relations between Sri Lanka and its powerful northern neighbor, India. **********The two nations, faced with both internal and external problems related to the conflict, have accused each other of encouraging violence. **********Sri Lanka's President, J. R. Jayewardene, said this week that India was taking a ''Hitlerian, not Gandhian,'' approach to the conflict. Military Measures Criticized **********India's External Affairs Minister, Narayan Dutt Tiwari, chided Sri Lanka, which has started a military offensive against Tamil rebels. ''You cannot achieve a political settlement by bombing your own people,'' he said. **********Local and foreign analysts in Colombo say that as the ethnic tensions have grown more intractable, the divisions between the two nations have also become more difficult to resolve. **********The Tamil minority that is agitating for a separate state in the northern and eastern portions of Sri Lanka also forms a powerful ethnic group in the south of India that poses an internal problem for the central Government. **********Political analysts agree that no lasting solution to the problem can be reached without Indian participation. India Called Part of the Problem **********But in recent days, officials in Colombo, including Mr. Jayewardene, have said India itself is part of the problem. **********The ethnic conflict involves Tamil separatists in the northern peninsula of Jaffna, some of whom have taken refuge in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. **********The Tamils make up only 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population - and these are divided between Tamils of the north, the center of militant separatism, and Tamils of the south-central hill country, who are not separatists -but 50 million Tamils live in Tamil Nadu, more than Sri Lanka's total population of 16 million. **********Sri Lanka has complained that guerrillas are being given refuge in Tamil Nadu. If the Indian Government were to join in halting supplies to the rebels, Mr. Jayewardene said last week, ''this war would be over in days.'' **********But political analysts in Colombo said the Government in New Delhi had little political leverage in Tamil Nadu, which is controlled by opposition politicians and where the Tamil issue is a highly emotional one. **********They also said New Delhi might have lost any influence over the Sri Lankan separatist groups who must be brought to the negotiating table. India's Stake in Unrest Cited **********Both Sri Lankan and Western analysts also suggested that India may have a stake in continuing unrest in Sri Lanka, whose independent foreign policy is seen as a threat. **********India is seen as suspicious of Sri Lanka's free-market economic policies and of the possibility that it could be used by the United States for a military role in the Indian Ocean. **********The Indian ambassador, Jyotindra Nath Dixit, in an interview this week, compared his country's relations with Sri Lanka to those of other big nations with small, troublesome southern neighbors. **********Choosing his words carefully, he suggested parallels with the United States and Nicaragua, China and Vietnam, and the Soviet Union and Afghanistan. Plan to Use Force Denied **********Mr. Dixit quickly denied any implication that India contemplated using armed force in Sri Lanka. But a highly placed Sri Lankan official said the Ambassador's remarks were not to be taken lightly. ''Mr. Dixit always says exactly what he means,'' the official said. **********He dismissed the idea that India might use armed force against Sri Lanka, but he said his country was feeling strong and unwelcome pressure from India in resolving its problems. **********He accused the Indians of having aided Tamil guerrillas in an effort to destabilize Sri Lanka but, he said, ''the monster has grown to the point where Indian authorities no longer control it.'' **********India does not want the separatists to succeed in Sri Lanka and set a precedent for its own Tamils or other minorities, he said. But it also hopes to use the continuing unrest as leverage over Sri lanka.''Therefore, it does not want either side to win,'' he said. Indian Backing Seen as Necessary **********A Western diplomat said Sri Lanka, which has stated a hard-line position toward the Tamil guerrillas, was dependent on India for help in reaching a compromise. **********But the diplomat said the fear in Colombo was that ''once the Indians come in, they're not going to go away.'' **********When Sri Lanka called on India for military aid in controlling a Marxist group in 1971, he said, ''they were shocked to see how fast the help came.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/22/jobs/development-and-jobs-speed-along-route-1.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Deitch", "pub_date": "1987-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Job Market", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Development and Jobs Speed Along Route 1", "print_headline": "Development and Jobs Speed Along Route 1", "body_text": " **********NEW JERSEY'S Route 1 corridor, a rapidly developing nine-mile stretch of highway between New Brunswick and the Princeton-Trenton region, has become a magnet for corporate and technological concerns - and for jobs to make them run - as the state's economy continues its boom. **********''New companies are coming in every day on Route 1, and the outlook is phenomenal,'' said Joseph E. Stoye, president of an executive- recruitment firm in Princeton. ''Buildings are going up continuously.'' **********According to Borden R. Putnam, the New Jersey Commissioner of Commerce and Development, Route 1 ''is a tremendously promising area for jobs and careers,'' though he cautioned that ''right at the moment it is a little overbuilt, with a 25 to 30 percent vacancy factor'' that he predicted would be temporary. **********The approximately 75 corporate buildings flanking the corridor, on U.S. Route 1 in Middlesex and Mercer counties, currently house some 750 companies employing 77,000 people. About 160,000 more jobs are expected to be filled on the corridor by the year 2000. **********John P. Keith, president of the Regional Plan Association, a New York-based research organization concerned with the coordinated development of the Jersey, New York and Connecticut area, voiced concern over the broad planning picture in the corridor. ''Although individual Route 1 buildings are well planned,'' he said, ''there has been no overall planning for the corridor, especially as related to transportation and traffic.'' Asked if inadequate transportation and traffic problems might tend to deter people outside the corridor from wanting to work there, Mr. Keith noted that many people struggle to get to work in Manhattan and added: ''If it isn't easy to get to Route 1, people will, nevertheless, accept employment there if the jobs are worth getting to.'' **********One major need in the corridor area is for engineers, especially for the increasing number of electronic and telecommunications companies along the corridor. Another is for bank employees. ''There are a lot of banking jobs -so many that we can't fill them fast enough,'' a result of business expansion and heavy financial activity in the corridor, Mr. Stoye said. Other positions available are for financial analysts, counselors and planners. Consultants should also be in demand; four consulting firms on international business opened in one building in the last year. **********One indication of corporate growth on the highway is membership in the Princeton Chamber of Commerce. Last year, it had 1,100 members, representing hundreds of companies; the figure is now above 2,000. **********At a conference last month in Cherry Hill, N.J., sponsored by the Mid-Atlantic Association of Personnel Consultants, half the participants were executive recruiters seeking to fill openings in banks on Route 1. These include positions as commercial loan officers and other top bank management and staff slots, for the fast-moving financial needs and changes on the strip. United Jersey Banks, the state's largest financial institution, has opened its headquarters here, and more banks are on the way. **********The largest personnel needs of companies on the Route 1 corridor, however, are for back-office employees, business services, sales and marketing personnel at all levels. ''Meat and potatoes people, but paying good salaries, in many cases,'' according to the manager of a personnel agency who did not want to be identified. **********Mr. Stoye, a longtime resident of the area who has observed Route 1 growth from its beginnings about 10 years ago, does not believe that calling the corridor New Jersey's ''Silicon Valley'' is quite justified yet. ''At this time, it is more of a telecommunications type of tech, not the advanced computer-dominated technology that blankets California's Silicon Valley,'' he said. **********Nevertheless, he ticked off the names of many companies that need engineers. They include the RCA Corporation and three of its divisions: American Communications, Astro Electronics and the Sarnoff Research Center; Mobil Research and Development Corporation; E.R. Squibb & Sons, with headquarters at Lawrenceville and laboratories in Franklin Township, and Johnson & Johnson, the medical-supplies company. M.B.A.'s are also needed, ''especially if they are technically oriented,'' Mr. Stoye said. The largest potential employers are the university- and business-related high-technology centers being established by the permanent New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology, which will require staff members for new businesses and joint ventures. The four centers to be built on Route 1 will do research and development in biotechnology and medicine, computer aid to industrial production, food technology and scientific computing. **********Bordering the corridor are acres of former farmland on which houses are going up by the hundreds, convenient for those who work nearby. But the pastoral quality remains, in large part because many of the modern-design buildings are not visible from the highway. One vast complex, for example, is more than a mile off the road. **********Most jobs at companies along the Route 1 corridor pay well, according to Mr. Stoye, including support personnel - secretaries, receptionists, clerical workers and word-processing staff. Secretaries getting $28,000 are not uncommon, he said. **********Though salaries are not as high as in New York, according to William Hogan, president of Management Recruiters in Princeton, they are offset by New Jersey's lower state income tax and by the absence of city taxes. In addition, commuting for most people in the state is much cheaper. **********Houses in the Princeton area along the corridor are more expensive than in Bergen County, near New York City, according to real estate estimates. The average cost of a house in the Princeton area is $250,000, compared with $150,000 in Bergen County. Renting in the corridor, however, is still reasonable. **********Although Route 1 does not yet pose a threat to Silicon Valley, more high-technology companies are settling in. The centerpiece of these new firms will be the supercomputer research center at Princeton University, which will operate one of the world's fastest computers. The center is one project of the state Science and Technology Commission, whose goal is to convert the state from its faded ''smokestack-industry'' image to a high-technology economy. **********Mr. Putnam, the New Jersey Commerce Commissioner, said that the job range on the corridor reflected the state's wide economic diversity. He pointed out that a downturn in one industry - insurance, for example -might be offset by an upturn in banking, with commensurate job opportunities. He said Route 1 was a prime example of such diversity, and added, ''The corridor is the hottest area in the state and will continue to be.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/25/business/business-people-takeover-clouds-future-for-carling-chairman.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1987-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 404, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TAKEOVER CLOUDS FUTURE FOR CARLING CHAIRMAN", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; TAKEOVER CLOUDS FUTURE FOR CARLING CHAIRMAN", "body_text": " **********Pierre Des Marais 2d has been a mayor, president of an aircraft company and, since last October, chairman of Carling O'Keefe Ltd.

Market", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT; London Seeks Part Of A.D.R. Market", "body_text": " **********In recent years, London has watched with alarm as much of the equity trading in Britain's flagship companies has crossed the Atlantic to Wall Street, where non-American shares are bought and sold in the convenient, dollar-denominated form of American depositary receipts. **********In the United States, where once-parochial investors are increasingly buying foreign shares, A.D.R.'s represent one of the fastest-growing segments of the equity market. The National Association of Securities Dealers' over-the-counter market, which handles most A.D.R. issues, saw turnover jump more than 70 percent last year, after a gain of 53 percent in 1985. **********But London is now striking back, trying to bring this lucrative market back home. Starting Monday, A.D.R.'s will be officially traded on London's stock exchange. The receipts represent the stock in non-American companies whose shares remain physically outside the United States. A.D.R.'s can be bought and sold just like the underlying securities. **********''Some of the trading of A.D.R.'s will be brought back to London,'' said Richard Seaward, a trader at County NatWest Ltd., the securities arm of the National Westminster Bank, Britain's largest commercial bank. ''In a few years, we should be taking business away from New York.'' Another Sign of Globalization **********The advent of A.D.R. trading in London is another sign of the growing globalization of the major stock markets. The shares of multinational companies are becoming worldwide commodities that investors can trade almost round the clock. For example, key customers for A.D.R. market makers in London are expected to be American institutional investors eager to take advantage of the five-hour time difference between London and New York to trade in London before Wall Street opens. **********''A lot of Americans will get up very early in the morning, particularly if they've got a big position in an active stock,'' said Vincent Mackney, a director of Warburg Securities Ltd. **********London's A.D.R. bid is also part of a fight for market share in world equity trading, with London and New York the leading rivals. With many countries easing rules on cross-border investment, share trading tends to migrate to the most efficient and liquid markets. Already, for instance, London has strengthened its claim as Europe's major stock market by taking trading away from such Continental bourses as those in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris. Now, it is going after the A.D.R. business. **********''There's a bit of a war for turf going on around the world,'' said James M. Davin, chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers. ''And this A.D.R. move in London is part of that.'' London's Success Uncertain **********Just how successful the London assault on the A.D.R. market will be is uncertain. Some British market experts predict London could grab as much as 20 percent of the A.D.R. market within a year, and more later. London, they say, is the natural market for trading the A.D.R.'s of European companies on the presumption that it is closer to the companies and London stock analysts follow the companies more closely. **********Still, even those most enthusiastic about the move do not foresee a British takeover of A.D.R.'s. ''This will allow London to get a slice of the action,'' said Paul Manson, an analyst for Kleinwort Grieveson, a London brokerage. ''But the main market will remain in the U.S.'' **********For their part, the major American securities houses remain skeptical. Major A.D.R. traders such as Merrill Lynch, Shearson Lehman, Morgan Stanley, First Boston and Goldman, Sachs have all decided against becoming market makers in London for the moment, even though they all have huge London offices. ''We're going to monitor it closely,'' said Mr. Davin, who is also a managing director of the First Boston Corporation. ''And we will make markets in A.D.R.'s in London if our customers want it.'' **********In London, the market makers will display A.D.R. prices and trades on the exchange's automated quotation system. The information will be available simultaneously in the United States to firms linked to London's computerized quote network. Seven Firms Involved **********At the outset, seven firms will be A.D.R. market makers in London, including four British houses: Warburg, Kleinwort Grieveson, County NatWest and Smith New Court. Two American-owned London brokers will also participate, Citicorp's Scrimgeour Vickers and Security Pacific's Hoare Govett. In addition, a New York-based market making specialist, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, will be involved. **********Though more A.D.R.'s are expected to be traded as more market makers join, the start-up list contains just 11 issues, led by such well-known British names as British Petroleum, Shell, Glaxo, Jaguar and Imperial Chemical Industries. At least three firms must make a market in the issue if it is to be traded in London. **********American dealers doubt whether the rather thin market in London can compete with that of the United States, where more than 120 issues are traded and liquidity is far greater. For a popular A.D.R. like Jaguar, for example, there are more than 40 market makers trading its stock on the Nasdaq market in the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/06/business/market-place-employment-agency-niche.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1987-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 859, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Employment Agency Niche", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE; Employment Agency Niche", "body_text": " **********MOST analysts continue to give high marks to the temporary-help business - a niche industry that sprang into the Wall Street spotlight this week on the strength of a surprise takeover bid from abroad. **********On Tuesday, Blue Arrow P.L.C., the leading employment agency in Britain, offered $75 a share for Manpower Inc., the largest worldwide provider of temporary-help services. The market's immediate response was to send Manpower's stock shooting ahead $15.625, to $78. In Big Board trading yesterday, the shares gained 50 cents, to $78.50. **********While the outcome of the bid for Manpower remains uncertain, shares of other leading temporary-help companies in the United States - Kelly Services, the Olsten Corporation and Adia Services - also reached new highs. However, Jerry Levine of Merrill Lynch said these companies are not regarded as acquisition targets because their control rests securely in the hands of founding families or, in the case of Adia, of a Switzerland-based personnel services company. **********Instead, industry analysts said that what has made these stocks attractive is their record of steady profit growth even in the face of a ho-hum domestic economy. For example, earnings of Kelly Services, the nation's largest supplier of temporary personnel, rose from 73 cents a share in 1982 to $2.27 a share in 1986. **********In one sense, temporary-help companies are a beneficiary of the vast restructuring that has occurred in American industry since the early 1980's, said Judith Scott of Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. ''As companies concentrated on reducing fixed costs, they realized the advantages and flexibility of using temporary workers in clerical, marketing, industrial and other capacities,'' she said. ''And as demand for new skills increased in such areas as computer programming and data processing, the service companies moved quickly to fill the need at the same time their own training procedures grew more sophisticated.'' **********One advantage, too, of hiring temporary help is that companies avoid paying for fringe benefits. These benefits are shouldered instead by the service companies. **********Mr. Levine of Merrill Lynch carries a ''buy'' investment rating for both Kelly Services and Olsten. ''I estimate earnings of Kelly Services at $2.85 a share this year and, for 1988, profits could show a further gain of 22 to 25 percent,'' he said. **********Olsten earned 75 cents a share in 1986, after adjustment for a recent 3-for-2 stock split. Mr. Levine projects profits of between 97 cents and $1 a share for this year. His estimate for 1988 is for earnings to increase by 25 percent to 30 percent. **********Mrs. Scott of Robert W. Baird & Company also continues to regard Kelly Services and Olsten as ''buys.'' Her estimates call for Kelly to earn $2.85 a share this year and $3.35 in 1988. As for Olsten, she envisions profits of $1 a share in 1987 and $1.20 next year. **********Both analysts said that profits for Kelly and Olsten will be enhanced in 1988 by the effect of lower corporate tax rates. **********Fran Blechman Bernstein, the Merrill Lynch analyst who follows buy-rated Adia Services, estimates net income at between $1.05 and $1.15 a share this year and at between $1.30 and $1.40 in 1988. Last year, the company earned 76 cents a share. **********D. Christine King of Kidder, Peabody & Company accords shares of Kelly Services a top rating for price performance over 9 to 12 months. Both Olsten and Adia Services are rated a notch lower and expected to outperform the general market moderately. **********The Value Line Investment Survey, which sees increased competition looming for Kelly Services, rates the stock as an average market performer in the next 6 to 12 months, despite its forecast of a 20 percent gain in earnings for 1987. It expects Olsten to outperform the market in the coming year. **********On the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Olsten rose 50 cents, to $27.25. The shares have doubled within the last 52 weeks. In over-the-counter trading, Kelly Services gained 75 cents, to $64.25. Its shares have quadrupled in price since mid-1984. Adia Services rose 12.5 cents, to $28.625. Another small but fast-growing company in the field is Uniforce Temporary Personnel. Its shares fell 50 cents, to $12.75, yesterday, after selling as low as $4 within the past year. **********Despite the bright future most analysts envision for the temporary-help companies, their growth could slow abruptly in the event of a severe economic recession. The last recession, for example, pared the profits of Kelly Services from $1.10 a share in 1981 to 73 cents the following year. In the similar period, Olsten's earnings dropped from 43 cents a share to 31 cents. **********''One advantage of this industry is that it is neither capital intensive nor burdened with debt,'' noted Mrs. Scott. ''Thus, the hope is that temporary-help companies could pull in their horns and weather a recession fairly well.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/18/business/chrysler-pricing-plans.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chrysler Pricing Plans", "print_headline": "Chrysler Pricing Plans", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation said today that in some cases it would keep prices steady on its 1988 model domestic cars and in other cases raise them by as much as 5 percent.

A Country Between Cultures **********After seven years of the Soviet military presence, Afghanistan seems to be a country caught between cultures and political allegiances. To a visitor familiar with the Soviet Union, it seemed a country with a Soviet system but not a Soviet soul. **********The topography alone - towering mountain ranges and isolated valleys, huge areas of uninhabited desert -seems to form a natural barrier to the centralized ethos of Marxism-Leninism. **********During a carefully controlled five-day visit by foreign reporters the authorities portrayed Afghanistan differently. They described it as a country living harmoniously under Communism with a party, Government and people dedicated to building a new Socialist order. 'Our Great Northern Neighbor' **********The Soviet Union, described by the Afghan leader, Najib, as ''our great northern neighbor,'' was depicted as a generous guarantor of security against foreign aggression and a source of political inspiration. **********Travel and meetings were arranged by the authorities to support these images, and independent reporting was discouraged. Apart from a brief trip to the provincial city of Jalalabad and the surrounding countryside near the Pakistan border, the reporters were confined to Kabul, the capital. **********But even with the constraints, it was apparent that the reality of Afghanistan was a good deal more intricate, involving a volatile political and social chemistry in which Soviet influence is strong but not completely dominant. **********Under the ostensibly cohesive Socialist surface, there were clearly powerful opposing forces. These included longstanding tribal tensions and distrust of central authority, the growing appeal of Islamic fundamentalism and bitter divisions within the Afghan Communist movement itself. No Quick End in Sight **********Combined with a long history of opposition to foreign intervention, these forces seem likely to impede a political settlement of the seven-year war, the formation of a credible coalition government and the withdrawal of the estimated 120,000 Soviet troops here. **********''Afghanistan has never been one nation, and it is not under Communism,'' one Western diplomat said. ''Historically, it is a land of many peoples and cultures that resisted central authority. Afghanistan in its natural state is an unruly patchwork of autonomous valleys and villages. **********''Moscow cannot Sovietize Afghanistan unless it colonizes it, and that would require an act of conquest, which is not in the cards,'' the diplomat added. ''Afghanistan is a Soviet satellite but not the 16th Soviet republic.'' An Afghan Politburo **********Some in the West have compared Afghanistan, which before the beginning of the war had a population of 15.4 million, to Soviet Central Asia, contending that it was rapidly becoming indistinguishable from the Uzbek and Tadzhik republics just across the Soviet border. **********The Afghan political system is unmistakably patterned on the Soviet Union's, with power held by the Communist Party, known officially as the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. The party apparatus includes a Central Committee, Politburo and Secretariat, with Mr. Najib serving as General Secretary of the Central Committee. **********As in Moscow, there is a nominal parliament, the Revolutionary Council, and the president of the council fills the largely ceremonial role of head of state. #9,000 Soviet Civilian Advisers The Government bureacracy is filled with Soviet advisers who, one diplomat said, ''sit at the elbow of every important Afghan official.'' Diplomats said there were about 9,000 Soviet civilian advisers in Kabul. **********The powerful and repressive secret police, the Khad, which Mr. Najib headed until he became a party secretary in December 1985, has close ties to the K.G.B., the Soviet state security agency, Western diplomats said. **********With the grafting of the Soviet political system have come Communist rituals and slogans, some with an Afghan accent, that were familiar to a visitor from Moscow. Officials greeted each other as ''comrade'' and lavished praise on the party and the Afghan revolution. **********In a speech to the National Fatherland Front, a coalition of pro-Government groups, Mr. Najib, echoing words spoken by dozens of officials at the Soviet party congress last February, declared, ''In the current stage of the revolution our main duty is to restructure all spheres of life in Afghan society.'' Less Equality in Kabul **********The director of a state farm near the Pakistan border proudly told visiting reporters that 500 farm workers were loyal party members, some serving on local party committees. ''Everyone from the director to field workers lives in the same kind of housing,'' he said. **********Such equality appeared not to be the rule in Kabul, where residents and Western diplomats said senior party activists and leaders enjoy special privileges, including spacious new apartments and special clinics - privileges common for party members in the Soviet Union. **********Afghan television mirrored Soviet programming, with an emphasis on ideologically safe themes. The evening news program offered a mix of pro-Government and anti-American reports. **********The Government-controlled information outlets, mimicking Pravda and Izvestia, published texts of party declarations and speeches by Mr. Najib, who only uses one name, on the front page under flattering headlines. Education System Reorganized **********The main article in the Jan. 13 edition of The Kabul New Times, an English-language paper, began, ''Comrade Najib, General Secretary of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan Central Committee, took part in a grand function devoted to the seventh anniversary of the State Security Ministry.'' **********The education system, according to Western diplomats, has been reorganized along Soviet lines, with intense indoctrination woven into the curriculum beginning in kindergarten. Western diplomats said 40,000 Afghan students were enrolled in Soviet universities. **********Black Volgas, tan Zhigulis and other Soviet-made cars cruised the streets of Kabul. As in Moscow, access to official cars seemed to carry a license to drive three times the speed limit and to ignore traffic lights. **********Russian rivals English, and may have surpassed it, as the preferred foreign language. Nearly all Afghan civilian and military officials speak Russian and use it to converse with representatives from Moscow, according to Afghan aides who accompanied the reporters almost everywhere they went. Mailbox Labeled in Russian **********Most shopkeepers in Kabul and Jalalabad started conversations with foreigners in Russian, and were surprised to find some visitors were Americans. **********Afghan children roaming the bazaar in Jalalabad, apparently thinking they were approaching a group of Russians, told Western reporters in Russian that they could arrange female companionship for the right price. One Afghan urchin reeled off a series of Russian expletives that would have made an adult Muscovite blush. **********At the Spinghar Hotel in Jalalabad the mailbox nailed to the wall was labeled with the Russian word for ''post.'' **********Western diplomats said that Afghan cultural traditions had survived the Soviet military intervention, but that nonconformist writing and art had been discouraged and the intellectual life of Kabul had moved underground. 'Serious Scholars Have Fled' **********''The university, built with American and British aid, is a shell filled with Communist cant,'' one Western diplomat said. ''Serious Afghan scholars have fled abroad.'' **********Despite the Soviet influence, Afghanistan seemed to have retained a diversity and spontaneity rarely found in the Soviet Union. Afghans and Western diplomats said that efforts to impose central management on the economy were defeated by a feisty free-market spirit rooted in Afghanistan's historic role as a trade crossroads between Europe and Asia. **********The variety of goods available in shops in Kabul and Jalalabad were remarkable by Soviet standards. Electronics stores were crammed with Japanese tape decks and stereos. Grocery stores carried a dizzying variety of Soviet, American, British, French, Italian and Chinese goods. **********Money changers in the Kabul bazaar handed foreigners bags full of Afghan money at triple the Government exchange rate. American dollars were welcomed like gold, rubles dismissed with a flick of the hand as almost worthless. Anti-Government Demonstrations **********Almost anything that could be sold was, including gallon cans of vegetable oil sent to many countries by Washington as part of American foreign assistance. The cans were marked: ''Furnished by the people of the United States of America. Not to be sold.'' **********One Kabul shopkeeper, glancing up from another transaction, said the cans were priced at $10 apiece. **********Political diversity, while limited by Western standards, appeared to exceed the Soviet norm. Western diplomats reported that the removal last May of Babrak Karmal as party chief ignited several anti-Government demonstrations. The diplomats speculated that he was removed because he had been identified with the Soviet intervention since 1979, and the Russians wanted a fresh face to lead a peace offensive. **********They said that Soviet troops and armor were called into Kabul to guard Government and party installations during the Central Committee meeting during which Mr. Karmal was ousted. **********As late as October, Karmal supporters openly showed their enthusiasm for the ousted leader, showering him with flowers and applause when he appeared at ceremonies marking the withdrawal of six Soviet regiments. Infighting Threatens Stability **********Mr. Karmal has not been seen in public for several months. Mr. Najib told the visiting reporters that the former leader was living quietly in retirement in Kabul, tending to personal affairs. **********Afghans and foreign diplomats said infighting between the two main groups in the Communist Party, the Parcham and Khalq factions, posed a serious threat to stability, including the possibility of a coup attempt some day. **********The Parchamites, Persian-speaking Communists allied with Moscow, have held sway within the party since the Soviet intervention in 1979. The Khalqs, who generally speak Pushtoon, are considered less elitist and not enthusiastic about the Soviet presence. **********Tribal antagonisms remain strong, not only between those allied with the Government and those who constitute the bulk of the guerrilla fighters, called mujahedeen, but within the opposing camps, diplomats said. Bad Blood Between Tribes **********The Western-supported insurgents have struggled to maintain a common front at the insistence of Washington, but bad blood among Afghan tribes goes back centuries. In addition, Islamic fundamentalism has become a growing factor in domestic affairs, diplomats said. **********Efforts by Mr. Najib to expand the role of women have offended many religious Afghans, and Moslem leaders have made clear they oppose the establishment of a Communist regime supported by Soviet troops. **********Mr. Najib, apparently sensitive to the Islamic threat, has called for religious tolerance. As part of his plan for national reconciliation, he has encouraged party and Government groups to establish links with Islamic organizations. Many Islamic leaders have links to the fundamentalist movement in Iran, which shares a long border with Afghanistan. **********The visiting reporters were taken to a Kabul mosque where they were told that the Government supported unobstructed worship. Unified Nation Called Unlikely **********Several Afghans said Mr. Najib's efforts to court the Moslem community were undermined recently when he was shown praying at a mosque with his shoes on, a serious breach of religious practice. **********Western diplomats said these divisive factors would make it extremely difficult to bring about the kind of national reconciliation outlined by Mr. Najib. **********''Even if the rebels lay down their arms, the millions of refugees return home and the Soviets leave, there can't be a unified Afghanistan,'' one diplomat said. ''Central authority just goes against the grain of these people.'' **********Recently, as Afghan tribal leaders assembled here for a meeting, a nearby bookseller was hawking Russian periodicals. **********The Afghan patriarchs approached the merchant's table one after another, stared momentarily at a handwritten sign advertising ''Books and magazines from the U.S.S.R.,'' then handed the man a coin and picked up a copy of the local Persian-language newspaper. **********Over the next four hours, as the tribesmen were harangued by a parade of foreign and Afghan speakers, including Mr. Najib, some of them surreptitiously read Islamic texts hidden in the folds of their robes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/21/business/company-news-one-time-gains-lift-mci-net.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1987-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 666, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "One-Time Gains Lift MCI Net", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; One-Time Gains Lift MCI Net", "body_text": " **********The MCI Communications Corporation, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier after the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said yesterday that profits in the first quarter had increased 26.3 percent, to $25 million, from the first quarter of 1986. **********However, MCI's results included a $5 million tax credit and a $12 million pretax gain resulting from an antitrust settlement with the Bell System. Without these one-time gains, MCI's earnings would have been about $11 million, a decline of about 44 percent, the Washington-based company said. **********Three of the regional telephone companies formed in the 1984 breakup of A.T.& T. - the Bell Atlantic Corporation, U S West Inc. and the BellSouth Corporation - reported substantial increases in net income. **********Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, said its profits rose 6.1 percent; U S West, based in Denver, posted a 13.5 percent increase; and BellSouth, based in Atlanta, had a 7.7 percent gain. **********Analysts said the results at the three regional telephone companies were generally in line with their projections. They predicted that earnings at the regional telephone companies would decrease as the Baby Bells reach the ceilings on their rates of return. **********MCI said net income in the first quarter was $25 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with $19.8 million, or 8 cents a share, for the comparable quarter a year earlier. Revenues rose 16.5 percent, to $995 million, from $819.4 million. **********Notwithstanding one-time benefits, MCI's profits in the first quarter contrasted sharply with its results in the 1986 fourth quarter, when the company posted a $502.5 million loss because of charges resulting from inventory write-downs and a restructuring of operations. Analysts said the company's earnings had benefited somewhat from a cost-cutting program. **********Although revenue grew during the quarter, MCI said operating income remained flat at about $52 million because of higher local connection fees. These access charges increased by $130 million, to $477 million, practically matching the company's revenue growth, which was $135 million, according to William E. Conway, MCI's chief financial officer. **********MCI said that despite a March 1 rate reduction of about 9 percent its revenue had increased 4 percent since December. The price cut was in response to similar reductions by A.T.& T. that resulted from lower local access charges paid by long-distance companies. **********Analysts said the MCI results met their expectations, but they forecast a rough year with another rate cut ahead.  U S West **********U S West said its profits were $204.2 million, or $1.08 a share, for the first three months of the year, compared with $179.9 million, or 94 cents a share, in the 1986 period. Revenues were essentially flat, at $2.04 billion, compared with $2.03 billion a year ago. **********Jack MacAllister, U S West's chairman and chief executive, said the company's profits were reduced $23.6 million, or 12 cents a share, by a one-time expense related to an incentive plan to reduce the number of employees. U S West also took a $6.6 million charge related to a refund order in Oregon.  Bell Atlantic **********Bell Atlantic reported first-quarter net income of $307.5 million, or $1.54 a share, compared with $289.9 million, or $1.45 a share, in the 1986 quarter. Revenues rose 4.2 percent, to $2.46 billion, from $2.36 billion. **********Thomas E. Bolger, chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected the impact of growth in regional business on Bell Atlantic's network services companies and improved earnings in its non-telephone operations.  BellSouth **********BellSouth posted a profit of $452.4 million, or 94 cents a share, up from $420 million, or 91 cents a share, in the 1986 quarter.

This would apparently reduce the Soviet Union to a bystander in the process, an arrangement that pleases Washington but does not seem likely to be accepted by Moscow. Reported Meeting in London **********The memorandum's main provisions were reportedly negotiated at a meeting last month in London between King Hussein of Jordan and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, and its final language is said to have been polished with the help of the United States's special Middle East envoy, Wat T. Cluverius 4th, who has been shuttling between Jerusalem and Amman. **********According to information from the diplomatic sources, the document contains two sections that are to be made public if the Israeli Cabinet agrees. Under the first provision, the Secretary General of the United Nations would invite the five permanent members of the Security Council - the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France - to convene a conference based on Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, which envision an Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories and imply the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Committees for Discussions **********The second part provides for the conference to invite ''geographical bilateral committees'' to conduct negotiations, according to the sources. **********The third part, which was to have been kept secret, reportedly says the conference would not impose any solution or veto any accord reached by the bilateral committees. This is described as a commitment that Jordan has made to the United States, and that the United States would convey to Israel. **********In that way, Jordan provides for the first time a clear definition of the severely curtailed powers it envisions for the international conference. **********King Hussein has called for a conference to provide an umbrella of legitimacy for direct talks between a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and Israel. The Reagan Administration has endorsed the idea on the condition that the Russians not be invited into a prominent diplomatic role. **********Meanwhile, although Mr. Peres has accepted King Hussein's idea of making a conference a prerequisite for direct talks, his coalition partner, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, has not. Mr. Shamir has argued that it is dangerous to allow the Soviet Union to gain a foothold in a conference, and that the language in the agreement dealing with the Palestinians is too favorable to the Palestine Liberation Organization. A Basic Difference **********The political infighting in Israel turns on an essential difference between Mr. Peres's Labor Party, which is willing to consider relinquishing some control over the occupied West Bank, and Mr. Shamir's Likud bloc, which wants to hold the territory indefinitely. In both factions' efforts to sway the Reagan Administration, they have been leaking details of the Jordanian-Israeli understanding. **********The director general of Prime Minister Shamir's office, Yosef Ben-Aharon, is scheduled to arrive in Washington this week to try to persuade the Administration that inviting Moscow would be dangerous. Mr. Peres arrives next week. **********The entire issue may be moot, however, unless the Soviet Union agrees to the restrictions on an international conference. Soviet officials who have spoken with Westerners recently have endorsed the idea that a conference would break up into two-party negotiating committees but have expressed their opposition to any ''separate deal'' that would not have the blessing of the full conference. Israelis Have Leaked Details **********Most details about the agreement have been divulged in Israel. Initially supporters of Mr. Peres made some details known to advance the idea that the accord opens a chance for peace in the region. Later Mr. Shamir's backers provided additional details to show their concern about the language of the accord. The Jordanian Government has said little about the terms of the reported agreement. **********It is not clear how much official discussion there has been with Russians on these matters. State Department officials were asked about this, but the question went unanswered today. **********The secret section of the Jordanian-Israeli memorandum reportedly repeats an earlier Jordanian agreement to arrange for Palestinian representation in a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and says explicitly that the Palestinian issue will be negotiated in the two-party committee, with the Israelis on one side and the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation on the other. **********This appears to minimize the influence of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which would presumably be invited to attend the main conference, provided it accepted the Security Council resolutions and renounced violence and terrorism. **********But unless the P.L.O. had a role in selecting and giving guidance to the Palestinians on the Jordanian delegation, it would apparently be pushed to the sidelines of the negotiations. **********Again, this may not be acceptable to the Soviet Union, which is expected to coordinate its position with the P.L.O., Syria and other Arabs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/25/business/key-rates-572187.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/23/world/ehthiopians-officially-joining-ranks-of-communist-nations.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1987-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EHTHIOPIANS OFFICIALLY JOINING RANKS OF COMMUNIST NATIONS", "print_headline": "EHTHIOPIANS OFFICIALLY JOINING RANKS OF COMMUNIST NATIONS", "body_text": " **********Thirteen years after military officers overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie, this country today became the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, with a Marxist party as the ''guiding force of the state.'' **********The changes went into effect as Ethiopia's leader, Lieut.

Company officials today called the restructuring proposal ''the largest ever in the electrical utility industry.'' **********The proposal, filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, requires approval by Public Service's stockholders and the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, as well as S.E.C. clearance. State's Biggest Utility **********Public Service, the state's largest utility, owns one-third of the Seabrook plant, which has been denied an operating license because it lacks complete emergency evacuation plans. In August, Robert J. Harrison, president of the company, said that the utility would run out of money by the end of the year unless it charged customers an emergency rate increase of 15 percent. **********To get permission to impose the rate increase, the New Hampshire Supreme Court would have to declare unconstitutional a state law passed in 1979 that prohibits utilities from passing on to customers costs incurred through construction projects that are not in commercial operation.

At the time, the company also put into effect a stringent cost-reduction program, and officials said today that it had reduced internal costs $30 million this year and pared its staff by 150. **********If securities holders agree to the proposal outlined today, company officials say that Public Service will be able to stave off bankruptcy until 1990 without the Seabrook plant's becoming operational.

Although the circumstances of his death were unclear, the news upset many relatives, who had appealed to military authorities to conduct the military training at a base near Boaco rather than in combat zones.

LINE STIRS SHOW", "body_text": " **********Manufacturers of small computers, still uncertain about how to react to I.B.M.'s announcement of a new line of personal computers, had more to say than to show at a major desktop computer trade show here. **********Two months after I.B.M. announced its Personal System 2 line of desktop computers, a few smaller computer companies have moved to capitalize on the new system. But, as expected, the majority of hardware, software and add-on manufacturers continued to show products that are compatible with the International Business Machines Corporation's older PC line of products. **********''With eight million of the old PC's out there it is going to take three or four years for the new line to catch up - if it does,'' said Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive of PC's Limited, an Austin, Tex., company that makes I.B.M.-compatible computers. His company is displaying only a line of computers similar to the old I.B.M. line. **********''That standard has not stopped or lost momentum just because I.B.M. made an announcement,'' he said. Some Showing Both Lines **********On the other hand, several makers of add-on products were showing lines for both the old and new I.B.M. computers. ''We don't make a decision to support a particular standard or not to support it; we move with the market,'' said J. Leland Strange, chairman and chief executive of Intelligent Systems, a Norcross, Ga., company that makes add-on boards for both old and new systems. **********The new I.B.M. line ''is another product that people are certainly going to want to buy,'' Mr. Strange said. His company's Quadram division introduced several products for the new I.B.M. line, including add-on memory boards and color monitors compatible with the new I.B.M. graphics standard. **********But even companies such as Quadram that wish to support the new I.B.M. line are finding difficulties. ''I.B.M. has already locked in a lot of the parts capacity we need,'' said Jim Lindenmayer, Quadram systems manager, referring to orders that I.B.M. has placed with manufacturers of some components of the new system. **********Although Quadram was demonstrating a new communications device for the Personal System/2 line, Mr. Lendenmayer acknowledged that his company would have to stand in line behind I.B.M. until the fall to get enough volume of a critical part to begin full production of the new device. **********For software manufacturers, the problems are slightly different. Michael Burdick, marketing manager of Paperback Software, which is based in Berkeley, Calif., noted that his company had just introduced a new graphics program designed to run on the I.B.M. PC. But because the new models have a different graphics standard, his company's product will have to be modified. **********Interest in the new I.B.M. line, as well as a modest upswing in the small-computer market generally, helped increase attendance at Comdex, one of two small-computer trade shows held annually in the United States. Sheldon G. Adelson, chairman of the Interface Group, which sponsors the show, said 45,000 manufacturers, dealers and members of the press are expected to attend the show, which lasts through Thursday. 'Renewed Excitement' **********''Our pre-registration is up 35 percent, and that is just a result of renewed excitement in the industry,'' Mr. Adelson said. ''Two years ago, the companies in the personal computer business were talking about growth rates of 5 to 10 percent a year. This year, most of the people I talk to are expecting 25 or 30 percent growth.'' **********Part of the renewed interest has been spurred, he said, by the new I.B.M. products. **********''You now have three standards -the Apple standard, the old I.B.M. PC standard and the new I.B.M. PS/2 standard,'' said Frank Girard, vice president of sales and marketing for NEC Information Systems Inc. ''I don't think there is anyone who can tell you how fast the PS/2 standard is going to catch on.'' **********Mr. Girard said that some of NEC's largest personal computer customers had stopped ordering computers shortly before I.B.M.'s April 2 announcement of the PS/2. But after the announcement, he said, users concluded that ''they would not have to throw out what they had.'' The result was a surge of orders for NEC's old-style PC compatibles that still has the Boxborough, Mass., company blacklogged, he said. Packaging 'Breakthrough' **********The new I.B.M. computers ''are not a breakthrough in technology but they are a breakthrough in packaging,'' said Jerry Bower, product manager for AST Research Inc., an Irvine, Calif., maker of add-on products for I.B.M. computers. **********His company, which competes directly with Quadram in the add-on computer market, has a series of similar products for the new line of computers. **********''It is too early to tell what corporate America will make of these machines,'' Mr. Bower said. ''About 30 percent will probably buy anything I.B.M. makes. Another 30 percent probably won't change from what they have no matter what I.B.M. does, and 40 percent are somewhere in the middle.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/04/business/yugoslav-debt-position.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "YUGOSLAV DEBT POSITION", "print_headline": "YUGOSLAV DEBT POSITION", "body_text": " **********Yugoslavia may face problems repaying its $20 billion foreign debt, but it does not plan to follow Brazil in suspending debt interest payments, according to a senior Government official.

Such a move would confront motorists, smokers, drinkers and telephone users with the steepest rise in Federal excise taxes ever. **********Legislators have dismissed the idea of raising income taxes so soon after last year's overhaul. And in the face of specific threats by President Reagan to veto any increase in income tax rates, lawmakers believe that excise taxes are the only kind that the White House might ultimately accept. **********Congress has frequently turned to excise taxes to fill small budget gaps, adding pennies to the cost of a pack of cigarettes or a bottle of bourbon to raise a few billion dollars. This year, they are being counted on to raise far more money than that. 'Will Be Exceedingly Difficult' **********Tax writers say they must choose several targets and squeeze them much tighter than political considerations would ordinarily permit if they are to raise the $18 billion. That is the amount called for by the Senate budget plan and a previously passed House package. **********''I spent the weekend going over the list,'' Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said of the options, adding that it would ''be exceedingly difficult'' to find the $18 billion. **********Among the proposals being discussed are a doubling of the cigarette excise tax; an increase in the gasoline tax of 10 cents a gallon or the introduction of a $5-a-barrel oil import fee; as much as a 49-cent increase in the tax on a six-pack of beer, and as much as a 52-cent rise in the tax on a bottle of wine. **********With such proposals expected to draw heavy fire from affected consumers and industry groups, tax writers see a difficult challenge in trying to meet the House and Senate targets with excise taxes - if the President agrees to $18 billion in new taxes. **********''You can hit excise taxes very hard and still not get to $18 billion,'' said Representative Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. **********The proposed gasoline tax rise or the oil import fee, for example, would meet only about half the revenue gap, according to the Congressional Budget Office's estimates. Doubling the cigarette tax would raise an additional $3 billion. Raising taxes on beer and wine to the alcohol-equivalent rate on distilled spirits would raise $4 billion. Extending the expiring 3 percent tax on telephone service would raise just over $1 billion. **********Over all, excise taxes, which are placed on designated commodities, would have to be raised by 55 percent to meet the House and Senate budget targets. These taxes now bring in about $33 billion a year. **********Even if the tax target turns out to be less than $18 billion, the outcome of the excise tax debate holds important implications for pocketbooks and also for industries, regions of the country and the overall health of the economy. A Political Issue **********The debate may also influence next year's elections. Democrats are reluctant to impose a sharp tax increase on beer because the beverage is seen as a symbol of blue-collar America, a traditional constituency they do not want to upset. An oil-import fee is embraced by oil-producing states, but fiercely opposed by Northeastern representatives because of its impact on heating oil prices. **********Meanwhile, higher gasoline taxes will be fought by members of Congress from Western and Southern states, where constituents tend to drive long distances. Tobacco states will fight higher cigarette taxes and California representatives will be working to ward off higher taxes on wine. **********Industry lobbyists are already mobilizing. An ad-hoc coalition of industry groups, including the American Automobile Association, the American Truckers Association and two dozen other trade assocations met recently to map strategy to fight fuel tax increases. **********The truckers' group is also leading another coalition, which includes wine, beer and tobacco industry groups, to campaign against all kinds of excise tax increases. These organizations have fresh battle experience. Last year, they were successful in helping to quash a proposal in the Senate Finance Committee to include a excise tax increase as part of its income tax overhaul plan. Prices Distorted **********Excise taxes are not a favorite of economists, either. ''If you gave me carte blanche and asked how you would raise revenue, I think excise taxes would rank fairly low on everybody's list,'' said Emil Sunley, national director of tax analysis at the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells and a former Treasury official. **********One failing is that excise taxes distort the prices of goods and are inflationary. Another problem is that most excise taxes are regressive, meaning they hit the poor harder than the rich. The reason is that poor people spend a larger proportion of their income on commodities that are subject to excise taxes. Income taxes, by contrast, impose a progressively larger burden as one moves up the income scale. **********According to a recent study by the Congressional Budget Office, the average increase in excise taxes as a percentage of total income would be about twice as large for families with incomes of $10,000 to $20,000 as it would be for families with incomes of $50,000 or more. It would be about three times as large in the case of beer or tobacco taxes. Only airline excise taxes, now earmarked solely for airport maintenance and improvements and part of the operating costs of the Federal Aviation Administration, are slightly progressive across income lines. **********State governments also do not like the Federal Government to increase excise taxes because they encroach on a tax base that states rely on. Rise Called Overdue **********But some tax economists think a big increase in Federal excise taxes is long overdue and can serve to promote important social and national policy objectives. **********For example, beer and wine taxes have not been raised since 1951. Distilled spirits taxes were raised in 1985, making many in Congress reluctant to hit this category so soon. But the tax now represents only 27 percent of the average price of liquor, compared with 43 percent in 1951. Although the cigarette tax was doubled, to 16 cents a pack, in 1983, the tax now represents only about 15 percent of the price of a pack of cigarettes, compared with 42 percent in 1951. **********Over all, excise taxes account for 4 percent of total Federal revenue, compared with 18 percent in 1951. **********''I think the excise tax structure is extremely low by any standard,'' said Joseph A. Pechman, a tax expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''It's true that these taxes are somewhat regressive, but I think poor people should be discouraged from smoking and drinking as well. And there is an overriding national interest in encouraging oil conservation.'' **********Increases in alcohol and tobacco taxes are also viewed as compensation for the health and safety costs that smokers and drinkers impose on society. **********George Thompson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said he believed that any excise tax increase would have only a modest impact on alcohol and cigarette consumption. But there could be some visible shifts within these industries. **********A big excise tax increase on cigarettes, he said, would probably encourage more smokers to switch to discount brands, now the fastest-growing segment of the market. In addition, purchases from vending machines, normally the most expensive outlet, might decline. The Effect on Brewers **********Beer is a different story, though. Mr. Thompson said the major brewers, whose brands are widely advertised and have a loyal following, were unlikely to be affected much by a tax increase. But smaller brewers could be hurt. ''The ones that will get impacted most significantly are the weaker links,'' he said. ''If you put it on those brands that sell purely on price, the tax is a big negative.'' **********Studies indicate that a big tax increase would discourage smoking and drinking among youngsters, although consumption may not decline much among adults. Teen-agers, with limited spending money, tend to be sensitive to price increases, according to Michael Grossman, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and a professor at the City University of New York Graduate School According to a recent study that Professor Grossman co-wrote, an increase in beer taxes to the alcohol-equivalent rate of distilled spirits would save 1,000 people a year among those aged 18 to 20 from alcohol-related automobile deaths. The tax increase would also reduce by 11 percent the number of youths between the ages of 16 and 21 who drink beer at least every other day, the study added. **********To equal the tax on distilled spirits, the tax on a six-pack of beer would have to be raised to 65 cents, from 16 cents, and the tax on a bottle of wine to 55 cents, from 3 cents. **********According to a study of cigarette taxes that Professor Grossman helped to develop, the number of smokers between the ages of 12 and 17 would decline by 1.2 percent for each 1 percent increase in the price of cigarettes. Oil Tax Proposals **********The most vigorous debate is likely to be over oil taxes. The main proposals are for an oil import fee and higher gasoline taxes. Their effects are very different. **********An oil import fee is favored by Senator Bentsen and other oil-state lawmakers since it would drive up domestic oil prices and provide relief to American producers hurt by the plunge in world oil prices. **********The import fee would also promote energy conservation and reduce this country's dependence on foreign oil. A $5-a-barrel import fee would reduce imports by 1.2 million barrels a day and cut domestic consumption by the same amount, according to an analysis by Data Resources Inc., an economic forecasting concern. **********But critics contend that an import fee is a threat to long-term national security. It is a ''drain America first'' policy, they argue, using up scarce domestic reserves instead of lower-cost foreign supplies. Economic Impact a Concern **********The higher oil prices that would result from an import fee would also lead to slower economic growth and higher inflation, according to Data Resources, because all sectors of the economy would be affected. Data Resources concluded that an import fee might exacerbate, rather than ease, the Federal deficit problem. **********By contrast, gasoline taxes would have a much smaller impact on consumer energy bills in particular and on the economy in general because gasoline does not have as much bearing on the manufacturing process. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, favors a rise in gasoline taxes, as do many in the House from the Middle West and Northeastern states. **********But gasoline taxes would not be as effective in reducing energy dependence. Data Resources estimates that the oil import fee would be six times more effective in reducing imports than an increase in gasoline taxes, and four times more effective in reducing domestic energy consumption. **********The tax-writing committees, which have been busy drafting trade legislation, have yet to focus on the full range of excise tax options, from airline tickets to truck tires, and perhaps even alternatives outside the excise-tax sphere should the debate bog down.

Adjustment Process Seen **********''There was panic, but there wasn't chaos,'' said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. ''With the stock market as earnings leveraged as it has been lately, you have to expect a much more speculative and volatile environment, especially since interest rates are no longer a supportive factor.'' **********''I think the market is going through an adjustment process where stocks will sink or swim based on the merits of their earnings results,'' he added. **********The stock market's tone had its roots in the bond market, where prices of Treasury issues declined because of worries over higher interest rates. **********The chief concern of bond traders was that higher rates in West Germany would prompt the Federal Reserve Board to tighten credit to maintain the attractiveness of the dollar, which dropped on foreign exchange markets yesterday. Stock investors, in turn, feared resulting interest rate increases would cut into corporate profits. There were also concerns that higher yields would make some bonds a more attractive investment than stocks. **********As the session progressed, bond prices improved, particularly in the final hour of trading, but the stock market's decline accelerated. **********Mr. Peroni, who noted that turnover on the Big Board was mild by recent standards, said yesterday's activity also reflected the market's sensitivity to external impulses, such as comments made by Robert Prechter, the influential technical analyst. **********Early in the day, brokers noted, Mr. Prechter had made bearish comments about the stock market, suggesting a steep decline was possible. Mr. Prechter said that the failure of the Dow to pierce 2,640 would lead to a move to the 2,300 area in the next few weeks. **********Yesterday's trading, however, did not indicate a flood of portfolio adjustments. Just 175.6 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, up modestly from 159.7 million shares traded on Monday. **********Robert E. Walsh, a money manager at Jenswold, King & Associates in Houston, pointed out that the bulk of the decline in the 30-stock Dow was caused by six issues in the average that consititute 41 percent of its value. **********Yesterday, I.B.M. lost 5 1/2 points, to 151; Merck 7, to 201; Philip Morris 4, to 113 1/2; Kodak 2 3/4, to 101 3/8; Procter & Gamble 4, to 99 1/2, and Du Pont 4 1/2, to 118 1/2. **********''We don't view this as the end of the bull market and we're cautioning investors to keep today's decline in persective,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''Market breadth, while decidely weak, was not at record proportions either, as the net difference of advancing to declining isssues was less than 1,000, which is well below 1,200 to 1,300 figures of recent times.'' Effect of Interest Rates **********Richard Schmidt, director of research at the Advest Group in Hartford, said interest rates would be a contributing factor for the stocks of companies whose earnings are weaker. ''Those companies with the potential to show earnings well above the average will make it,'' he said. ''The average stock, on the other hand, will face some downside risk.'' **********And J. Warren Hall, senior vice president of funds management at the National City Corporation in Cleveland, said: ''We think the stock market is sounding a false alarm. The trade balance is improving and inflation is under satisfactory control. At 10 percent, the long bond is now attractive and stocks should do well in a bond market rally.'' **********Yesterday, broader-based averages than the Dow also were hit hard. The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 4.46 points, to 178.98, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 8.86, to 319.22. Chemical Stocks Down **********Recently strong groups were among the hardest-hit industrial sectors. Among the chemical stocks, Dow Chemical was down 1 3/8, to 107 7/8; Union Cabide 1 5/8, to 30 1/2, and National Distillers 1 5/8, to 85 7/8. **********In the high-technology area, Digital Equipment dropped 3 3/4, to 194; National Semiconductor 1 3/8, to 20 5/8; Cray Research 2 3/4, to 95; Motorola 2 1/8, to 70 5/8, and Compaq dropped 2 7/8, to 75 3/8. **********Several takeover-related stocks bucked yesterday's trend. **********Tenneco led the Big Board's most-active list rising 1 3/8, to 61 1/4. A Wall Street Journal column stirred speculation that Tenneco might be a takeover target. Gillette rose 1 3/8, to 43 5/8, on rumors that someone other than Revlon might be accumulating stock in the company. **********USG, formerly United States Gypsum, rose 3 1/4, to 54 7/8. On Monday, two Texas investors disclosed they might seek control of USG. **********On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex-market value index fell 3.89 points, to 355.44, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index declined 6.12 points, to 447.51."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/world/palestinian-riots-hit-jerusalem-banks-attacked-and-roads-seized.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1987-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 995, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Palestinian Riots Hit Jerusalem; Banks Attacked and Roads Seized", "print_headline": "Palestinian Riots Hit Jerusalem; Banks Attacked and Roads Seized", "body_text": " **********Palestinian rioting spread to Jerusalem today, with crowds of rock-throwing youths attacking Israeli-owned banks and taking over the streets of the Arab district for hours. **********Police officials said it was the worst violence here in more than a decade. **********In the extraordinary 11th straight day of violent protests in the Israeli-occupied territories, the focus shifted from the Gaza Strip, which appeared mostly quiet but tense under tight army control, to areas of the Israeli capital captured in the 1967 war. Burning Tires and Barricades **********Crowds of teen-agers poured out of their schools shortly after eight o'clock this morning, heading for Salah e-Din Street, the main commercial artery in Arab East Jerusalem, where they set tires afire and threw up barricades of old furniture, garbage bins, bus stop signs ripped out of the ground and, in one case, a car pushed into the street. **********As police officers firing tear gas chased them, the groups ran and reformed, with the skirmishes continuing until mid-afternoon. **********''This is serious,'' said Police Inspector Gen. David Kraus. ''It seems this was organized through the schools. **********''We used all means at our disposal - tear gas, water cannons, batons - to break up the riots, but no live ammunition,'' he said. Eighteen Palestinians have been killed in the riots, most shot by Israeli security forces. Concern to Tourism Officials **********With Christmas approaching, the possibility that the unrest could continue and spread was causing concern to security and tourism officials. Bethlehem, revered by Christians as the birthplace of Christ, is in the occupied West Bank; other Christian holy sites are in Arab districts. **********There were anti-Israeli demonstrations in Bethlehem, near the Church of the Nativity, and in Hebron, Nablus and Ramallah, other West Bank towns. In some places, stones were thrown at Israeli troops. Several thousand Israeli Arabs also demonstrated in Nazareth, and in Mishkenot Haroim, one of the new Jewish settlements south of Jerusalem that have been built near Arab villages, a restaurant owned by Jews was set afire. Curfews for Refugees **********The Army reinstated around-the-clock curfews today in the West Bank refugee districts of Balata and Askar, after having lifted them briefly. **********Arabs living inside Israel's pre-1967 borders have called for a general strike Monday in support of the Arabs in the occupied territories. The 800,000 Arabs in Israel hold Israeli citizenship and may vote but, with a few exceptions, cannot serve in the Israeli armed forces. **********Israeli-owned banks in the Arab sector appeared to be particular targets in today's rioting. Windows were smashed at four of the five branch offices of Israeli-operated banks in East Jerusalem, and records were destroyed in at least one. Bank Office Wrecked **********At the Bank Leumi branch on Salah e-Din Street, the two big plate glass windows, cobwebbed with the impact of rocks, were pushed in from their frames and the office, guarded at nightfall by two Israelis with automatic rifles, appeared wrecked. **********In Barclay's Discount Bank the computers were smashed, records destroyed and checks and other papers ripped and scattered about. **********The Jerusalem city authorities also appeared to be a target; bright yellow municipal vans were stoned and city cars set afire and destroyed. Police and army cars were also stoned. **********The rock-throwing demonstrators included teen-age girls in their school uniforms. Some youths wore gloves to pick up the tear gas canisters and hurl them back at the police. Called 'Very Serious' **********Palestinians in Jerusalem have been particularly angered because Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, the architect of the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, has just taken an apartment near the Damascus Gate in the traditionally Arab Moslem quarter of the old city. **********''This is very serious and more than I expected,'' said Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem. ''It's hard to measure the extent to which Sharon moving into the Moslem quarter is responsible. **********''Mostly it's what's happening in the territories, but in a situation like this, any match can light a fire and Sharon's entrance into the Moslem quarter was more than a match,'' the Mayor added. **********Police officials said it was the most serious unrest in the city since Palestinian protests in 1976, in which four people were killed. #33 Arrested During Day The police said 19 minors and 14 adults were arrested during the day. Four policemen were wounded by rocks and two others were wounded when their car struck a tree as it was being stoned. **********By late afternoon, the smell of burning rubber and tear gas hung in the air as soldiers and the border police patrolled the streets of East Jerusalem. **********Merchants on Salah e-Din Street -named for the Arab hero, Saladin, who took Jerusalem from the Crusaders 800 years ago - had just opened their shops for the first time after a general strike called on Tuesday. They hastily pulled their steel shutters down again. **********Only a few blocks away, in Jewish areas of West Jerusalem, it was a normal Sabbath. Protests by Orthodox **********Indeed, it was so normal that rigorously Orthodox Jews continued their weekly protests against the showing of movies on the Sabbath. The police said an army officer was injured when orthodox militants stoned his car. **********The state radio reported that the Israeli Supreme Court had ordered an inquiry into the death of a Palestinian youth who was said to have stabbed a soldier. **********The radio quoted witnesses as saying the youth, Atweh Abu Samahadna, was shot in the leg after slightly wounding the soldier and taken to an Israeli hospital.

An Example of Agency Role **********The Fed chairman said that such an agency could act as a major clearinghouse for coordinated regulation as the various components of the financial system become more similar in the services and products they offer.

Rather, he appeared to recommend a more limited role, so the agency would function primarily as a forum for regulators to coordinate equitable existing regulations. **********His endorsement, expressed for the first time today, gives impetus to the concept, but final approval is still in doubt. For one thing, the concept would effectively take away authority from existing Federal agencies, which might object. Support for Proxmire-Garn **********Mr. Greenspan also reiterated his support today for a bill that would repeal major portions of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which separates commercial and investment banking. He urged the Senate Banking Committee to approve legislation sponsored by Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, and Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, that would permit banks to underwrite corporate securities and permit securities firms not associated with insurance or real estate businesses to own and operate a commercial bank. **********In addition today, Senators Alfonse M.

New, Harder Questions **********When the church was weaker and its priests were being persecuted, it did not have to deal with questions like these: *********** Should the church retreat further from the social activism of the Solidarity period, when it shielded believers and nonbelievers challenging the Communist state? *********** Should it bestow even limited blessing on the policies of Poland's leaders and risk being accused of collaboration? *********** Should it urge Polish workers to work harder for less money? *********** Should it curb its most aggressively anti-Communist priests in the hope of expanding Vatican influence beyond Polish borders to the Soviet Union and Soviet bloc countries? **********For decades, perhaps even centuries, the Polish church saw itself as the good son, who, in the parable cited in Luke, was less warmly appreciated by his father than his prodigal brother. **********Like the good son, the Polish church was loyal, constant, pious and dutiful. Yet it felt itself to be less cherished in Rome than the Italian, French, Irish or American churches. It had a tendency to parochial isolation and its martyrs were more contemporary than those of other churches. **********With the ascension of the then Archbishop of Cracow to the throne of St. Peter, that self-image changed, and the Polish church grew more assertive at home and in the world. A Growing Clergy **********The clergy is growing here. There are now more Roman Catholic seminarians in Poland than in any country in the world. A third of all newly ordained European priests are Poles. More churches are being built in Poland than in the rest of Europe. Mass is broadcast weekly on the state radio. Catholic-sponsored newspapers reach two million families. Most children attend catechism classes. **********''We have virtually attained full freedom of worship,'' said Bishop Jerzy Dabrowski of Warsaw. **********The Rev. Antoni Pominski, editor of a church newspaper in Woclawek, said, ''If someone predicted 10 years ago that the church would have gained so much so soon, I would have thought him mad.'' **********Krzysztof Sliwinski, a writer for liberal Catholic journals who was associated with the now outlawed Solidarity labor union, said, ''Sometimes, I think there are elements in our church that are now almost indecently triumphant.'' **********Just as the elevation of Karol Wojtyla to the papacy inspired the Polish nation, so the rise of Solidarity and its protection by at least part of the clergy further enhanced the church's influence. For centuries, the church defended national interests against real and would-be occupiers and their local cat's-paws. **********The church also prospered after the suppression of Solidarity, when it remained the last refuge and resort of opposition. **********''The church was strong before Solidarity,'' Jozef Cardinal Glemp, the Polish Primate, said in an interview shortly after thousands of Solidarity activists were interned in 1981. ''It got stronger during Solidarity, and it gained again in strength under martial law. It seems that whatever happens in Poland - whatever else it does -strengthens the church.'' From Strength Come Problems **********But with the strength come problems. ''Society has projected its hopes and aspirations on the church and now society expects too much from us,'' Bishop Dabrowski said.  As Solidarity declined, he said, some of its supporters have looked increasingly to the church to take up the struggle for social justice, human rights and broader liberties. At the same time, the Government has sought to cajole the church into giving its blessing to Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's professed policies of normalization and economic change. **********Many inside and outside the church say they believe that the Pope's visit and planned meeting with Lech Walesa, the founder of Solidarity, and scheduled discussions with women workers in Lodz will communicate his respect for the ideals of Solidarity. **********But there is a general expectation that the visit will mark a transition from a time when many priests could openly identify with the labor unions as a vehicle for national revival and independence. A Nonpolitical Emphasis **********The Pope is to pray at the grave of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the pro-Solidarity priest murdered by the secret police. But the event is listed as private. Similarly, parish priests are asking people not to bring political placards to observances or to make the ''V'' hand signs for Solidarity. **********Some Poles are asking how much autonomy the church needs before it is prepared to undertake programs of social action. As one liberal Catholic asked over dinner recently, ''How many state authorizations to build churches have to be given before the church authorities can feel bold enough to start demanding the right to organize hospitals, nursing schools, their own high schools or independent associations of Catholic workers?'' **********Though there is a marked hesitancy on the part of some in the hierarchy for institutional broadening of church involvement in social services, the episcopate has in general terms endorsed a course of social activism. A Variety of Strategies **********As explained by several church leaders, the Polish church, chafing under the restraints of once aggressively atheistic Communism, had these possible strategies: *********** It could, as Poland's leaders once hoped, confine itself to purely religious life, officiating at ceremonies and maintaining church buildings and cemeteries. *********** Or it could, in theory, seek to support or initiate small political groupings as embryonic Christian democratic parties that would take part in the limited parliamentary politics tolerated in a country where the Communist Party, by definition, has the deciding role. **********Though both these concepts have their proponents in the church, they have been rejected by the Polish bishops, who instead have claimed the right of the church to involve itself fully in the social and moral life of the nation. **********In the aftermath of Solidarity's rise, some priests saw the nonviolent movement as a re-enactment of 19th century Polish uprisings against occupation forces, which priests joined and blessed. First Visit Inspired Nation **********There are historians and political observers who believe that it was the patriotic aspects of the Pope's first visit in 1979 that generated the jubilation and euphoria that led to the rise of Solidarity. **********When he returned for his second visit, the Pope was clearly sorrowed by martial law and he pressed for release of political prisoners and a national reconciliation. **********Now, on the eve of his third visit, there are no political prisoners, and large parts of Polish society are worn down by the raising and dashing of hope. **********In this atmosphere, church leaders are expecting that the Pope will be stressing personal sacrifice and individual religious and moral transformation rather than a prospect of miraculous or eruptive national redemption. **********''I have a feeling that all of us Poles have failed his hopes and wishes for us,'' said Father Pominski, the editor in Woclawek. ''He came and too many of us thought that things would change by miracle. In the first two visits, we all saw him as ours, a Polish pope, but now I think he is coming as the the world's pope, and I have a feeling he will try to reach each of us deeply in a spiritual way.'' **********Some priests have predicted that the Pope will focus on alcoholism, divorce and abortion. Both in the church and in Polish society there is a significantly widespread view of ''the good Pope'' and ''the bad Primate.'' **********Asked about this, Bishop Dabrowski the Primate's counselor, smiled and said, ''The Pope, speaking with universal authority, inspires with his vision, while the Primate has to pull us back and restrain us from unrealistic aspirations.'' **********Others said Cardinal Glemp was also concerned with strengthening church institutions in preparation for the day when a Pole would no longer be Pope."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/17/business/business-digest-saturday-october-17-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 714, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST SATURDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1987", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST SATURDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1987", "body_text": " **********Markets **********Stock prices collapsed in a broad selloff, with the Dow Jones industrial average suffering its first daily loss of more than 100 points.

Only four months ago, Pan Am was holding talks with American Airlines on being taken over and was seeking to sell its shuttle that links Boston, New York and Washington. Now it is seeking to hold onto its assets and even expand them to take advantage of the travel upturn. **********It is in the midst of negotiations with Citicorp, for example, to renew the leases on three Boeing 747's so it can add capacity to handle the heavier demand from customers. **********The carrier, however, could become vulnerable again if terrorist attacks send traffic plunging as happened last year. And its cash reserves are smaller than last year, when it had close to $1 billion, mostly from the sale of its Pacific routes to United Airlines. The current cash reserve is only $150 million. **********Several positive trends have emerged to bolster the carrier's prospects. Pan Am was able to negotiate a lower pay scale for new pilots with the pilots' union last month and has hired about 50 out of a projected 150 pilots to enable it operate its shuttle and its expanded international summer flights. This is the first hiring of pilots by the company in 19 years. **********The lower scale, combined with the delivery of six of the two-engine, fuel-efficient Airbus A310-300 airplanes in June, will enable Pan Am to cut the operating costs of its aged fleet. The Airbus planes can operate with a crew of two, instead of the three on Pan Am's present planes. **********The new capacity is expected to come when Pan Am will be eager for planes to carry the heavy traffic that has been building since March. **********C. Edward Acker, chairman and chief executive of the Pan American Corporation, the holding company, said in an interview yesterday that, while the carrier had expected a recovery in traffic from last year, when terrorist attacks sent traffic plunging by more than 30 percent, the demand this year had been better than expected. ''There is a surge that hit about the middle of March,'' Mr. Acker said. ''Things have really remained strong.'' **********He said that the load factor, which measures how full planes are, was about 63 percent for the airline in April, up from 60 percent in a normal year. **********''It's strong all over,'' he added, ''not only in the North Atlantic but in Latin America as well.'' Pan Am said its travel to Europe in April rose 40 percent from April 1986, with Latin American volume gaining 23 percent. **********Helane Becker, an airline analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert, said that, if traffic continued strong during the summer, Mr. Acker's projections that the airline would break even were realistic. **********She noted that travelers to Europe had tended to book their trips later and to stay for shorter periods to compensate for the weaker dollar. The shorter durations are a boon to the large international carriers, she said, since, with fewer deep-discount fares available, more people travel at higher fares. **********Revenues were up an estimated 13 percent in the first quarter, according to Mr. Acker. Pan Am expects to release its first-quarter results this week, and Mr. Acker said that the loss would be smaller than the $118 million reported in last year's first quarter. **********Pan Am suffered last year when terrorist attacks in Europe kept American tourists at home. The company's losses totaled $462.8 million last year. **********Pan Am is seeking to build up its reserves further against an unexpected jolt. Citicorp has provided the carrier with a line of credit for $75 million and is seeking to line up $75 million more with other banks that would get backing for the loans in the form of Pan Am engines and spare parts. **********Mr. Acker also said that, to make the carrier viable for the long term, it needs $180 million in concessions from its three unions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/19/business/dutch-options-trading.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dutch Options Trading", "print_headline": "Dutch Options Trading", "body_text": " **********The European Options Exchange today introduced a stock index options contract based on an index of 20 major Dutch shares for which options are already traded individually on the exchange.

That is a signal that the entire group - after languishing in the doldrums for more than two years - might be on the brink of a turnaround. **********''The famine in fast-food stocks may be over,'' said Glenn Johnson, restaurant analyst for Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. ''There's a trend in Wall Street toward raising earnings estimates on certain restaurant stocks - the first time that's happened in a long while.'' Like other analysts, he noted that stock prices have not yet reflected this new optimism. **********Berton Seltzberg, an analyst at the Advest Group in Hartford, cautioned, however, that the fast-food industry ''continues to be beset by over-saturation of certain food segments, such as chicken or hamburgers, a downturn in same-store customer counts, a saturation in certain geographical areas such as the Northeast and Midwest, and - among the higher-end restaurants - the poor economies of 'oil patch U.S.A.' '' **********He said he was not looking for a recovery of the entire group until the beginning of next year, but he does have his favorites now. He sees Piccadilly Cafeterias Inc. as a good turnaround situation. Piccadilly, one of the largest publicly traded cafeteria chains, carries a lower multiple than many of its competitors, about 10.3 times projected 1988 earnings, according to its close yesterday of $16.50 a share in over-the-counter trading. **********The Baton Rouge, La., company earned 97 cents a share in the fiscal year ended June 30, down from $1.30 in the 1986 fiscal year. However, Mr. Seltzberg is projecting earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.60 in 1988, rising to $1.85 to $1.90 in fiscal 1989. **********''Piccadilly should build better profit margins as it expands the number of its units by 8 to 10 percent annually,'' he said. **********Mr. Johnson's current favorite is Buffets Inc., a small, fast-growing chain based in Wayzata, Minn., that specializes in buffet-style dining. He thinks the company will double its earnings this year while most of the rest of the fast-food industry continues to consolidate. He is looking for earnings of 50 cents a share at Buffets in 1987, up from 24 cents in 1986, and he has raised his 1988 per-share estimate to 75 cents. ''The company offers quality, nutritious food at low prices, which is what the public is turned on to these days,'' he said. Buffets, which trades over-the-counter, closed yesterday at $21 a share, at a rather high multiple, 28 times estimated 1988 earnings. **********Mr. Johnson also is recommending International Dairy Queen of Minneapolis, which has maintained a steady 15 percent annual earnings growth rate. ''The company earned $1.25 a share in fiscal 1986, will do $1.50 a share this year and should make $1.90 a share in fiscal 1988,'' he said. The stock closed yesterday at $32 a share. **********Roger Lipton, managing director of Lipton Research, the restaurant research arm of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, said that, while the industry environment was not one of ebullience, the rampant building by start-up companies had abated and the shake-out in the group was largely completed. **********''I favor small companies such as Bombay Palace Restaurants and USACafes,'' he added. ''Although these companies are not generally in favor, I have a strong conviction that inefficiencies in the market allow for some unusual opportunities.'' **********Bombay Palace is a chain of urban ethnic dinner houses, including Indian, Mexican and Caribbean cuisines. Mr. Lipton said Bombay Palace, excluding the pending acquisition of Lifestyle Restaurants, should earn more than 50 cents a share in 1987 and 70 cents a share in 1988. ''The combined company should earn more than $1 a share in 1988 and as much as $1.50 a share in 1989,'' he added. ''At $7 a share, Bombay Palace stock is cheap, whatever the general market environment for small stocks.'' The stock closed at $6.75 yesterday in Nasdaq trading. **********John Hunt, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, is particularly bullish on Shoney's Inc., a Nashville-based operator and franchiser of restaurants, primarily in the Eastern United States. ''On a relative basis, the company's shares are selling near their lowest point since 1980,'' Mr. Hunt said. He added that, despite soft store sales primarily related to sluggish industry conditions, the management of Shoney's would be able to maintain earnings momentum. **********''We expect earnings per share to increase 17 percent, to $1.35, in fiscal 1987 and 26 percent, to $1.70, in fiscal 1988,'' he said, noting that earnings growth over the next five years could rise at about 15 percent a year, based primarily on a 10 percent growth in new units of Shoney's and its Captain D's ''fast'' seafood chain, as well as a 4 to 5 percent growth in sales per unit. **********Although most of these experts currently are focusing on smaller-capitalized restaurant issues, the perennial giants of the industry, McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, and the like, cannot be ignored. The Pershing division of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette notes in a recent report that these issues continue to dominate the fast-food scene. ''The stronger chains have benefited by acquiring failed units of the weaker operators - often at bargain prices,'' it said. **********''Wendy's is the only one of the three big chains that I would currently recommend because I think they will aggressively roll out their new expanded salad bar, including Mexican and pasta items,'' said Mr. Lipton of Lipton Research. ''By spring of 1988, the expanded salad bar will be system-wide in their 900 company-operated stores.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/19/business/utah-oil-refinery-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Utah Oil Refinery Plan", "print_headline": "Utah Oil Refinery Plan", "body_text": " **********Officials of the United States Petroleum Corporation have announced plans to build a $100 million oil products refinery here.

Rickert dips a sterile glass plate into a tub of water. Across the surface of the water, like soap spread across a pool, is a thin membrane one molecule in thickness that adheres to the plate's surface. **********Although the ultra-thin films are being created by a decades-old technology, they are being viewed by Dr. Rickert and other chemical engineers in very new ways that promise important breakthroughs in computer and other technologies. **********Above all, the thin film allows scientists to cram many more transistors, diodes and capacitors onto silicon wafers, a development that could make computers far more powerful and faster. **********The films being created by Dr. Rickert and his team are made from organic, carbon-based molecules that contain metallic atoms. When the film dries and the molecules crystallize, the metallic atoms line up in a precise geometric pattern that conducts electricity. The carbon acts as an insulator. **********The one-molecule-thick films can process information thousands of times faster than conventional silicon chips because they create less resistance to the flow of electricity and because the circuits can be packed more closely together. **********In all, the process is similar to the flow of electrical impulses in nerve tissue or the transport of electrons in photosynthesis, the basic life process in which carbon dioxide is converted into organic material. As a result, some scientists predict that chips made from thin film will hasten the day when computer operations will more closely mimic the biochemical processes of the brain. **********''With this technology microelectronics is merging with organic chemistry and biology,'' said Dr. Rickert, a chemical engineer and one of the country's top thin-film researchers. He predicted that the first experimental computers made solely from thin-film chips would be available in five to ten years. **********Until recently America's only serious competitor in the field was Japan, but because of the huge commercial potential of thin film, other countries, including Britain, France and West Germany, have entered the fray. **********The race is heating up because the potential benefits of thin films are not limited to computer-related technology. Dr. Rickert, for example, is using thin films as sensors. The special electrical behavior, he said, makes various thin films extremely sensitive to changes in humidity, temperature, pressure, the presence of chemicals or other environmental factors. **********Dr. Rickert quantifies the changes by measuring the time it takes electricity to pass through films under different environmental conditions. By attaching the films to integrated circuits, he has developed sensors that can instantaneously measure the presence of ammonia, oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases at concentrations as low as 5 parts per billion. A conventional meter would take 20 minutes or more to do it. **********The Defense Department, which is financing most of Dr. Rickert's work, is interested in developing sensor devices that soldiers could wear on their wrists to detect poison gases. **********In another application of thin films, Dr. Rickert helped to develop a process for making more complex and faster conventional silicon chips.  * * * **********The dipping technique used to produce thin film was discovered more than 65 years ago by Irving Langmuir and Katherine Blodgett, chemists at the General Electric Company in Schenectady, N.Y. Even though it helped Dr. Langmuir win a Nobel Prize in 1931, the development gained little attention over the next five decades as plastics and composites dominated the field of chemical engineering. In the early 1980's, though, as the space squeeze on silicon chips became more severe, chemical engineers like Dr. Rickert rediscovered Langmuir-Blodgett films. **********Conventional computer chips process information by alternately allowing, then blocking, the flow of electronic impulses carried on wires and switches imbedded in the silicon. The faster the electronic stream is switched off and on, the more information that can be processed and the more powerful the silicon chip. **********A principal rule in making chips is that elements on the chips, such as wires or transistors, can be no closer than the thickness of the surface of the chip, otherwise it will short-circuit. Conventional chips are made using films that are usually one micron thick, or about 100 times the thickness of the thin-film chips. **********Using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, a special polymer that is light-sensitive is placed across a chromium surface. The polymer - a substance composed of giant molecules formed from smaller ones - is then exposed to microscopic beams of light that trace the grid design of the chip and cause chemical changes within the polymer that turn the microscopic lines red. **********The chip is then dipped into a series of solvents. The first dissolves the polymer that was not exposed to light, and leaves the chromium base and the red lines intact. The second dissolves all the chromium except for what lies beneath the red lines. The third dissolves the red lines, leaving chromium lines. **********Engineers call the final product a ''mask.'' By projecting light through it and onto silicon wafers, masks serve as templates for manufacturing computer chips."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/06/business/dow-jumps-another-18.98-to-2276.43.html": {"writer_name": "John Crudele", "pub_date": "1987-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 679, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DOW JUMPS ANOTHER 18.98, TO 2,276.43", "print_headline": "DOW JUMPS ANOTHER 18.98, TO 2,276.43", "body_text": " **********The stock market advanced further into uncharted territory yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average scoring another big gain that moved it closer to the 2,300 level. **********With yesterday's increase of 18.98 points, to a high of 2,276.43, the 30-stock Dow average has now closed at record levels in 23 of the first 43 trading sessions this year.

Baker 3d struck a compromise with the chairmen of the Senate and House Banking Committees this afternoon that should avoid a threatened Presidential veto of important banking legislation, Congressional sources said. **********The compromise greatly increases the chances that the most far-reaching banking legislation in seven years will be signed into law by early next month. **********After two meetings on Capitol Hill today with the Treasury Secretary, Representative Fernand J. St Germain, Democrat from Rhode Island, and Senator William Proxmire, Democrat from Wisconsin, agreed to three modifications to the banking bill that was passed by House and Senate conferees earlier this month. In exchange, the Treasury Secretary said he would urge President Reagan to sign the legislation. **********''It's as close to a done deal as you can get,'' one lobbyist said.

White House Position **********Not only did the White House and Treasury contend that the $8.5 billion rescue package of the F.S.L.I.C. was far too small, but other provisions of the bill that place a moratorium on giving commercial banks new underwriting powers and a ban on the further creation of limited-service banks represented a significant setback to the Reagan policy of deregulation. **********Yet, a combination of concern about possible runs by depositors at weak thrift institutions in Texas and the strong likelihood that any Reagan veto would be overridden in the Senate apparentaly led the Treasury to compromise. **********''I think they finally realized that the President's veto simply could not have been sustained, and that brought the Treasury to the bargaining table,'' one lobbyist said. **********Mr. Baker met in the morning with Senator Proxmire and again in the afternoon with Mr. Proxmire, Mr. St Germain and their top aides. Treasury Under Secretary George D. Gould, the key architect of the Treasury banking effort, was also at the afternoon meeting. $15 Billion First Sought The Treasury had at first asked for a $15 billion rescue package of the insurance agency, then began trying to get $12 billion in new funds. Mr. Baker and Mr. Gould finally settled for $10 billion, plus an additional $825 million that represents exhausted assets that thrift institutions had on deposit at the insurance agency. **********The rescue plan is essentially a program that will permit the insurance agency to borrow the $10.8 billion from the public, in the form of goverment-backed bonds, and use the money to shut down hundreds of sick thrift units. The fund is now more than $6 billion in the red, according to some estimates. **********The Administration also strongly objected to the so-called forbearance provisions for troubled thrift institutions, mandated in the conferee-passed bill. Those measures created a lenient regulatory atmosphere and permitted a thrift institution in an economically depressed region, such as Texas, to continue to operate for a period of years even if its net worth fell dangerously close to zero. Regulators complained that such provisions would have made it nearly impossible to supervise and impose discipline properly on such institutions. **********In the compromise worked out today, the regulatory leniency would end after about three years. **********The Administration also had problems with the ban in the bill on new limited-service banks, which it sees as healthy competitors to commercial banks. The bill also severely restricted the activities and growth of the 168 existing limited-service banks. **********Though Senator Proxmire and Mr. St Germain did not compromise on the issue of creating any more limited-service banks, they did permit the existing concerns somewhat more operating abilities, provided they acquire a failed savings and loan association of $500 million or more. The compromise also permits any other financial or commercial enterprise, such as an insurance company or brokerage firm, to buy one or more of these sick institutions. **********Dozens of insolvent thrift institutions exist, and not enough healthy thrift units have come forward to buy them. The compromise is aimed at finding new buyers outside the thrift industry. **********Congressional sources said that the 32 conferees would be solicited this evening and tomorrow morning for their support for the compromise."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/26/business/company-news-amc-expects-to-give-bonuses.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.M.C.

Mr. Ferris spoke of getting the allegiance of travelers and providing protection for them. **********''UAL was thought by many to simply mean United Airlines,'' he said. ''We are a travel company, not just a transportation company.'' **********UAL used an ''identity management consultant,'' Lippincott & Marguelies, and ultimately narrowed its choices to four words. Mr. Ferris said that one of the finalists was ''Covia,'' a name the company decided to adopt for its Apollo Travel Services subsidiary. $7.3 Million for Advertising UAL is starting a $7.3 million advertising campaign to spread the word about its new name - one of many new names that American corporations have chosen in recent years with the aid of name-finding companies and computers that throw out mellifluous sounding words not found in the Oxford English Dictionary.

Today more than 800 publishers vie for business in a $3.6 billion-a-year industry - and the noteworthy event might be a divorce or a promotion, the death of a dog or an unhappy 40th birthday. **********But while the diversity means more choice for consumers, manufacturers are finding the industry tougher and more competitive than ever before. Americans bought more than 7 billion cards last year, but growth in the last two years has been minimal. Unit volume has increased less than 5 percent in each of those years, and analysts do not expect much improvement in the next few years. Baby boomers, who fueled industry surges in the late 1970's and early 1980's, are continuing to buy cards - but no more than they did last year or the year before. **********''Demographics are working against card makers right now,'' said E. Gray Glass, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities. **********What spurred the growth during the 1970's and 1980's was a phenomenon that the industry called alternative greeting cards. They featured contemporary graphics, biting sarcasm and a tendency toward the risque - and baby boomers loved them. And, indeed, the alternative card market is still growing by 15 to 20 percent a year, and now accounts for nearly half of the overall card business, according to the Washington-based Greeting Card Association. **********The alternative card market has become so attractive, in fact, that the industry's Big Three - Hallmark, American Greetings and Gibson Greetings - have, in the last two years, started to move onto the turf once dominated by small companies. Fighting back, many small companies are trying to gain a foothold in the retail outlets that have for years been dominated by the giants. **********''What's happening is a crossover in turfs of large and small companies,'' said Hy Mariampolsky of Qualidata, a New York research firm that follows the industry. ''The larger companies have gone after the customers previously served by small alternative companies. The small companies, meanwhile, are trying to get on the shelves of supermarkets and drugstore chains.'' **********Supermarkets and drugstore chains are, indeed, the fiercest battlegrounds in the greeting card skirmish. ''Distribution has shifted in the last few years to the mass merchants,'' said Ed Fruchtenbaum, vice president of marketing at American Greetings. ''People have less time to shop so they're buying everything, including greeting cards, in the same stores.'' **********The battle for shelf space has been costly for all manufacturers. American Greetings, which controls 35 percent of the American greeting card market, and Gibson Greetings, which has just under a 10 percent share, both saw their earnings decline last year. (Privately held Hallmark, which controls an estimated 40 percent of the market, does not disclose financial information.) The strain on earnings is due largely to the stiff competition, which is prompting manufacturers to offer retailers greater discounts -60 percent and up, compared with the traditional 50 percent - and more services, particularly return privileges on cards that do not sell. Competition has also held average card prices steady at the $1 mark during the last two years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/24/world/burundi-leader-attempts-east-west-balance.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1987-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1026, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Burundi Leader Attempts East-West Balance", "print_headline": "Burundi Leader Attempts East-West Balance", "body_text": " **********After Maj. Pierre Buyoya seized power two weeks ago in this central African land, he moved to ease Government repression against the Roman Catholic Church, announced the release of at least 200 political prisoners and promised more democracy. **********The moves came as a balm to many Burundians, who had seen the tiny landlocked country evolve into what some described as a virtual dictatorship under the leadership of the former ruler, Jean-Baptiste Bagaza. People in Bujumbura, the drowsy capital, where there is scant military presence, speak of a sense of relief. **********''We will now be allowed to go to the President and discuss problems,'' said Marius Rurahenye, general secretary of the Burundi Workers' Union and a former member of the country's Central Committee. ''Bagaza often went and talked to groups, but what he said was very different from what he did. That was not genuine dialogue.'' But while there appears to be widespread acceptance of the new military regime, some Burundians and Western diplomats say it is too early to assess whether a change in leadership will soon translate into dramatic changes in Government policy. Tutsi and Hutu Tensions **********A true test, they say, will be whether Mr. Buyoya moves to modify the balance of power between Burundi's dominant ethnic minority, the Tutsi, and the ethnic Hutu majority, which has long been politically and economically subservient. **********Mr. Buyoya, 38 years old, is ruling the country as head of a so-called Military Committee of National Redemption. He has charged that his predecessor put too much power into his own hands, violated the Constitution and fostered an incoherent economic policy. **********Western diplomats and Burundians say Mr. Buyoya often disagreed with Mr. Bagaza, who was toppled while he was attending a conference in Canada. He is now in Uganda.  The new leader, a Belgian-educated soldier who also took courses in France and West Germany, is said to be highly popular among younger army officers and to have a reserved demeanor. More Balance in Outside Ties **********Mr. Buyoya is expected to maintain the country's official policy of nonalignment, while more evenly balancing links with the West and Burundi's close ties to Libya and the Eastern bloc. **********Although Mr. Buyoya denounced the former Government's economic policy, diplomats here said they expected him to continue a program of economic liberalization in what is one of the world's poorest countries. **********In a radio address to the nation soon after seizing power, Mr. Buyoya, a Roman Catholic, pledged to respect freedom of worship. The statement suggested a more conciliatory approach to the Roman Catholic Church in Burundi, the population of which is 65 percent Catholic. **********His predecessor expelled most Catholic missionaries from the country, banned church lay organizations and permitted priests to offer mass only on weekends. **********Some people suggest that the takeover Sept. 3 was little more than a palace uprising by the same group of military officers who helped put Mr. Bagaza in power in a bloodless army coup in 1976. 'It Is the Same Group' **********Like his predecessor, Mr. Buyoya is a Tutsi, a group that makes up 15 percent of the country's five million people but which has long dominated the Hutus, who make up most of the rest of the population. **********''It is the same group, the same army, the same Tutsi minority,'' a Western diplomat said, although he added that Mr. Buyoya's initial political moves had been ''very positive.'' **********''We had to take a wait-and-see attitude,'' the diplomat said, ''but if the new Government had not intended to modify the positions of the past, I don't think we would have seen these initial steps.'' **********Mr. Bagaza, 41 years old, had been regarded as a peacemaker in one of Africa's most bitter tribal conflicts. That conflict had erupted in 1972, when Tutsi policemen and members of the party's youth group killed about 150,000 Hutus after Hutus killed several thousand Tutsis in an unsuccessful bid for majority rule. **********Despite his attempts at reconciliation, when Mr. Bagaza was deposed three-quarters of his Cabinet, three-quarters of the National Assembly, about two-thirds of the university students, 13 of 15 provincial governors, all the army officers and 96 percent of the enlisted soldiers were Tutsi. Dispute on Identifying Students **********And despite the Bagaza Government's denials of ethnic discrimination, human-rights groups earlier this year accused the former rulers of imprisoning a group of Hutu intellectuals after the leak of an official Government letter that was sent to some primary-school principals. **********In the letter, the principals were said to have been asked to provide lists of students that indicated Tutsis with an ''I'' and Hutus with a ''U.'' **********President Buyoya, who has dismissed all members of the former Government, the ruling party and the country's Judicial Council, has insisted that ''all sections of the public'' will be included in making decisions. **********But some diplomats and others say it will not be easy to improve the complex ethnic situation. The Tutsis, descendants of herdsmen from northern Africa, have for centuries held sway over the Hutus, who are generally peasant farmers of southern African Bantu stock. 'Profound Changes' Coming **********More than 70 years of German and Belgian colonial rule did little to change the situation. Since independence in 1962, every Government has been dominated by Tutsis. **********In a recent interview with Agence France-Presse, Mr. Buyoya challenged assertions that ethnic divisions existed. But he said there would be ''very positive and very profound changes in the direction of more social justice and genuine democracy.'' **********''In one way or the other,'' he said, ''all sections of the public will be called upon to take part in the decision-making process.

''Frankly, I think there are a lot more important things to worry about like the number of people who are starving in the world and the fact that another major war in the world is a strong possibility.'' **********Even people who own stock said the market's wild activity would not affect them a great deal.

Mrs. Hardisty and her husband had $50,000 invested in several mutual funds. **********A few Americans view the stock market slide as a harbinger of recession or worse. **********''To me this is a time of serious questions,'' said Mark A. Jackson, a 29-year-old sales representative with a chemical company in Indianapolis. ''I have to wonder what effect this will have on business. Are we in store for another time of recession? Are we headed for a depression? I believe a lot of companies will respond to falling stock prices by cutting back on their capital expenditures.'' **********Whether Mr. Jackson's own spending will be altered is unclear.

In a flurry of feathers, its sharpened metal spur flashing, his entry was victorious and the red lay dying beside it in the sand. **********''It's thrilling! It's thrilling!'' Mr. Santos said. ''It's violent, like Philippine politics.'' Nation's Two Great Sports **********Cockfighting and politics are the two great sports of the Philippines, and in the cockpit Mr. Santos was indulging in both of them. **********A candidate for councilor in this town 20 miles northwest of Manila -one of 32 men competing for eight seats - Mr. Santos had agreed with the referee that if his name was announced he would help finance any underdogs. He did not suspect that his own bird would be one of these. **********''Everyone hears, 'Councilor Santos, Councilor Santos,' '' he said. ''What more campaigning do you want?'' **********And then, he said, he would turn to the ''Cristo,'' the middleman, and say, ''Brother, bet me 500 pesos on the favorite.'' However the fight goes, Mr. Santos said, he breaks even. **********In the Philippines, people often play politics the same way. **********Mr. Santos, for example, is running on the Liberal Party slate, which opposes the slate endorsed by President Corazon C. Aquino. But he calls himself an Aquino man just the same. **********''We are now the opposition, but actually we are not,'' Mr. Santos said. ''We still belong to the coalition.'' The Traits They Share The two quintessentially Filipino pastimes have a good deal in common. **********As in the cockpit, Philippine politics - from coups to constitutions - begins with a frenzy of bet-placing. **********In the cockpit, as in the political coffee shop, the bettors wave their hands and hiss their odds in time-honored signals that continue noisily even after the fight has begun. **********The betting, like politics, is multilateral, with alliances crisscrossing and interweaving through the shouting crowd, and it sometimes becomes hard to tell where the real stakes lie. **********The bettors must be as fast-moving as the action itself, and in both arenas the decisive question is sometimes not who wins but how agile a man has been in placing his bets. **********In a nation where politics is based on personalities rather than ideologies, it matters less whether the winner is a red or a gray than whether the bettor wins along with him. **********The cocks themselves, like Filipino politicians, posture and raise their feathers in Elizabethan ruffs as the fight begins, leaping suddenly into the air in vivid displays of aggression. How Marcos Lost Respect **********Sometimes, the posturing itself is enough, and one of the cocks turns and runs, pecking at the gate of the arena to escape combat. **********President Ferdinand E. Marcos fled his palace in February 1986 after three days of intense posturing, with hardly a shot fired, and never regained the respect of Filipinos. **********A cock like this is known as a runner, and is cooked and eaten. **********''Nobody will bet money on a runner,'' Mr. Santos said. **********Similarly, if both cocks are too wounded and exhausted to make a kill, the referee lifts them both to see which maintains a posture of aggression, pecking feebly at its opponent. **********And as in Philippine politics -where the current local election campaign has begun before the last contested ballots of May's legislative poll have finally been tallied - the combat never really ends. **********Even as the man with the whisk broom enters the pit to sweep up the feathers, and the losing cock is carried out by its feet, the shouting of the bettors again fills the arena, along with the crowing of other roosters ready for a fight. But Cockfights Aren't Fixed **********At home over bottles of San Miguel beer, as a fluorescent light buzzed overhead, the talk among Mr. Santos and his friends was of politics and cockfighting. **********There are differences, the men agreed. **********Unlike such other betting sports as boxing, horse racing and politics, Mr. Santos asserted, cockfights are rarely fixed. **********And unlike politics - or coups -where threats and warnings are often an end in themselves, a cockfight is always a fight to the finish. **********''The cock that you have will die for your money,'' Mr. Santos said. **********In this way, cockfighting may offer a catharsis for a hesitant and self-doubting people, a country in which foreigners sometimes comment that ''everything starts but nothing is finished.'' **********It also reflects, as Mr. Santos noted, an undercurrent of violence throughout the nation that surfaces when men compete for elective office. **********Political killings, some in towns only a few minutes' drive from from Malolos, have become an almost daily occurrence in the present campaign, which ends in mid-January. Hedging His Bets **********Filipinos seem to be taking the political violence in stride. ''There are too many candidates anyway,'' remarked a young woman in Manila, a journalist. **********The betting in Malolos, in a hot tin-roofed cockpit similar to arenas in most Philippine towns, involved about 10,000 pesos, or $2,000, on each fight. **********The amounts were small in comparison with the major contests in big cities, where millions of pesos are sometimes staked on one encounter. **********But it was big money in a town like Malolos where Mr. Santos, a former clerk of courts, planned to spend about 20,000 pesos on his election campaign. **********Though he will continue to visit the cockpit during the campaign, he said, he will also continue to hedge his bets. **********''I cannot afford to lose money on a fight now,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/18/world/address-by-gorbachev-to-congress-is-weighed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 321, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Address by Gorbachev To Congress Is Weighed", "print_headline": "Address by Gorbachev To Congress Is Weighed", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration wants Mikhail S.

In response, colleges are increasingly providing friendly advisors, livelier teachers and better living conditions to increase retention of first-year students - which means the school needs to attract fewer of them the next time around. **********At the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, for example, retention of students has increased 11 percent in the last decade, and the college has used some of the money it saved on recruiting to completely remodel its dormitories. **********''They look like Holiday Inns,'' says R. Thomas Snider, assistant to the vice chancellor. ''We've set a goal of reducing the university by 200 students each year for four years. We started last year with the idea that about a third would come from the freshman class.

Minnesota students need to be convinced the $13,640-a-year liberal arts college is a bargain. But to eastern students a ''bargain'' means ''it must not be that good.'' Messages headed east today explain why the lower cost of a professor's groceries and less expensive real estate can help lower tuition in Northfield, Minn. **********The message must be working.

One device is in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, near the Soviet nuclear test site, and the Defense Department will use data from this and other instruments to improve United States monitoring. **********The data will ''improve our yield estimation'' of Soviet nuclear blasts, according to a budget document prepared last year by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the Pentagon. Better Distinguishes Tests **********The document also said the data would be useful in improving American ''discrimination capability'' to distinguish Soviet nuclear tests from earthquakes. Such an ability would be necessary to monitor a low limit on the size of underground tests or a total ban on testing. **********The document was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by William M. Arkin of the Institute for Policy Studies, a nongovernmental research center, and was later made available to The New York Times. **********Some American Government experts have long been interested in establishing a way to monitor Soviet nuclear tests from China. But China has resisted overt efforts at gathering intelligence about Soviet blasts. Initial Suggestion Last Year **********Last year, specialists at the Energy Department, which manages the nuclear testing program, expressed interest in negotiations with the Chinese to set up an advanced array of sensitive seismic devices in China to monitor Soviet tests, particularly blasts of very low yield. The State Department advised against such a move, arguing that the proposal was politically sensitive for the Chinese and that Washington should adopt a go-slow approach. **********The Energy Department's plans were disclosed in budget documents last year before the United States and China decided whether to conduct such talks. The disclosure distressed the Chinese, and the Energy Department effort was dropped. **********Despite this controversy, China and the United States proceeded with a separate project to set up nine monitoring stations in China, primarily for studying and predicting earthquakes. The network was completed last year - using equipment made by China, the United States and other Western nations - under an agreement between Chinese Government seismologists and the United States Geological Survey. **********China and the United States share the cost of the network, and the Defense Research Agency pays most of the American costs. **********''We look on it as a scientific reserach project for the study of earthquakes,'' said David P. Russ of the Geological Survey. ''If a contributor has some other purposes, that is his business. It is not the primary purpose.'' **********Mr. Russ added all of the data would be made public. Another Device in Manchuria **********One device is in Urumqi in Xinjiang, in the northwestern part of China. The device is about 600 miles from the Soviet test site at Semipalatinsk in Central Asia. Another device, in Manchuria, will allow the United States to learn more about the geology of the Soviet Union. **********American officials said that although the network was completed last fall, minor technical problems were still being worked out. The officials said there was a delay of several months in receiving and analyzing the data from China. As a result, the United States has not had a chance to evaluate data on recent Soviet tests, which began in February, when the Russians ended their 18-month moratorium. **********Today, the Soviet Union conducted its third nuclear test since the end of its moratorium. **********In 1981, it was reported that the United States and China were secretly operating an electronic intelligence-gathering station in China to monitor signals from Soviet missile tests. That secret project is different from the installation of the seismic devices, which is being done openly and primarily for scientific research. **********The data from China will supplement information gathered from seismic research installations in Norway, Pakistan, Turkey, South Korea, India and Japan, among other countries. In addition, the Air Force operates secret installations around the world to monitor Soviet tests. Issue of Treaty Compliance **********Data on the size of Soviet tests are important because of the need to determine whether the Soviet Union is complying with two treaties from the 1970's that set a limit of 150 kilotons for underground nuclear explosions. A kiloton represents the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT. **********Many experts inside and outside the Government say the Russians are complying with the treaties, which the United States has not ratified. The Reagan Administration has charged that it is ''likely'' that Moscow has violated the treaties, but it is re-examining the issue. **********The data are also important because such information may enable the United States to make more precise estimates of Soviet tests using devices outside the Soviet Union. The Administration has said the monitoring of the treaties should be improved by on-site monitoring at the Soviet test site using a cable inserted in the ground. But some experts say that such intrusive monitoring techniques are not necessary and that improvements in seismic monitoring outside the Soviet Union and possible installation of seismic devices inside the Soviet Union would suffice. Seismometer in Ocean Floor **********In other efforts to improve seismic monitoring abilities, the Defense Research Agency has supervised an experiment about 600 miles off the Kamchatka Peninsula on the Pacific coast of the Soviet Union. **********In that experiment, the Glomar Challenger ship was used to drill a hole in the ocean floor and install a seismometer, according to the budget document from the agency.

The base had often been used by Libyan planes that bombed Chad. **********Chad added that its forces took 312 prisoners, including two Yugoslavs who it described as mercenaries and one East German. **********The Chadian raid on Saturday followed a Libyan siege of the northern Chad town of Ounianga Kebir. Libya has intervened in Chad repeatedly during the civil war that has gone on almost continuously since Chad's independence in 1960, but the raid on Matan as Sarra was the first foray into Libya by Chadian Government forces. Air Strike on Chad **********Libya responded Monday by sending warplanes over Ndjamena, the Chadian capital, one of which was shot down by French forces. Today Chad's Ambassador to France said that Libyan planes bombed three towns in northern Chad earlier in the day. **********Ahmad Allam-Mi, the ambassador, said the three towns - Wour, Yebbi Bou and Fada - suffered some destruction, but he said that he did not know the number of casualties. **********In describing the attack on Matan as Sarra, the Chadians said they also demolished 70 Soviet-made tanks, eight radar stations and a radio-scrambling device at the airbase. Chad also said its forces destroyed two runways, and that the base ''no longer exists.'' **********The number Chad reported would be the largest toll of casualties Libya has suffered in its 14-year war with Chad. Chad said 65 of its soldiers were killed and 112 wounded in the attack. Libyan Account of Battle **********Today Libya said it had repulsed a second attack by the Chadians on the base and chased them back into Chad. **********Neither the Chadian accounts nor the Libyan report could be independently confirmed. **********Again today, French officials tried to play down their role in Chad, maintaining that the downing of the Libyan bomber Monday did not represent a more aggressive attitude toward Libya. They said that in downing the Soviet-made long-range TU-22 bomber, France's force of 1,200 men in Chad was merely carrying out its role of protecting southern Chad. **********''If France shot down a Libyan plane Monday, it is because it was seeking to bomb Ndjamena,'' Jean-Bernard Raimond, the Foreign Minister, said today. Plea for Peace by Chirac **********In a television interview tonight, Prime Minister Jacques Chriac called on the two nations to stop fighting. **********Mr. Chirac added, however, that ''Chadian authorities are entitled to take control of their territory.'' **********Libya has said that France's action put it in ''direct confrontation'' with Libya. The Libyan news agency, Jana, has accused Chad of being a tool for the ''imperialist'' French and Americans. Both nations have supplied arms to Chad's forces, which have pushed the Libyans out of much of Chad over the last eight months. Greater Consultation Sought **********Francois Fillon, chairman of the defense committee of France's National Assembly, said today that France should reinforce logistical support for Chad, but only on condition that President Hissen Habre consult more with France before taking military action. **********Last weekend, French officials voiced dismay at Chad's attack into Libya. And in early August, French officials criticized President Habre's forces for attacking and capturing Aozou, the main town in the 43,000 square mile border strip that is claimed by Libya and Chad. **********France has urged Chad to agree to settle the dispute over the Aozou strip by arbitration. On Aug. 28, Libyan forces recaptured Aozou. **********Late Monday, Togo called for a cease-fire between Chad and Libya, saying the fighting was taking on ''increasingly worrisome proportions.''

Directorate Defers **********The nine-member Sandinista National Directorate, which has been all-powerful in Nicaragua since the 1979 revolution, still meets regularly and still has the last word on policy matters. But there are indications that Mr. Ortega, 41 years old, has become the principal figure on the directorate and that it now normally accepts his recommendations. **********Mr. Ortega has maintained a high public profile while isolating potential rivals and placing allies in key Government posts. **********''It isn't something that happened overnight, but the trend is very much in Ortega's direction,'' said an ambassador who maintains personal ties with Sandinista leaders. ''In Latin America, the presidency carries with it a significant enhancement in political power, and that is what has happened here.'' **********Although all Sandinista leaders share a common nationalist and Marxist ideology, Mr. Ortega has been identified by political scientists and others who study modern Nicaragua as among the least dogmatic members of the National Directorate. **********Mr. Ortega's rise within the Sandinista front has been steady. He was a guerrilla leader, became a member of the first revolutionary junta in 1979 and later became ''junta coordinator.'' In 1984, he was the Sandinista candidate for president and won a large victory in an election boycotted by part of the opposition. His term runs until 1991. **********''In today's Nicaragua, there is no longer any doubt that Ortega is at the center of power,'' said Luis Humberto Guzman, a member of the National Assembly who was in Niquinohomo to hear the President's speech on Feb. 21. Borge Faction in Decline **********In December, Mr. Ortega won an important political victory when the assembly, which the Sandinistas control, rejected proposals to limit presidential terms. Before the vote, there had been speculation that supporters of Interior Minister Tomas Borge, another member of the National Directorate, would seek to limit Mr. Ortega's presidency to a single term. **********''The implication of the vote is that Ortega plans to stay in office,'' said a diplomat who follows deliberations in the assembly. ''Borge's future, and by extension his political power base, was put in severe doubt.'' **********Mr. Borge, who helped found the Sandinista front 25 years ago and is the sole survivor of its earliest battles, was once considered a factional rival of Mr. Ortega. Under his guidance, the Interior Ministry has built a large police and security apparatus that includes thousands of combat troops. **********''It got to the point where if Interior Ministry people in the field spotted the enemy, they wouldn't call in the army but would try go get Interior Ministry troops there instead,'' a Sandinista official said. **********Mr. Ortega's military connections, however, are firm - he has the backing of his brother Humberto, the Defense Minister. Humberto Ortega is considered to be his brother's strongest ally on the National Directorate, and analysts now often refer to ''the Ortega faction'' as the dominant force in Nicaraguan politics. **********In August, President Ortega elevated his brother to a new rank, general of the army, formalizing his position as the top Sandinista military man. Mr. Borge was to have been given the rank of general at a subsequent ceremony, but Mr. Borge canceled it at the last minute. Associates said he feared the new ranking system would be interpreted as a loss of authority or prestige for the Interior Ministry. **********''Borge has lost the game, and the power of the Ortegas on the national directorate is greater every day,'' said Virgilio Godoy Reyes, a former Labor Minister now in opposition. ''But I don't see a lot of bitterness on Borge's part. I think he has been persuaded to accept his role.'' **********Mr. Godoy said Mr. Ortega's emergence was a positive development. ''It means there is someone you can talk to who has the authority to make a decision,'' he said. Borge Allies Lose Posts **********The two National Directorate members considered closest to Mr. Borge, Henry Ruiz Hernandez and Bayardo Arce Castano, have both lost important posts since Mr. Ortega assumed the presidency. Mr. Arce once headed the directorate's political commission, but that commission was abolished in 1985 and replaced with an executive committee that Mr. Ortega heads. And in a Cabinet shakeup, Mr. Ruiz was named Minister of Foreign Cooperation, losing his job as Planning Minister to a civilian with graduate training in management, Dionisio Marenco. **********As Mr. Marenco has gained authority, appearing frequently with Mr. Ortega at public meetings where economic problems are discussed, Agriculture Minister Jaime Wheelock Roman is no longer viewed as the country's top economic planner. Mr. Ortega has taken to apologizing for aspects of Sandinista agricultural policy, though he has never publicly criticized Mr. Wheelock, who is a member of the National Directorate, or any other Sandinista colleague. **********In his speech Feb. 21, Mr. Ortega acknowledged widespread discontent over shortages of beef and dairy products, and said his Government ''still has not drawn up an integral plan for the production of meat and milk.'' **********Despite such statements, however, it is not known whether there has been discord or disagreement on important matters within the Sandinista leadership. The National Directorate meets in secret and does not announce decisions or give any account of its deliberations or votes, and Sandinista officials say Mr. Ortega has asked other members of the directorate to refrain from all public discussion of certain topics, like foreign policy. **********Another key to Sandinista rule is the nationwide network of Sandinista defense committees, which serve as the eyes and ears of the revolution in every village and neighborhood. The defense committees are run by Leticia Herrera, a veteran Sandinista who was formerly a close personal companion of Mr. Ortega. She is also a vice president of the National Assembly. **********According to Sandinistas familiar with party politics, Mr. Ortega is now supervising a review of the several hundred party leaders who hold key posts in Managua and in the provinces. **********''The idea is to see who we have and where they can best be used,'' said one Sandinista. ''Daniel is the main part of the decision-making process.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/world/us-berates-panamanian-regime-in-pressing-for-democratic-rule.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1987-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. BERATES PANAMANIAN REGIME IN PRESSING FOR DEMOCRATIC RULE", "print_headline": "U.S. BERATES PANAMANIAN REGIME IN PRESSING FOR DEMOCRATIC RULE", "body_text": " **********In an effort to bring pressure on Panama's military to allow democratic rule, the Reagan Administration has lashed out in the past 24 hours against the leadership of Gen.

A Rebuke by Abrams **********Against a background of street demonstrations against the Noriega leadership that occurred again today in Panama, Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, delivered a sharp speech Tuesday to the Washington World Affairs Council. **********Officials called the speech the Administration's harshest official rebuke of General Noriega, Panama's de facto leader and the head of Panama's Defense Forces, and one that reflects growing impatience with his leadership. **********An aide to Mr. Abrams suggested that the speech was intended to send a message to General Noriega that the moment for democracy in Panama had come and that the general was clearly ''an obstacle'' to that process. 'Unmistakable Involvement' **********That speech was followed by a State Department statement this noon accusing Panama of ''unmistakable involvement'' in demonstrations Tuesday that caused substantial damage to American Embassy property in Panama. **********Charles A. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said today that the United States would close the United States consular section and the United States Information Service library in Panama. They will be reopened only when Panama ''offers guarantees of appropriate protection.'' **********Another official said the United States is also contemplating a cutoff of economic aid to Panama until there is ''some recompense'' for damage to American property. **********Tension between the two countries has steadily grown since the Panamanian Government declared a state of emergency last month after two days of anti-Government demonstrations. Embassy Building Stoned **********According to reports from Panama, thousands of Panamanians took to the streets to demonstrate against the United States on Tuesday soon after the Government lifted the 19-day state of emergency, which had suspended key constitutional guarantees. **********Romulo Betancur, chairman of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, the leading party in the Government coalition, and several Cabinet ministers led the protest against what they called American meddling in Panamanian affairs because of opposition in the Administration and Congress to restrictions on civil liberties. **********At the American Embassy, demonstrators painted slogans on the walls and stoned the main building and cars in the parking lot. No injuries were reported. **********Some demonstrators chanted, ''Davis, get out of here!'' referring to the United States Ambassador, Arthur Davis. Panama's National Assembly approved a non-binding resolution early Tuesday calling for Mr. Davis's expulsion. Charge on Embassy Attack **********In his statement today, Mr. Redman said Panama had apparently lifted the state of emergency not for the purpose of restoring civil liberties, but ''primarily to orchestrate a demonstration against the U.S. Embassy.'' **********Police protection was withdrawn from the embassy shortly before the crowds reached it, according to Mr. Redman. ''It is clear that a decision was made at the highest levels of the security forces not to protect the embassy,'' he said. **********The demonstrations were prompted in part by a United States Senate resolution approved last week urging a return to democratic rule in Panama. The resolution also called for the ouster of General Noriega pending an investigation into charges of corruption, election-rigging and political assassination. **********In his speech to the Washington World Affairs Council, Mr. Abrams called on Panama's military leaders to ''remove their institution from politics, end any appearance of corruption and modernize their forces to carry out their large and important military tasks'' in defending the Panama Canal. **********The call on Panama's military to stop corruption was interpreted as an indirect reference to drug smuggling. Although Administration officials have privately expressed concern about suspected drug trafficking by the military, Mr. Abrams's remarks are believed to be the first time an American official has publicly referred to such corruption, albeit obliquely.  ----  NORIEGA FOES DEMONSTRATE AGAIN **********PANAMA, July 1 (Reuters) - Anti-Government protesters returned to the streets today to call for the ouster of General Noriega. **********About 3,000 university and high school students, chanting slogans, tried to march peacefully this morning on the presidential palace.

Party leaders also have been unable to find a building in Seoul for their headquarters. They presume that the authorities have warned landlords not to rent space to them, a tactic that has been used in the past. **********More worrisome, they say, are persistent warnings by the Government that it might force the Reunification Democrats to dissolve, and that it might press charges against Kim Young Sam, the party president. **********Officials have accused Mr. Kim of ''defamation of the state'' for two recent remarks. One likened the country's electoral system to that of North Korea; the other warned that the 1988 Seoul Olympics could become ''no more than a re-enactment of the Berlin Olympics under the Nazis.'' The Government and ruling Democratic Justice Party have also singled out for attack a section of the opposition's platform that says ''national reunification is the primary goal of the party, transcending ideology and system.'' 'Threat to the Nation' **********This, the authorities contend, presents ''a threat to the nation.'' They say it implies a willingness to soften South Korea's uncompromising anti-Communist stand. **********In fact, the opposition's policy is close in its language to statements issued by the Government in the past.

The Sandinista Government must, in exchange, negotiate a cease-fire, issue an amnesty, end press censorship and guarantee full political freedom. **********The treaty is to take effect Nov. 7, although the Sandinistas have said they will take some steps before that date. Exiled Priest Returns **********The Rev. Bismarck Carballo, director of the Roman Catholic radio station, and who was expelled from Nicaragua after the station was closed in January 1986, returned on Saturday. His station is expected to be back on the air in a few weeks. Editors of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, which was shut in June 1986, are impatiently awaiting permission to resume publication. **********''For the first time, the Sandinistas have agreed to take a step back, to loosen their rule,'' a South American ambassador said. ''There has never been a possibility like this before.'' **********The peace accord has eclipsed all other topics of discussion in Managua. Senior diplomats posted here are being pressed by their governments for detailed information about the accord's prospects. **********Nearly all the senior Sandinista leaders have made absolute public promises that Nicaragua will comply with every detail of the accord. They have indicated that they are preparing to free thousands of prisoners and find a fomurla to negotiate a cease-fire with the contras. One Official Holds Back **********Only Interior Minister Tomas Borge, who is responsible for internal security and press censorship, has refrained from detailed comment. Mr. Borge's office has said he is not giving interviews for the time being. **********He left Nicaragua on Saturday to visit Cuba. **********After the peace accord was signed, opposition leaders quickly expressed doubt that the Sandinista Government would take it seriously. There is still considerable skepticism, but many opposition politicians have come to embrace the accord as an unexpected but welcome breakthrough in what had seemed a tragically intractable confrontation. **********The opposition placed its seal of approval on the accord last week in a speech by Enrique Bolanos Geyer. Mr. Bolanos heads the country's principal business federation and is among the most articulate and uncompromising Sandinista opponents in Nicaragua. 'Culmination of Our Struggle' **********In a speech to more than 1,000 business people at a convention here, Mr. Bolanos hailed the accord as ''the successful culmination of our struggle.'' **********''There is a commitment signed by President Daniel Ortega which obliges him, among many other things, to give Nicaraguans back our rights to a free press and to complete freedom of spoken, written and televised expression, along with our unrestricted right to meet and demonstrate in public,'' he said. **********''And as if that were not enough,'' Mr. Balanos continued, the accord will be monitored by a National Reconciliation Commission ''providentially, for us, headed by his eminence Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo.'' **********The presence of the intensely anti-Sandinista Cardinal on the commission is among the factors that seem to give the peace initiative a better chance than past efforts. 'Now Is the Time' **********The rebels view Cardinal Obando with a reverence that borders on veneration. If he were ever to determine that the Sandinistas had lived up to all their commitments under the peace accord, and if he were then to appeal to the contras to stop fighting, they would be almost forced to obey. **********''I think the Cardinal sees himself as the one who is finally going to fix this mess,'' said an opposition member of the Legislative Assembly. ''He thinks that now is the time and he is the man.'' **********Many obstacles remain, not all of them within Nicaragua. One possible threat, some Central American officials say, is the Reagan Administration's announcement last week that it will seek renewed funding for the contras. **********Despite these uncertainties, opposition leaders have begun preparing for what they hope will be a dramatically different political climate after the peace accord takes force. **********''Nov. 7 is the day the lid comes off,'' said Mauricio Diaz Davila, who represents opposition political parties on the Reconciliation Commission. ''On Nov. 8, we take to the streets.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/27/business/final-battles-shape-up-on-major-banking-bill.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1987-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1013, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Final Battles Shape Up On Major Banking Bill", "print_headline": "Final Battles Shape Up On Major Banking Bill", "body_text": " **********It is reckoning time in both the Congress and the Reagan Administration for the most far-reaching banking legislation in more than seven years. **********The bill, approved by conferees on July 1, would rescue the depleted insurance fund for savings and loan associations and set back the deregulation of the financial system. **********After almost four weeks of work on the bill's final language, the House and Senate have just a few days remaining to approve it before they begin their August recess. 'The Decisions Are All Political' **********The White House has both threatened to veto the bill and sent conciliatory signals to Congress about a possible compromise. Certain members of the Reagan camp are concerned about possible runs by depositors at some of the weakest thrift institutions if aid is not forthcoming. Others say that tension continues to exist in the Administration between the pragmatists and the more committed believers in deregulation. **********Moreover, they describe the threatened veto as a major test of President Reagan's support in Congress. **********''I think we are now at a point where the decisions are all political, and not based on what is necessarily good economic policy,'' said one lobbyist in the Reagan camp. **********There are three main parts to the bill. One would allow the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which insures depositors' accounts for up to $100,000, to borrow as much as $8.5 billion. Another would prohibit the creation of new limited-service banks - financial institutions that either take deposits or make loans, but not both. A third would stop banks from underwriting new types of securities until March 1988. A Stern Warning **********On Tuesday, President Reagan met with the Republican leadership in Congress and tried to whip up support for a veto. That afternoon, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, sternly warned that a veto was all but assured, calling the legislation ''a very bad bill, unacceptable in every respect.'' **********On that same day, the Federal Reserve Board's departing chairman, Paul A. Volcker, urged the Congress to override any veto, while the budget director, James C. Miller 3d, wrote to Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, that the President had not wavered in his commitment to veto the bill, unless Congress did a major overhaul on its provisions. **********Mr. Garn, as the former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is the President's point man in the Congress, trying to drum up support from at least 33 colleagues to produce the minimum of 34 votes needed to sustain a veto. So far, according to partisans on both sides,Mr. Garn has between 18 and 28 votes. A Bid for a Compromise **********But by midweek, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d began to give out signals that the White House might want to avoid an all-out veto fight. He called Fernand J. St Germain, the Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, and William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, seeking a compromise. **********According to Congressional aides, the Treasury Secretary asked for three changes: *********** The bailout money for the F.S.L.I.C. would be increased to $12 billion, from $8.5 billion. *********** The ban on creating limited-service banks would end after two years. *********** A program to grant regulatory leniency to troubled thrift institutions would be made stricter. 'Too Little, Too Late' **********The Reagan Administration contends that the troubles of the thrift industry go far beyond the $8.5 billion in borrowing authority for the F.S.L.I.C. that the bill would set. The Administration also argues that banning new limited-service banks would be a major setback to its policy of deregulating the banking system. **********In response, the two banking chairmen indicated in a letter that the ban on limited-service banks, also known as non-bank banks, was not negotiable. They added, ''We believe it would be fruitful to attempt to consider some modifications.'' **********Mr. Baker wrote back: ''I am pleased that you are willing to work with the Administration. It would certainly be unfortunate if the F.S.L.I.C. recapitalization were too little, too late and again bogged down because of contentious extraneous issues,'' referring to the fate of limited-service banks. **********House and Senate aides predict that the two chairmen may be willing to raise the F.S.L.I.C. rescue to $10 billion and ''clean up'' some of the provisions, but they wonder whether that would satisfy the President and the Treasury, both strong advocates of limited-service banking. Broader Political Implications **********''I think their bottom line is to get rid of Title 1,'' said a prominent lobbyist, referring to the bill's provision to ban the creation of limited-service banks. ''If they don't get rid of that in some way, I think there is little doubt there will be a veto.'' **********Finally on Friday, the open channels between Congress and the Treasury appeared to break down. ''Proxmire simply told them that he has the votes to override any veto, so why compromise that much,'' one banking lobbyist said. **********But for the White House, a veto of the banking bill has political implications far beyond the difficulties for the F.S.L.I.C. and limited-service banks. With the President beleaguered by the Iran-Contra affair, entering his last 18 months in office, some of his advisers are recommending that he display his strength by vetoing a series of measures. **********If that becomes the White House strategy, some lobbyists feel Mr. Reagan has a good chance of picking up the 34 votes in the Senate to sustain a veto. **********''Under those conditions, you would see a full-court press, and if all the Republicans realized it was an effort to re-establish that Ronald Reagan was in charge, I think they could win that by a hair,'' one prominent lobbyist said. ''Short of that kind of an effort, they're going to lose.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/world/president-of-south-korea-orders-a-halt-to-debate-on-constitution.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1987-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 791, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA ORDERS A HALT TO DEBATE ON CONSTITUTION", "print_headline": "PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA ORDERS A HALT TO DEBATE ON CONSTITUTION", "body_text": " **********South Korea's prospects for constitutional changes were shattered this morning when President Chun Doo Hwan ordered a halt to all debate on the pivotal issue until after the 1988 Summer Olympics are held in Seoul. **********His decision was likely to sharpen political tensions in South Korea, where the ruling party and the opposition have reinforced hard-line stands in the last few days. **********In a nationally broadcast address, Mr. Chun told Koreans that he would keep the present system of selecting a president by a large electoral college. That process has been denounced by the opposition as one that can be rigged to the Government's advantage. It has even been rejected as undesirable by many politicians in the ruling camp. Vows to Step Down **********Mr. Chun said a new leader would be chosen later this year using the existing rules, and he repeated his often-stated pledge to step down next Feb. 24, at the end of his single seven-year term. **********He blamed opposition ''chaos and infighting'' for his decision, and warned his opponents that he would ''resolutely deal with them'' if they ''continue to be engrossed in futile factional strife over the constitutional issue.'' **********The South Korean leader said he had acted now because time was running short for constitutional change and because the likelihood of compromise seemed remote. Dissident Assails Speech **********His speech was immediately attacked by Kim Dae Jung, the country's most prominent dissident, who has been under house arrest since Wednesday. In a telephone interview from Seoul, Mr. Kim charged that President Chun all along had no intention of changing the political system and wanted to continue his hold on power. **********''From the beginning that was his plan,'' Mr. Kim said, and he predicted ''a harsh crackdown'' against political dissidents. **********President Chun, in his 35-minute speech, said: ''We must not waste this important period when we must decide the destiny of the nation by continuing to be absorbed in counterproductive conflict, confrontation and antagonism. To do so would deepen our internal schisms and dissipate national resources, thereby endangering the very existence and survival of the nation.'' **********Mr. Kim, the opposition leader, also accused the Government of having fomented internal divisions that led last week to a breakup of the main opposition group, the New Korea Democratic Party. **********In that split, Mr. Kim and another leading opposition figure, Kim Young Sam, created a new party committed to a no-compromise position in its demand for direct presidential elections to choose the next national leader. The Kims also took most of the old party's National Assembly members with them, leaving behind an ineffectual shell. Gulf Is Widened **********Their move widened the gulf between the opposition and the ruling Democratic Justice Party, triggering a series of events that culminated in President Chun's announcement today. **********In his speech, the Korean leader said he would move ''progressively'' to increase local autonomy in a country where mayors and other local officials are designated by the national Government. He also pledged ''to broaden the basis for democratic progress,'' a phrase that implied a possible loosening of some political restraints. He offered no specifics, however. **********Mr. Chun, a former general who siezed power in late 1979 after the assassination of President Park Chung Hee, has been cool from the start to the idea of constitutional change. **********Early last year he sought to postpone any political reforms until after the 1988 Olympics, but public pressure, including a surge in campus demonstrations, forced him last spring to agree to negotiations on the issue. **********Since then, however, the rival parties have been hopelessly deadlocked. While the opposition insists on direct presidential elections, the ruling camp calls for an elected Parliament that would then pick a prime minister. Two Different Proposals **********Each side has defended its proposal as more democratic in a country that has never had a peaceful transfer of power since it was formed in 1948. **********It appeared from this morning's announcement that Mr. Chun and his aides have no intention of dealing with the Kims directly on the constitutional issue, and might not even recognize the legitimacy of the new party. **********The action also increases the probability that Mr. Chun will try to designate his party's next presidential candidate and, by extension, his successor.

One colleague said yesterday of Mr. Eder that he ''could not have spent all the money he made even if he quit tommorrow.'' **********In its indictment, the grand jury said that Mr. Eder, 41 years old, and other Paine Webber employees were engaged in a scheme to help clients filter money into their accounts without filing required I.R.S. documents. The papers, called Currency Transaction Reports, or C.T.R.'s, must be filed by brokerage houses with the I.R.S. for all single cash deposits that exceed $10,000. **********David Speers, Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the case, said that Mr. Eder's clients were not trying to launder funds that had been obtained illegally. They merely wished to avoid reporting the deposits to the I.R.S. ''There is no connection to organized crime or narcotics in this case,'' he said. ''A C.T.R. is an I.R.S.-type statute designed to facilitate the collecton of taxes. This was a tax-oriented scheme.'' Separate Charges **********Mr. Eder was also charged with separate crimes of creating false records to disguise the receipt of cash by Paine Webber from customers, and of destroying those records after he learned his activities were the subject of a Federal investigation. **********In order to avoid filing the I.R.S. documents, the indictment charges that Mr. Eder received cash in excess of $10,000 on several occasions, but deposited the money into his clients' accounts in amounts of just under $10,000 on several different days. The indictment cites eight such deposits between August 1981 and July 1983. **********Funneling such money into client accounts would give a stockbroker more money to manage, and the opportunity to earn more commissions. **********Other Paine Webber employees that the Government contends were involved were not named in the indictment. The indictment also did not name Mr. Eders' clients who were purportedly involved. 'Investigation Is Ongoing' **********Mr. Speers said that ''the investigation is ongoing,'' but declined to say if additional indictments would be forthcoming. **********Mr. Eder joined Paine Webber in 1980, when his previous employer, Blythe Eastman Dillon, was acquired by Paine Webber. Over the next six years he built up a large stable of retail clients, garnering millions in commissions and a six-figure salary. **********In a news release accompanying the indictment, the Government said that from 1982 through 1986 Mr. Eder produced more brokerage commissions than any other broker at Paine Webber and was also the firm's most highly compensated broker. **********Those contentions were contested by sources close to Paine Webber, who nevertheless acknowledged that Mr. Eder had been a prolific producer. 'One of the Top Guys' **********''I know for a fact that he wasn't the No. 1 broker last year,'' the source said, ''but he was clearly one of the top guys at the firm.'' **********Mr. Eder was indefinitely suspended from Paine Webber on Jan. 22, 1987, when the firm learned that the Government was preparing a case against him. Mr. Eder resigned on Feb. 17. **********However, sources with knowledge of the case said yesterday that Paine Webber was aware that Mr. Eder was under investigation as long as a year ago, and conducted its own internal investigation to determine if he had committed any illegal acts. That search did not turn up anything, the sources said, and the firm, which heard nothing more from the Government about the case, assumed the investigation had been dropped. **********In a statement yesterday, Paine Webber said: ''There is no room in our organization for people who either violate the law or jeopardize the trust our clients and fellow employees place in them.'' **********Mr. Eder, who lives in Woodmere, L.I., could not be reached for comment.

This could include adjusting interest rates or their nations' money supplies. **********The cautiously worded statement, one of the few ever issued by a meeting of central bankers, was widely viewed as seeking to reassure the financial markets. Stock Market Falls Again **********Stock market investors took little comfort from the meeting. The Dow Jones industrial average finished at 1,900.20, off 58.85 points, or 3 percent. It was the average's ninth-worst point decline ever.  [ Page D1. ] [ In Tuesday trading in Tokyo, the New York decline was echoed, as the Nikkei average of 225 stocks fell 731.91 points, or 3.3 percent. And the dollar fell to a postwar low of 133.30 yen. Page D1. ]  The bankers' statement emphasized the bankers' willingness to take coordinated action with their governments to reduce the huge trade imbalances that have destabilized financial markets. **********Economists interpreted the statement as aimed at the United States, urging it to do more to reduce its budget and trade deficits. ''The central bankers are clearly trying to put some quiet pressure on the United States to cut its deficit,'' said Geoffrey Dennis, an economist with James Capel & Company in London. **********The dollar also continued to slide, as traders saw no signs that the central bankers intended to support the American currency. There were also renewed indications that foreign governments were unwilling to defend the dollar if the Reagan Administration would not.  [ Page D8. ]  Expectations had been larger than usual for the central bankers' regular monthly meeting. Not only was it the first such gathering since the stock market and dollar started plunging, but it also was attended by Alan Greenspan, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. It attracted more than 50 reporters. Normally only half a dozen attend. **********The meeting was held in Basel, a thriving medieval city astride the Rhine that serves as the headquarters for the Bank for International Settlements. This institution is the central bank for the world's central banks and coordinates many of their activities. **********Although the falling dollar was a main subject during the two days of meetings, the central bankers announced no specific measures that would deal with interest rates or the supply of money to help stabilize the dollar. Several currency analysts said the fact that the central bankers disclosed no specific actions or policies helped push the dollar lower in today's trading. **********Other analysts asserted, however, that the markets were not expecting - and should not have expected -much from this regular monthly central bankers' meeting. **********''These are central bankers, and the action is in the hands of finance ministers and politicians,'' said Christopher Johns, senior currency economist with Phillips & Drew in London. **********In the statement issued after their meeting ended late today, the bankers ''expressed their satisfaction'' at the measures taken ''to maintain the smooth functioning of the financial system'' during the recent market turmoil. Analysts viewed these words as the central banks congratulating themselves for intervening to help keep the dollar's trading orderly and injecting liquidity to help prevent financial institutions from going under during the crisis. **********In addition, the bankers welcomed the ''cooperation'' shown by ''recent measures taken by European central banks'' to help stabilize their exchange rates and the dollar. Last week, the central banks of West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands and Switzerland all lowered their interest rates. **********The statement was issued by Karl Otto Pohl, president of West Germany's central bank and also the chairman of the group of bankers who met here. The bankers from the Group of 10 industrial nations represented the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden. The president of Switzerland's central bank also was present. **********As Mr. Pohl left today's meeting, he said: ''I have got nothing more to add. The communique speaks for itself.'' **********Several analysts said they had expected at most a vague statement from the bankers because of differences among their nations. European nations and Japan have criticized Washington for its budget deficit and its decision not to oppose the dollar's recent slide in order to help prevent a recession. They worry that the dollar's recent plunge of 7 percent against the German mark and 6 percent against the yen will hurt their exports and economic growth. **********Meanwhile, the United States and other nations have urged Bonn and Tokyo to do more to lower their interest rates and promote domestic consumption, measures that the other countries say would help stabilize the dollar, reduce the American trade deficit and stimulate world economic growth. **********Several analysts said that, although the bankers' statement showed a continuing belief that international cooperation could bolster the markets and reduce trade imbalances, any major coordinated policy actions would have to await a Group of Seven meeting of the major industrial nations. This group is made up of the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. **********Partly because they feared that the markets would react negatively if the meeting produced little, the central bankers sought to play down its importance. ''It's not the sort of meeting where you're going to get any major decisions,'' said one European central bank president during a break. Desire for Stabilization **********The central bankers were generally secretive during the meetings. Making a rare appearance, Satoshi Sumita, of the Bank of Japan did say, as he left for lunch, that Mr. Greenspan and he both ''wish the stabilization of exchange rates,'' although he failed to say whether they agreed on stability at current levels or lower ones. **********The central bankers would not state publicly how low they thought the dollar might fall. Mr. Johns, the Phillips & Drew economist, said he thought the dollar might fall to 155 German marks and 124 yen early next year. However, Mr. Dennis of James Capel was less pessimistic for the dollar, saying it might rebound soon if President Reagan announced major budget deficit reductions, if American trade deficit figures being announced this week showed improvement and if there was a Group of Seven meeting. **********''Everyone in Basel was concerned about the volatility of the dollar's fall, but they have different long-term goals for the dollar,'' he added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/07/business/consumers-credit-cost-increasing.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1987-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 976, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Consumers' Credit Cost Increasing", "print_headline": "Consumers' Credit Cost Increasing", "body_text": " **********Last week's increases in the prime and discount rates dashed any remaining hopes that consumers will soon get a second chance to borrow at rates as low as those that prevailed early this year. **********Friday's increase in the discount rate, which is what the Federal Reserve charges on its loans to banks, was quickly followed by a rise in the prime rate, which is what commercial banks use in setting their interest charges. **********For consumers, the biggest impact will be in mortgages. Since home loans involve tens of thousands of dollars, even a small rise in the interest charge can take a large bite out of disposable income. Move on Loans to Veterans **********Only hours after Friday's announcements by the Federal Reserve and the commercial banks, the Veterans Administration said it would raise its mortgage rate to 10.5 percent, from 10 percent. That would mean increased interest costs to home buyers of $400 a year for an $80,000 mortgage. **********Other mortgage lenders are expected to follow suit. ''We're not going to see single-digit mortgage rates in the foreseeable future,'' predicted Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. **********The average effective mortgage interest rate on existing homes dipped to 9.97 percent last October, the first time in this decade that the rate has fallen below 10 percent. But it turned back upward in March when rates rose in the credit markets. Welcome to Savers **********The effects of the higher general level of interest rates will be felt by other borrowers as well and by investors. For people with high levels of liquid savings, the increases will be welcome because their money will earn more interest. **********''Money market account rates should rise 15 to 20 basis points'' (hundredths of a percentage point) over ''the next month or so,'' said Robert Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a publication that tracks interest rates paid by financial institutions across the country. He predicted that rates on certificates of deposit would rise 25 to 35 basis points. **********But consumers and many investors will be hurt by the rising rates. People who invested in long-term bond funds, for example, already have begun to see the value of their investments decline as a result of the rise in interest rates. **********''The yuppies may be hurt and the elderly who depend heavily on interest income will be helped,'' said Robert A. Schwartz, senior financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. **********In the last week alone, the asset values of mutual funds that invest primarily in long-term bonds dropped an average of 95-hundredths of 1 percent, according to A. Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical Services. That means that a person whose mutual fund holdings were worth $1,000 at the beginning of the week ended the week with a value of only $990.50. Some funds performed even more poorly. The Franklin United States Government Fund dropped 1.31 percent and the Benham Target 2010 fund, which invests in zero-coupon bonds, plunged 8.95 percent, Mr. Lipper said. Rate Often Tied to Prime **********Among borrowers, those who will be hardest hit are people who have taken floating-rate loans, such as home-equity loans or second mortgages. Because of this year's change in the tax law, which still allows individuals to deduct most interest paid on home-equity loans from their taxable income, such borrowing has become increasingly popular. **********But much of it is done on a floating-rate basis, with the interest rate often directly tied to the prime. **********The Chemical Bank charges the prime rate for the first year on its home-equity loans, and then the rate rises to the prime plus 1.75 percentage points. Citibank charges either 1.25 percent or 1.75 percent over prime, depending on how many points the borrower pays when the loan is taken out. At Chemical and Citibank, the increase in the prime rate means a rise in second-mortgage borrowing costs of half a percentage point. On a $50,000 loan that would amount to $250 a year. **********Some issuers of credit cards also have given their customers the option of floating interest rates. The American Express Company's new Optima credit card, for example, will calculate the interest charged by multiplying the prime rate by 1.8. With the prime now at 8.75 percent, that would mean a rate on the Optima card of 15.75 percent.

''We've been sort of ignored for 40 years.'' **********''You can really say that for most people, Valleraugue is almost at the end of the earth,'' she said. ''Even in Nimes, which is the closest city, we're thought to be very remote. People might come during the season to gather mushrooms here, since we have lots of mushrooms in our hills, but then they forget about us.'' **********''Now, maybe we'll be talked about, at least a little,'' Mrs. Recolen said. Threading Villages Together **********The Tour de France, which began in 1903, has often been cited in this country as part of the national patrimony, an event that, in its annual 2,500-mile circuit, is supposed to thread together all of the hundreds of villages passed through by the racers in their fury to win. **********To be sure, the tour is followed with intense excitement throughout the country, and Valleraugue is no exception - even if not everybody here found the race a positive development. **********A few days ago, a woman was observed at the Town Hall asking exactly what time traffic on the road would be blocked for the race, since she wanted to visit relatives in Montpellier, a bit more than an hour's drive away, and did not want to find herself sealed inside the village. **********''I'm not passionate about the Tour de France,'' she said, by way of explanation. 'It's Very Exciting' **********''But you should be,'' Louis Mazel, who has managed the Town Hall since 1962, said, not really seriously. ''It's very exciting.'' ''I'm a free person,'' the woman replied, ''and I'm free not to be excited by a bicycle race.'' **********Still, most of the 1,200 or so people who live in the village and the rugged surrounding countryside seemed excited enough to drop whatever they were doing this morning and watch the event. Many of them came to town hours in advance, lining both sides of the road that leads through the town, past the lone grocery, the bakery and the butcher shop, and the place where newspapers are sold, sometimes a day late. **********Those who could not be in Valleraugue came down from various hilltop hamlets and parcels of farmland to take up positions wherever they could along the route of the race. Valleraugue is trying to encourage its rather small tourist industry by setting up campsites on the land of local farms. And so, the town is a meeting ground of city folks, here for the fresh air and the mountain scenery, and the local people who call themselves peasants and have scratched a living out of the rocky hills raising apples, onions and goats. A Commercial Prelude **********What they all saw was a long prelude and then the passage of the racers, so swift and sudden that it seemed to be over before it began. **********The race, which has become a highly commercial affair in recent years, is preceded by a two-hour caravan of hundreds of trucks, cars and motorcycles, emblazoned with the names of the companies that sponsor competing teams of racers. The caravan passed through, its engines growling, its loudspeakers blaring for the benefit of the scattered groups of customers lining a pristine rural road that has barely seen an advertising billboard in half a century. Among the noisily and cheerfully advertised products were computers, tires, comic books, women's clothing, supermarket chains, watches, copying machines, newspapers, automobiles. Then, a few squadrons of motorcycle police, who descended on Valleraugue like a mechanized infantry division, appeared on the road. They were followed by the racers, pedaling hard, certainly not stopping to look around at the scenery. They were followed in turn by another caravan, this one of cars and trucks carrying spare bicycles for the teams of racers. **********The general feeling in town was that the race would give what a saleswoman at the newsstand called ''a little window of publicity''; the press would mention Valleraugue, at least in its reports on the race today, and maybe that would lead to more tourism, the activity seen here as a possible cure to long-term economic problems. **********It happens that Valleraugue and its region, a place of picturesque, crumbling stone villages perched alongside laboriously constructed, narrow stone terraces, is one of those regions in France - often called deep France by the Parisians - where an old way of life seems on the verge of extinction. A 40-Year Interval **********The last time the Tour de France passed through here, about 40 years ago, this was a prosperous region producing raw silk thread for the weavers of Lyons, about 200 miles away. Mulberry trees, whose leaves are needed to feed the silk worms, grow bountifully in the region and were the basis for the rural prosperity. The evidence of this can be seen in imposing square stone houses nestling in the corners of terraced fields. **********The industry died away after the war, apparently because of Japanese competition, and many of the former farming families went elsewhere, leaving those who stayed behind to cultivate fruit orchards or to raise goats for cheese. According to local officials, however, these activities are fast disappearing, with the risk that the area will be deserted by everybody except those who maintain some of the stone houses as vacation homes. **********''The problem is that even tourism cannot survive if the agriculture disappears,'' Mr. Mazel at the Town Hall said. ''Underbrush grows on untended land and is very prone to fires, which could really destroy the whole region.'' **********Obviously, one passage of the Tour de France hardly marks the village renaissance, and it was not being seen that way here. Nonetheless, at the Town Hall and elsewhere in the village the hope was being expressed that the race might blow away some of dust of obscurity and remind others in France that Valleraugue is beautiful and unspoiled and not all that remote after all."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/11/business/business-digest-friday-september-11-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 717, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1987", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1987", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********The seven regional telephone companies were barred from providing long-distance service or making telephone equipment.

Last year alone, its field researchers contacted close to 110,000 people to talk about food - taste, preparation, nutritional value, the works. On the basis of what they said, Campbell changed the seasonings in five Le Menu dinners and introduced a line of low-salt soups called, appropriately enough, Special Request. **********Both the new and the reformulated products are selling well, so the survey techniques clearly gave Campbell's a good reading of consumer preferences. But could Campbell's have gotten the same information more easily - say, from finding out how similar products were selling? Put another way, could knowing what consumers buy today give Campbell's, or any consumer products company, a good idea of what they will buy tomorrow? **********These are by no means simple questions. At least since the days of Sigmund Freud, psychologists have been debating the best ways to predict human behavior. But now that debate has spilled onto Madison Avenue and into board rooms. It lies at the heart of a controversy that is pitting computer specialists against pollsters, market researchers against marketing executives, and psychologists against each other. The outcome could affect not only how companies make marketing decisions but what products people will get to buy. **********In one camp sit the behaviorists, who believe that the best indicator of how people will act in the future is how they act now. Opposite them is the cognitive camp, which says people operate from an endless array of motivations and that the only way to predict what someone will do is to figure out what is going on inside his or her mind. **********In practical terms, the two sides are debating whether computers can replace people as the linchpins of consumer research. And the behaviorists are winning converts. **********''The role of the consumer as the party giving answers and opinions will be significantly less,'' said Jagdish Sheth, a consumer psychologist at the University of Southern California. ''It will be replaced by measuring his behavior, not his opinions.'' **********''We are heading to an age where most information can be captured electronically,'' said George S. Fabian, an executive vice president at Backer, Spielvogel & Bates, a New York advertising agency. ''It is unavoidable. And it is welcome.'' **********Is it? **********Until recently, that would have been a moot question. There were few electronic data sources, so companies had little choice but to plumb the collective consumer mentality through surveys. Ask enough people enough questions, the theory went, and some semblance of truth will emerge. According to Diane Bowers, executive director of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations, companies spend nearly $1 billion each year to ask more than 50 million consumers their opinions on products and services. **********Even proponents of surveys concede that the companies are not buying absolute truth for their money. ''Consumers say they are eating fewer snacks, yet the snack food industry has record sales; they say they are on a diet, yet everyone seems to be more overweight,'' said Anthony J. Adams, director of marketing research and planning for Campbell's. **********Similarly, Lynn R. Kahle, associate professor of consumer psychology at the University of Oregon, cites a recent survey in Detroit in which people were asked what they thought of the Metallic Metals Act. The legislation was purely fictitious; about a quarter of the respondents had an opinion on it anyway. ''People hate to look foolish or uneducated, even to strangers,'' he said. ''They lie all the time to make themselves look good.'' **********STILL, until recently, consumer surveys were the only research game in town, and companies designed countless products, packages and services around them. ''Almost every one of our major product innovations was inspired by something consumers told us,'' said Jonathan B. Sims, manager of media planning and research at the General Foods Corporation. **********But in the last few years, technological and demographic trends have converged to make the validity of surveys suspect. At the same time, alternative ways of gauging consumer preferences have emerged. Scanners in supermarkets and people meters in homes can now electronically record consumer buying and television viewing patterns. That makes it possible for a company to learn overnight how well its product is selling, how competitors are doing and how commercials affect sales. **********Moreover, consumers have systematically been weaning themselves from surveys. In the 1960's, the halcyon days of consumer research, people cheerfully participated in most any question-and-answer exercise that came their way. But that was before many women pursued careers outside the home, before computer-generated phone calls and salesmen masquerading as researchers made many people hostile to surveys, and before banks, insurance companies and other service organizations adopted survey techniques that simply led to survey overload. **********There are even surveys about how people feel about surveys, and they are turning up some discouraging results. ''People are getting burned out on surveys,'' Professor Kahle said. Indeed, studies show that over the last few years, the amount of time it takes an interviewer to get an hour's worth of usable survey data has increased to eight hours, from five. **********And that hour's data are not likely to represent a random sample of the public. Interviewers report little trouble reaching retired people and full-time homemakers. But they have a hard time pinning down working women, city dwellers, young people, families without children and high-income people - often, the very groups that marketers want to reach. **********''No matter how good your sampling method is, as soon as people start refusing in large numbers to participate, your random sample has become a convenience sample,'' said Mr. Sims of General Foods. **********Not surprisingly, companies that sell electronically generated information say computers provide an adequate amount of data on consumer behavior. The small companies and solo practitioners who make a living from field surveys contend that computers simply disgorge information on what is happening without showing why it happens. Such data, they say, cannot provide the basis for a rational marketing decision. **********Neither side is painting the picture all black and white. But each is quite adamant about where the preponderance of evidence falls. **********''Of course we must avoid the arrogance of saying, 'I know you well enough to know how you'll react without asking you questions','' said Lorraine C. Scarpa, vice president of customer information marketing at the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, whose A.C. Nielsen unit is a leader in electronically provided data. ''Still, the real energy in the business is going to the quantitative side.'' **********''Those who still rely on talk rather than scanners for descriptive information are anthropological artifacts,'' said Joseph G. Smith, a consumer psychologist who is president of Oxtoby-Smith Inc., which does field research. ''But what people do does not say anything about why they do it. There is no surrogate available for talking to the consumer.'' **********Corporate annals are rife with stories that support Mr. Smith's contention. Perhaps the most famous is that of the Pillsbury Company's cake-mix fiasco of 30 years ago. Pillsbury came up with a mix that required cooks to do no more than add milk. It yielded a great-tasting cake, yet it bombed in the marketplace. **********Pillsbury failed to ask a key question: How do cooks feel about the time they spend in the kitchen? The company found in a later study that cooks wanted to feel they were ''adding value'' to a packaged product. It reformulated its mix so the cook had to add an egg. Sales took off. **********ATTITUDINAL research helped Mr. Fabian of Spielvogel avoid a similar failure when he designed an ad campaign for an automotive client. He already knew that price was a major factor when people bought cars. But later research ''showed that people will only buy a low-priced car if they feel smart about the purchase,'' he said. Thus, Mr. Fabian designed his campaign around the idea that the best and the brightest were gravitating to his client's low-priced car. **********General Mills has used a similar combination of descriptive and attitudinal data to design a restaurant chain. A few years ago, responding to figures showing that Italian food is the most frequent choice of those who eat out, the company opened its Olive Garden Italian restaurants. But, because attitude data showed that many people felt that Italian food had too much garlic and basil, the company reformulated Olive Garden recipes to make them less authentically Italian but more palatable to diners. As Lawrence D. Gibson, the recently retired director of market research at General Mills, put it: ''Simply tracking what's going on in the world is never going to tell me how much spice to put in my product.'' **********Still, only the biggest - and richest - companies are willing to spend the hundreds of thousands of dollars that it takes to do both descriptive and attitudinal surveys. And many chief executives are more comfortable with hard data generated by computers and are skewing research budgets toward computerized methods. **********''I'd hate to see us become slaves to computer printouts, but managements want to hear what's happening, not what consumers say is happening,'' said Mr. Adams of Campbell's. ''So the data on actual behavior are beginning to push out a lot of the survey data on attitudes.'' **********PARTICULARLY troublesome to many researchers is that their companies maintain the illusion of continuing direct consumer research by using more focus groups. These are groups of 10 or 12 people who are paid an average of about $50 each to sit for a few hours with a mediator and discuss a product, commercial or concept. The sponsor generally sits apart, often behind a one-way mirror, taking notes. **********Focus groups are easy to fit into squeezed marketing budgets. But they use so small a sample that they are not representative of much of anything. ''Sure, you can get a few perceptions from a focus group, but nothing I would want to build a $10 million factory around,'' said Mr. Adams. Nor should companies build a multimillion-dollar ad campaign around them, said Mr. Fabian of Backer Spielvogel. ''Focus groups can only be an add-on to solid qualitative research,'' he said. **********Researchers have a bit more faith in mail surveys. In fact, marketers are making far more use of direct mail than they have in the recent past, betting that hard-to-reach people will respond when they can do so at their own convenience, and that they are less likely to try to impress a sheet of paper than an interviewer. **********Companies are offering incentives in mailed questionnaires. Although some offer contests with expensive prizes, most just offer token payments. ''It's amazing what a nice crisp dollar bill in an envelope will do,'' said Mr. Gibson, the former General Mills executive. ''People feel guilty if they take the dollar and don't fill out their questionnaires.'' **********Market research companies have mounted an ad campaign, using the slogan ''Your Opinion Counts,'' to woo consumers back to surveys. ''People used to feel that surveys were a way to tell manufacturers how to serve them better,'' said Frank Walker, chairman of Walker Research and the man who spearheaded the campaign. ''We're trying to get them to again believe that their participation will come back in better products and services.'' **********Mr. Adams of Campbell Soup is thinking along a similar vein. He wants to advertise the reasons behind the changes in Le Menu and the introduction of Special Request. ''We're considering a campaign saying that last year, we talked to 110,000 of you and here's what we've done,'' he said. ''To keep consumers interested, we have to communicate some of the action that's been taken on research.'' **********General Foods has already started doing that. ''You talked - Post listened,'' the company says on cereal boxes, referring to the new Zip-Pak resealable packaging that it recently started using. **********Computers, meanwhile, are taking some of the drudgery out of the interview process - automatically calling up Question No. 7 for a telephone interviewer, for example, if the survey requires her to skip questions 4 through 6 for any respondent who said ''no'' to question 3. **********Several researchers are trying Conjoint Analysis, a program developed by Sawtooth Software Inc. that helps figure out how important different product attributes are to different people. A participant in a survey on cars, say, might be asked: Would you rather have a two-door blue car or a four-door red car? The next question would be based on the answer to the first. **********''You wind up with a tradeoff analysis,'' said Richard M. Johnson, Sawtooth's president. ''You find out not only someone's favorite color or favorite number of doors, but whether he would sooner give up his favorite color or his door count.'' **********Normally, researchers who use such computerized surveys ask participants to do their own keypunching. ''There's a whole body of research that says that people will answer emotional questions more honestly if they do not have to verbalize their response, but just have to punch in an answer,'' said Diane Schmalensee, vice president of research operations for the Marketing Science Institute. **********Still, computerized interviews are no panacea. They are impractical for national surveys, they are expensive, and they may turn out to be a fad. ''Computer questioning has a lot of novelty,'' said Professor Kahle. ''But by the 24th time they are asked, people will not find it all that attractive.'' **********The whole business of market research seems in for a bumpy few years. When the dust settles, many companies will no longer be around. Others will have found special niches - for example, working with manufacturers whose products are not sold in supermarkets, or with small manufacturers who cannot afford to subscribe to electronic data services that can cost upwards of $500,000 a year. Still others will have been gobbled up by the giants in the research field. **********The consolidation has already started. In August, Dun & Bradstreet bought Information Resources Inc., one of the fastest-growing firms in market research. SAMI, Time Inc.'s market research arm, bought Burke Marketing a few years ago. And last month, the Control Data Corporation, whose Arbitron Ratings Company is a major purveyor of local television and radio ratings, announced that it will buy SAMI/Burke. **********No one is predicting that old-style consumer surveys will ever be easy or inexpensive again. But no one predicts their demise, either. ''High tech will never replace high touch,'' said Dun & Bradstreet's Ms. Scarpa. **********Indeed, although getting a representative sample of people to sit still for an interview will keep getting harder and more expensive, most experts say there will always be enough companies willing to foot the bill. Backer Spielvogel certainly is one. ''People today are marketing me-too products,'' said Mr. Fabian. And that, he says, makes it doubly important to insure that advertising takes into consideration what motivates consumers. ''We will find the money, our clients will find the money,'' he said. ''We can't afford not to.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/21/world/egypt-us-plan-to-raid-libya-reported.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1987-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1025, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EGYPT-U.S. PLAN TO RAID LIBYA REPORTED", "print_headline": "EGYPT-U.S. PLAN TO RAID LIBYA REPORTED", "body_text": " **********Early last year, President Reagan approved a secret directive under which United States military forces would support Egypt in the event of a ''pre-emptive'' attack on Libya, and the two countries continued to prepare for this contingency throughout 1986, Adminstration officials said today. **********The officials said President Reagan agreed to the proposal in early 1986, shortly after the terrorist attacks in the Rome and Vienna airports on Dec. 27, 1985. **********Under the plan, which was supported by some members of Mr. Reagan's National Security Council staff, the United States would support an Egyptian attack on Libya if it were intended as a response to a Libyan military threat. **********The policy allowed for American military strikes against targets inside Libya, officials said. **********The Presidential directive replaced one that had called for logistical support for Egypt only if Libya attacked the Egyptians first, the officials said. **********The Washington Post reported today that the State Department made great efforts in 1985 to block what The Post called a White House plan for a joint American-Egyptian attack on Libya.

We were not trying to start a war.'' **********Another official scoffed at reports that Mr. Mubarak was unwilling to proceed with the military planning. ''They didn't have to be goaded into anything,'' this official said. **********Planning for how to deal with Libya has been a major policy issue for the National Security Council staff for the last several years. In addition to covert operations by the C.I.A. to encourage opponents of Colonel Qaddafi to displace him, the United States conducted bombing raids on Libya last year after what it said was a Libyan-directed attack on a Berlin discotheque frequented by American soldiers. **********Intensified Administration planning on how to deal with terrorism, one official said, was touched off in mid-1985 when Shiite Moslem radicals hijacked a Trans World Airlines flight and held Americans who were aboard hostage in Beirut. **********In one such effort, National Security Council officials began preparing the way for covert arms sales to Iran, in what the Administration has said was an effort to build support for what were believed to be less radical elements in that country. **********Then, in December 1985, terrorists conducted simultaneous attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports in which 20 people were killed and more than 110 wounded. These attacks were subsequently tied to Sabry al-Banna, the terrorist known as Abu Nidal, whose activities over the years are said to have received support from Libya and other Arab countries. **********Officials said it was after these attacks that President Reagan became prepared to authorize extensive American involvement to back Egypt in an attack on Libya even if the attack was in response only to a threat. **********While Abu Nidal is said to receive support from several countries, among them Libya, he also is said to carry out operations without specific sponsorship, and no direct evidence of involvement by Colonel Qaddafi in the airport attacks has been produced. **********In late 1985 the Reagan Administration also began discussing the kidnapping of suspected terrorists for trial in the United States, a proposed program on which The New York Times reported in January 1986. **********Today, officials confirmed a report in The Wall Street Journal that the planning went forward under a Presidential intelligence order, or finding, that authorized the C.I.A. to kidnap terrorists. The officials said, however, that none of the plans had been put into effect. Officials said Lieut. Colonel Oliver L. North, the dismissed National Security Council aide, was directly involved in this effort. **********During this period, according to a military source, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were asked to draw up various contingency plans. One was for an Egyptian invasion of Libya backed by United States air support and logistical assistance, including the use of helicopters to transport Egyptian soldiers. Such an invasion would take place along the Egyptian-Libyan border 600 miles from Tripoli, the Libyan capital. **********The Joint Chiefs were also asked to draw up contingency plans for an American invasion of Libya, but reportedly sought to discourage the idea by arguing that the operation would require six divisions and up to 90,000 men. Administration officials who supported the plans believe the military deliberately overstated its requirements."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/10/business/credit-markets-treasury-bond-prices-climb.html": {"writer_name": "H.

The resultant rise in prices brought in fresh buying throughout the rest of the day. **********In late trading and after a bit of profit taking, the bellwether long bonds, the 7.5's of 2016, were offered at 102 20/32, up 19/32 on the day, and now yield 7.28 percent, compared with 7.33 percent the day before and 7.40 percent a week ago. Flood of Surplus Cash **********The discount rate on the 90-day bills fell eight basis points, to 5.39 percent, as a rising flood of surplus cash sought employment. The Treasury 180-day and one-year bills lost three and four basis points, respectively. The basic Federal funds rate eased a touch, to 5 15/16, late in the day, only slighly affected by the Federal Reserve's $2.5 billion repo operation on behalf of a customer. **********''What we saw today was an awful lot of money chasing a relatively small supply of Treasury paper,'' said Norman E. Mains, first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert's Chicago office. ''As this became apparent, the sellers began holding back and those who had sold short earlier this week began to buy out of their positions.'' **********The relative dearth of Treasury debt in the market and eager sellers always creates an extremely risky situation for those wanting to sell short. ''But as everyone seemed to ignore the day's economic statistics, there were very few sellers of any kind after lunch,'' Mr. Mains said. Moments afterward, the spot March Treasury bond futures, which had been down 11/32, began to climb and closed up 15/32, at 101.19. Lack of Conviction Seen **********Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank's North American headquarters in New York, said that, even when the bond market seemed to be under pressure after a decline in the unemployment rate in December was announced early in the day, the selling lacked conviction. The Government reported that the number of jobless fell two-tenths of 1 percent, to a revised figure of 6.6 percent in December. **********''While employment in the manufacturing sector accounted for only 31,000 of the total gain of 269,000 jobs last month, it does indicate that industrial production rose eight-tenths or nine-tenths of 1 percent in December and that the economy ended 1986 on a rather strong note,'' Mr. Chandross said. **********As a result, he doubted the Federal Reserve would have any reason to lower interest rates in the near future. ''Given this situation, one can say the bond market behaved rather well even before the rally began,'' Mr. Chandross added. **********Although the bellwether long bond showed the best gain, as usual, prices of intermediate Treasury maturities were also strong in the secondary market. In late trading, for example, the 7 1/4 percent notes of 1996 were offered at 101 26/32, up 15/32 and now yielding 6.99 percent; the 7's of January 1994 rose 11/32, to 100 28/32, for a yield of 6.84 percent; the 6 5/8's of 1990 rose 6/32, at 100 12/32, to yield 6.48 percent, and the 6 1/4's of 1988 rose by 3/32, to 100 7/32, to yield 6.13 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/27/world/seoul-protesters-again-face-police-in-fierce-clashes.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1987-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 970, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEOUL PROTESTERS AGAIN FACE POLICE IN FIERCE CLASHES", "print_headline": "SEOUL PROTESTERS AGAIN FACE POLICE IN FIERCE CLASHES", "body_text": " **********With tear gas and raw force, riot police struggled but ultimately managed to retain control of Seoul's streets tonight against tens of thousands of anti-Government protesters. **********The clashes in Seoul and 30 other cities were the most ferocious in a week, and they demonstrated graphically that South Korea's political crisis was not near an end. **********But they also wound up as something of a standoff between dissidents and the police, making it difficult to judge whether they will lead to further unrest, as some fear, or will be the last outburst before a lull, as many hope. A Litmus Test **********Foreign diplomats and other observers had portrayed tonight's events as a litmus test of sorts, and beforehand some spoke with dread about the possibility that serious skirmishes could provoke military intervention. **********Although the numbers in the streets were large and were spread across much of the central city, they lacked the crackling tension evident on other recent nights. Moreover, the police were in charge all night, making the imminent use of troops seem unlikely. Both sides could claim victory. A coalition of opposition groups, which had organized the protests as a ''grand peace march for democracy,'' could point to the large outpouring as evidence of popular reaction against maneuvering this week by President Chun Doo Hwan to defuse the crisis.  [ In Washington, a State Department official who met with President Chun this week expressed optimism about the situation and said Mr. Chun was amenable to changes in the electoral system. Page 3. ]  Reports of Reconciliation The ruling party was reported in the South Korean press tonight as considering new conciliatory moves, including the possibility of an interim government to be replaced through direct presidential elections after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. **********As usual, the crowds today were dominated by college students. But there were many older Koreans as well, middle-class people and laborers, who actively joined in the protests or stood on the sidelines cheering. Across the city, motorists honked horns to show support, creating an enormous din that lasted for more than an hour in some places. **********Large protests, involving tens of thousands altogether, were also reported in about 30 cities, with the numbers said to be greatest in Kwangju and Pusan. Disturbances were described as particularly strong in Kwangju, a symbolically important city because 200 people were killed by soldiers there in 1980. **********But nationwide, there were nowhere near the million people that Kim Young Sam, the opposition leader, had predicted. **********Mr. Kim was one of scores of people taken into brief custody by the police, who showed little patience, liberally using tear gas and fists to break up small groups of people whenever they gathered. **********Mr. Kim was seized as he tried to leave his party's offices to address a scheduled rally that never occurred in nearby City Hall Plaza. He was put into a police van and driven for more than an hour to the Seoul airport and back before being dropped off at his house. Hundreds Confined to Homes **********Earlier in the day, hundreds of dissident leaders had been arrested or confined to their homes to prevent them from reaching designated rallying points for the march. Among them was Kim Dae Jung, another key opposition figure, who had been released only the day before from a house arrest that lasted 78 days. Mr. Kim said he had been told the new restriction would last only a day, and later he said it had in fact been lifted. **********The police could claim victory for maintaining order. There seemed to be many more policemen on the streets than at previous demonstrations, and so they were not overpowered as they had been on several recent days. But that may have been partly because dissidents had shifted tactics to appear more restrained so as not to drive away middle-class supporters. **********For example, thousands of protesters gathered by the East Gate Market, most of them laborers and students. Some picked up stones to hurl at riot policemen, only to have them knocked out of their hands by group leaders. **********Similarly, along Chongno Street, leading to East Gate, thousands of people lined the sidewalks. As some sought to move into the streets, they were pushed backed by leaders who urged against disrupting traffic. Protesters Well Organized **********That demonstrated the organizational skills of the demonstrators, especially the students. So did the conspicuous presence of medical students in white laboratory coats, who patrolled the streets treating the injured and handing out strips of cellophane to protect eyes against the tear gas. **********But generalizations were difficult, and perhaps misleading. **********If East Gate showed a measure of order, South Gate and the Seoul Station, several miles away, were scenes of pitched battles between stone-throwing youths and police officers, who brought in an armored car with a launcher on top. It fired tear-gas canisters into the crowds in deafening automatic bursts. **********Scores of students near South Gate spilled into a nearby street that led to the Seoul Hilton Hotel. When the police routed them from there, they ran into the hotel and refused for a while to leave. **********It was the first major demonstration since President Chun and Kim Young Sam met on Wednesday in what proved to be a vain attempt to end the crisis quickly. Mr. Chun made offers to Mr. Kim that the ruling camp has called significant concessions but that the opposition dismisses as inadequate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/20/world/2-guerrillas-seized-by-bonn.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Guerrillas Seized by Bonn", "print_headline": "2 Guerrillas Seized by Bonn", "body_text": " **********The West German police have arrested a young man and woman on suspicion of membership in the Red Army Faction, a leftist guerrilla group, the federal prosecutor's office said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/16/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 600, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROSPECTS", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS", "body_text": " **********Ripe for Restructuring **********America's big corporations will continue their restructuring - divesting themselves of operations that are inefficient or that do not mesh well with their basic businesses. That's the consensus among the 250 chief executives and other senior managers at large industrial companies polled by research firm Penn & Shoen Associates. **********About 23 percent of the executives said that future restructuring of their corporations - selling units to other companies or to a division's management under a leveraged buyout - was ''very likely.'' Some 27 percent said it was ''possible.'' ''Most of the conglomerates of the 1960's are still ripe for restructuring,'' especially those that have to focus better on their core businesses, said Martin H. Dubilier, chairman of Clayton & Dubilier, a New York leveraged-buyout firm that commissioned the study. The executives agree: Some 77 percent said that units of large corporations could function more effectively if they were free-standing units - even with the same management in place.

Its recent acquisition of Queens Farms Dairy brought the brewer's share of the New York City area's dairy market to more than 20 percent. In New Jersey, the company claims about 50 percent of the dairy business; in Philadelphia, roughly 85 percent. **********Beer and milk might seem an unlikely combination, said Paul Gillette, publisher of Beverage Hotline, an industry newsletter, but these days ''beverage marketing companies are looking across the entire range of potables.'' With beer sales flattening, brewers and others in the mature beverage industry, he says, are looking to acquisitions for growth. Years ago, diversification was always within a given category - liquor companies acquiring wineries, for example. ''Now,'' he said, ''everything is fair game.''

Besides, he added, even one case of fraudulent reporting involves ''hundreds of millions of dollars.'' **********A bill introduced by Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon calls for improved financial disclosure. ''Again and again, on the heels of a clean audit, a company goes belly up,'' Mr. Wyden said, adding that right now ''the process of informing the public and investors is so woefully inadequate that a company has to be virtually a corpse before its condition is made known.'' **********Under Mr. Wyden's bill, an independent auditor who suspects fraud must report it to the company's senior management. If no action is taken, the auditor would tell the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********The National Association of Accountants sees no need for such a bill, saying that the private sector can oversee its own reporting methods and that such fraud is not prevalent. But Mr. Wyden plans to push for the bill in the next Congressional session. ''The majority of business people are honest,'' he said.

Even if they did not cash in their chips, they spent more freely and helped lift the economy, thanks to their new-found sense of wealth. **********Now, however, the market is at a crossroads. After the sharp selloff of recent days, these retail investors and mutual fund owners are wondering if the long, euphoric period is finally over. **********The nervousness of so many little investors, however, is not shared by market professionals. Investment analysts and portfolio managers point out that while they have no way of foretelling what lies ahead, there are few signs to suggest that the stock market's recent decline is the start of something calamitous. The economy remains healthy; corporate profits are strong; inflation, though rising somewhat, remains relatively modest. Correction Needed Before a Surge **********Many say the stock market needs to let off steam after a heady run-up. And indeed, if history is a guide, a downward correction is a must before the market takes off on its next binge, as a large, still optimistic group of market professionals think it will. **********To be sure, the recent selloff is based on more than just the jitters. A big rise in interest rates in the last two months has suddenly made investments in money market accounts or such fixed-income securities as Treasury bills, notes and bonds look very attractive. The higher rates are caused in large part by the need to attract foreign investors to buy the Treasury securities that are sold to pay for the country's budget deficit. **********A continued rise in rates, of course, would take its toll on the economy as businesses and consumers slowed their spending. And there is the chance that this could occur if foreign investors demand higher rates to offset a further decline in the value of the dollar, which has already dropped more than 30 percent in the last two years. **********But one driving force that is often behind rising rates is not present nowadays: In the early 1980's, the country was thrown into an economic recession because high interest rates stifled business and consumer spending. Those high rates were necessary, the Federal Reserve Board believed, to curb double-digit inflation, but inflation now appears to be in check. **********To a certain extent, the selloff of late has been a case of easy come, easy go. Analysts point out that for the most part investors who have bought and held stocks since the start of the year are still impressively ahead. **********Hard as it may be to remember, at the start of the year the Dow Jones industrial average was around 1,900, which means that yesterday's close of 2,246.73 still represents a gain of more than 18 percent for the year. And in the last five years, the Dow has risen more than 250 percent. Yesterday's decline of 4.6 percent brought the total drop to 17.5 percent since the Dow hit its high of 2,722.42 on Aug. 25. **********Although there was little evidence that individuals were unloading shares by the bushel at any point this week, analysts said there could well be some increase in retail selling early next week. But at the same time, they pointed out that the big drop in stock prices and positive economic fundamentals make stocks look attractive. **********''If fundamentals count any more, there is still a lot of value out there,'' said Greg A. Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''This is the kind of thing everybody wanted to see: a sharp correction to a classic bull market. Now we have it.'' A Closer Look at Bonds Burton Malkiel, whose book ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'' argues that the stock market is unpredictable in the short run, and a professor of management at Yale University's School of Organization and Management, agreed with other analysts. He said he saw little or no evidence that inflation is about to surge or that the economy is about to go into a recession, a development that is often preceded by sagging stock prices. Still, he said the recent run-up in interest rates makes bonds an attractive alternative to stocks. **********''Rational portfolio allocation would suggest at this stage of the game to take a very close look at the bond market,'' he said. **********Reflecting that view, Merrill Lynch, the nation's biggest brokerage, said late yesterday that its strategists had made a modest change in their asset allocation recommendation to all clients. Stocks and Bonds Evenly Split **********Because of the rise in interest rates, the firm said it was now advocating an increase in the bond portion of its model portfolio to 40 percent, from 35 percent, and a reduction in the stock portion to 40 percent, from 45 percent. The firm's recommendation that 20 percent should stay in cash and securities, such as short-term Treasury bills, was unchanged from its earlier recommendations. **********''With long-term bond yields in the 10 percent range, bonds are likely to do equally well as stocks on a total return basis,'' said Charles I. Clough, Merrill's chief investment strategist. **********A spot check of stockbrokers around the nation yesterday disclosed that while clients were testy, few had chosen to get out of the stock market. Indeed, a number said that some investors were selectively buying stocks they now saw as bargains. Investing Is a Cold Exercise **********One partial reason for individuals' tranquillity in face of the market's nose dive could be the technical, institutional exercise that investing in the market has become. **********''I don't feel that the public ever really got into this market,'' said Bob Berry, the assistant branch manager of Paine Webber's downtown Dallas office. ''There hasn't been any panic, and we haven't seen a tremendous amount of shifting into fixed-income assets like money market accounts.'' **********William Cook, a vice president and retail broker with Merrill Lynch in Washington, said that computer-driven program selling of the type that has dominated the last two days ''is unemotional, but it breeds a lot of emotion.'' **********''My clients are testy, but they are not selling out,'' Mr. Cook added. ''If I had bought bonds for them two months ago to get safe, I would be worse off.'' **********James B. Cloonan, chairman of the American Association of Individual Investors, noted that short-term jitters, however understandable, are counterproductive to the strategy of most individual investors, who generally hold stocks and bonds for the long term. **********''I don't know what the individual investor can do except plan for the long term and keep a balanced investment strategy in place,'' Mr. Cloonan said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/11/world/3-die-as-police-clash-with-protesters-in-bangladesh.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1987-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 706, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Die as Police Clash With Protesters in Bangladesh", "print_headline": "3 Die as Police Clash With Protesters in Bangladesh", "body_text": " **********At least three people were shot and killed by the police here today as thousands of rioters set fire to cars and buildings, and threw bricks and homemade bombs in an attempt to force President H.

The actual number of protesters was in the tens of thousands at most. **********In addition to outlawing demonstrations, the Government had closed Dhaka University and shut down incoming bus, rail and ferry transportation. Opposition Vows to Fight On **********The opposition parties vowed to continue their drive until President Ershad was forced from office, but Government officials predicted that it would abate as many protests had in the past. **********''The myth has been exploded,'' asserted M. A. Matin, the Home Minister and a close aide to the President. ''They were supposed to force the Government to resign. They couldn't. The so-called siege degenerated into an act of anarchy, vandalism, arson and an attempt to create civil disorder.'' **********Leaders of the main opposition parties said the attacks on their members were unprovoked. They called for a nationwide protest strike Wednesday and Thursday. **********''He will have to resign,'' Khaleda Zia Rahman, the leader of a coalition of seven opposition parties, said of the President. ''It is a matter of time. We will be out in the streets tomorrow and the day after until he goes.'' **********The opposition said a total of six people, not three as the Government said, had died from police gunfire. But the report was impossible to verify because the police had taken possession of the bodies. Nearby hospitals reported two people with gunshot wounds and dozens of others with injuries from the rioting. **********The opposition said dozens were wounded by gunfire. A Turbulent History **********Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most densely populated countries, has had a history of natural disasters, riots, assassinations, coups and coup attempts since it broke from Pakistan to become an independent nation in 1971. **********President Ershad was the army's Chief of Staff when he seized power in 1982; he was elected President last October in a day of voting marked by charges of fraud. **********Anti-Government parties renewed agitation against President Ershad last summer, culminating in 3 days of strikes in which 10 people were killed. But protests subsided when Bangladesh was hit by the worst floods in 40 years. **********This fall, the opposition tried to revive the protest drive with what it termed a siege of the capital. The authorities reported arresting more than 1,100 people for political activities in the last few days; the opposition said the number was more than 5,000. **********An unusual aspect of these protests was the unity among political parties of all ideologies, except for the ruling National Party of President Ershad. Anatomy of a Protest **********The day began peacefully, with small groups marching noisily through the downtown area, occasionally broken up by riot police officers wielding clubs and shields or firing tear gas. By mid-morning, demonstrators were throwing bricks and homemade bombs, and the police were firing back with blanks. **********The police later resorted to bullets in ''self-defense,'' Government officials said; opposition spokesmen said the firing was unprovoked."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/22/business/advertising-a-mobile-pizza-hut-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 739, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; A Mobile Pizza Hut Campaign", "print_headline": "Advertising; A Mobile Pizza Hut Campaign", "body_text": " **********AS a method of communicating what it considers its myriad strongpoints synergistically and within a single advertising campaign, Pizza Hut, the largest chain in the fastest-growing facet of the restaurant business, has borrowed a concept from Charles Kuralt of CBS-TV and has taken to the road. **********The Los Angeles office of Chiat/ Day, Pizza Hut's agency for the last couple of years, has prepared a comparatively huge pool of 30 spots for the first four months of the campaign, which will start running on network and spot TV tonight. **********They star Rich Hall, a young comedian who, aboard his mobile home labeled ''Pizza Hut Mobile Institute For Pizza Studies,'' is traveling the roads of middle America seeking answers to such compelling questions as ''Which is your favorite Pizza Hut delight, and why ?'' **********Favorite products include such trademarked items as the Priazzo, a double-crusted pizza pie, and the Calizza, which was inspired by the calzone. Since the strength of the Pepsico subsidiary is away from the Italian-American population centers, it is quite free to make things up as it goes along without fear of any outrage from the purists. **********Other favorites that the man in the street will be voting for are the traditional pizza, which is called thin and crispy; the deep-dish pan pizza, and the personal pan pizza, intended for the lunchtime crowd and guaranteed to be served within five minutes or you get another pie free. **********Although all the commercials supply some image-like promotion, most also stress a particular product so that local advertising associations can promote individual dishes. The local groups will place the ads though their own agencies while Chiat/Day arranges the national support. **********This first phase of the campaign will be backed by $50 million in national and local ad dollars. **********The interviews that make up the commercials use local residents who have been screened by Chiat/Day casting people. The spots were shot in Chicago; Normal, Ill.; Benton Harbor, Mich.; Chattanooga, Tenn., and Rome, Ga. (as close to anything Italian as they get), as well as on the road in Floyd County, Ga., and in Pell City, Ala. **********But before the campaign settles into its voice-of-the-people phase, it will have four days of nothing but introductory spots in which Mr. Hall will explain his mission. **********Then there will be four weeks of a special traffic-building promotion during which customers will be asked to vote (using specially printed place mats) for their favorite Pizza Hut food.

Ropes, vice president advertising-media of Pizza Hut, who was in from his Wichita, Kan., headquarters visiting with Jay Chiat yesterday, home delivery and frozen pizza are the fastest-growing part of the $12 billion pizza market. **********As far as fast food, generally, he said that traffic - and therefore sales - was either flat or down over all. That means that in each category - pizza, hamburgers or chicken -battles for customers have been raging for the last year and a half. **********''Too many seats, not enough people,'' said Robert Wolf, executive vice president and general manager of Chiat/Day, New York. **********Pizza Hut, Mr. Ropes said, has more than 5,000 outlets in the United States and half of them are company owned. It is the country's third-largest restaurant chain, he said, born in America's heartland, where it has flourished. **********Up to now, the chain has made a poor showing on the two coasts, particularly in the East, where mom-and-pop pizza places dominate. In Boston and on Long Island a number of stores were opened, and then closed.

Otherwise, sales of all dynamic random access memory chips made by Samsung and all products using the chips would be banned in the United States. **********A high-ranking Samsung official in the United States, who asked not to be named, said he was certain that Samsung was close to settling the case with Texas Instruments and that Samsung would pay ''a considerable amount'' to avoid the product ban. He estimated Samsung's sales of dynamic random access memory chips in the United States at $70 million this year. Settlement Talks Confirmed **********In a statement, Texas Instruments confirmed that settlement talks with Samsung were in progress. Texas Instruments, the nation's largest semiconductor manufacturer, also said it would grant temporary licenses to the dozens of companies in the United States using Samsung chips. **********The ban includes circuit boards and equipment called single-in-line packages made by other companies that use D-RAM's made by Samsung with 64,000 or 256,000 characters of memory. It also covers computers, facsimile machines and certain telecommunications equipment and printers bearing either of the Samsung chips. **********Tim Yaworski, an assistant general counsel for the trade commission, in Washington, said the order was one of the strongest ever issued by the commission in a case involving patent infringement. He added that the investigation on charges brought by Texas Instruments, which also included complaints against eight Japanese chip manufactures, lasted 18 months and was the largest ever conducted by the commission. $138 Million in Payments Earlier this year, Texas Instruments announced that it had reached settlements with seven of the eight Japanese companies on complaints it first brought with the commission in January 1986. The agreements resulted in $138 million in royalty payments in the first half of 1987, the company said. **********Richard J. Agnich, vice president and general counsel for Texas Instruments, said the order today by the commission ''confirms the value of T.I.'s semiconductor technology.'' He added, ''It underscores the role intellectual property can play in providing an adequate return on research and development investment to technology innovators.'' **********Separately, Texas Instruments announced today that it had reached a pact with Japan's NEC Corporation for the two companies to license several of each other's chip patents. The pact called for Texas Instruments to drop charges against NEC that were filed with the commission. The company said the agreement was not expected to have a significant financial impact on Texas Instruments soon but that, in general, it represented ''a plus.'' **********Mr. Yaworski said the commission would deliver both its order and opinion on the Samsung ruling to President Reagan next week. Mr. Reagan then will have 60 days to decide whether to overrule the commission, allow the order to stand with no comment or endorse it. **********The Samsung executive said his company was not surprised by the commission's order because a commission administrative judge said in a preliminary finding last May that Samsung appeared to have violated Texas Instruments' patents in the two D-RAM chips. **********''If we could not reach any agreement with T.I., it would be severely damaging'' for Samsung, he said. **********Nevertheless, the officer expressed dismay at the order and asserted that it was the result of increasing sentiment within Congress to halt the stubborn trend of rising trade deficits in the United States. $7.6 Billion Surplus in 1986 Another company official said South Korea's trade surplus with the United States, at $7.6 billion last year, was modest compared with Japan's $34 billion surplus with the United States. He said Samsung and other major manufacturers in South Korea were acting to increase imports from the United States to reduce reliance on Japanese products and raw materials. **********''This exclusion will be a shock to Korean industry,'' the Samsung executive said. He added it would likely foment anti-American hostility among South Korean college students. ''The United States is demanding many things of Korea,'' he added. **********He said most American companies buying Samsung chips were too small to get much attention from Japanese suppliers. ''They also prefer the Samsung product because it is cheaper than the Japanese product,'' he said. About 80 percent of all D-RAM's sold in the United States are produced by Japanese and Korean manufacturers. **********Samsung's principal operations in the United States are sales offices in Fort Lee, N.J., and Los Angeles, as well as a chip manufacturing plant in San Jose, Calif., opened in 1983. **********Samsung is one of South Korea's three major multinational corporations, along with Daewoo and Hyundai."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/16/world/italy-opens-trial-in-airport-raid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 338, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Italy Opens Trial in Airport Raid", "print_headline": "Italy Opens Trial in Airport Raid", "body_text": " **********The only gunman who survived the attack on the Rome airport two years ago in which 16 people were killed went on trial today at the Rebibbia maximum-security prison. **********The survivor, Ibrahim Mohammed Khaled, is the only one of the three defendants in the trial who is in custody.

They lugged hampers of delicate nibbles and repasts, disembarking in tuxedos and fur capes past indifferent white sheep, placing their intermission Champagne to cool in the estate ponds and generally congratulating themselves for having the rare presence to wander the gardens and witness the opera blossoming on the 700-year-old estate. **********Other opera buffs of humbler means, tuxedoed and gowned nevertheless, came by family cars, arriving by dint of thrift - tickets cost up to $80 each - and persistence. The waiting list is unspecified years long for membership, which then allows a lottery-governed chance for the limited tickets to the 73 evenings of six different productions this summer. **********''We applied for membership in 1959 when we were engaged, and finally were accepted in 1966,'' said Priscilla Pode, a gentle, democratically toned opera lover who still had to wait a year to get tickets for this second and final cycle of ''Porgy.'' ''But the box office people are always wonderful,'' she added, careful not to offend. **********Derided when it was conceived 53 years ago, the Gyndebourne summer opera has come to prevail as perhaps the most exotic hybrid of England's social-show biz cynosures, one that can resist even black-market prices.

''Sometimes they get tipsy at their picnics and tend to giggle in the second half.'' **********This was hardly the case tonight as the audience was riveted, then on its feet for a standing ovation for ''Porgy,'' the performance bolstering the festival's reputation as a place of the highest standards where artists can invest weeks in rehearsals with some of the best directors and musicians of international opera. **********But for George Christie, the Glyndebourne chairman whose parents ingeniously converted the estate house into what is now a charitable trust, this is another summer of agonizing over the ''voracious and relentlesss quest'' for tickets. #250 More Seats Considered And so he is considering providing another dipperful of room for the ocean of demands by adding 250 seats to the splendid 830-seat theater. ''There is a point,'' he said, ''when, if you can't respond to demand, you are at the risk of creating needless chagrin and disenchantment.'' **********Perish that thought tonight as Glyndebourne's happy few fairly danced out onto the lawns for the 75-minute dinner break, humming Gershwin, popping Dom Perignon. **********In the cool English evening after the final curtain, chauffeurs stowed the portable tables and silver candle sticks and gowned guests disturbed the nearby sheep one more time with their limousine departures.

Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, questioned Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter yesterday over the admiral's testimony and that of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. Following are excerpts of that exchange: **********Q. Perhaps inevitably, the record is filled with conflicts in your testimony with that of Colonel North. I'd like to mention just a few of those that I deem important, and then I want to ask you first whether or not I have accurately summarized your aspect of the testimony, and then I want to ask you about the resolution of those. **********Most significant in my view is that Colonel North testified that he prepared and sent to you five memos which included references to the diversion of funds to the contras from the Iran arms sale, each of which specifically asked you to brief the President and obtain his approval. You have said that you cannot recall seeing those memos except possibly the one that survived. Indeed, just a short while ago, in response to a question by Mr. Rodino, you said you didn't think the other four memos ever existed. **********A. Senator, I listened to Colonel North's testimony quite carefully, because for one thing I knew that he would be aware of details that I was not and so to help fill in the full picture I thought that was important. I don't recall him testifying that positively that there were indeed five. That conclusion was jumped at by several members of the committee, but I don't think you will find in there any very positive statement. **********Q. Now Colonel North testified that on Nov. 21 he assured you that he had gotten rid of all of the memos referring to the diversion, whatever their number, and you say that you cannot recall any such conversation. **********You testified at your deposition that you instructed Colonel North not to put anything in writing concerning the diversion. Colonel North denied that you gave him any such instruction, and he further testified that had he received such an instruction from you, he would not have prepared and sent several separate memos - I have five in mind, but whatever number - for briefing the President and obtaining his approval. **********Colonel North testified that you were aware that the chronologies prepared in November 1986 were false. You have said that you were unaware of any deliberate falsification. **********Colonel North testified that at the meeting on Nov. 20 to prepare testimony for Mr. Casey to give to Congress that you know as well as he did that the testimony was wrong. **********Colonel North testified that his PROF note to McFarlane in which he spoke of your request to him to prepare a memo for the President referred to the one surviving memo which mentions the diversion. You've said that it didn't. **********Colonel North testified that he told you no later than Nov. 21 that he had destroyed documents. You've said that he didn't. **********Colonel North testified that he discussed with Mr. Casey, Mr. McFarlane and with you what Mr. Casey originally called and what Colonel North testified as the fall-guy plan. You've denied any such discussion.  Colonel North testified that on Nov. 21 he asked you whether you had told the President of the diversion and you said you had not. You cannot recall any such conversation. **********Now obviously human memory is such that different people can and frequently do recall the same events differently, particularly with respect to minor details. But as the number and importance of conflict in testimony increase, so also does the likelihood that someone is not telling the truth. Now before I ask a question about these conflicts, if I have misstated your testimony in any way in this summary it was inadvertent, and I want to give you the opportunity to correct it before I ask a question about it. **********A. I think you have misstated my position in several aspects. **********Q. In which respect? Why don't you state what would be the correct reference? I've got the transcript references here. Why don't you go ahead and state in what respects you feel that I have? **********A. Well, Senator, I think this tactic of quoting what Colonel North said and quoting what I've said without -they're not direct quotes, they're your interpretations of what I said - is a highly unfair way to do it. As you pointed out, people have different recollections. I've told you things that I can't recall. I'm not saying that Colonel North didn't tell me those things on the 21st. I simply don't recall it. Q. Well, that's what I said.  A. And I don't think that necessarily is a conflict just because I can't remember it. I don't think I said that the April memo wasn't prepared as a result - or it wasn't the memo that Colonel North referred to in the one PROF note. It may very well have been. I just simply don't recall seeing it then, and it isn't fair even to describe that memo as requesting the President to approve the transfer of funds. That's in a different section of the memo. The memo was asking for me to get the President's approval on the first part of the memo. That part about the transfer of funds is in a background section. It's pretty clear to me that when Colonel North wrote that, he understood that was approved, and it was a reminder to me that that amount of money in his view would be available to be transferred to fullfill the objective that I had approved back in February of 1986. **********Q. It is difficult - at least for me, and I speak for no one else - to reconcile that Colonel North's testimony that he prepared five of these, one for each transaction. He was quite certain in that there were five proposed transactions, some of which did not go through, and he sent them forward for approval. And that you can't recall even seeing them. Is there any way that we can reconcile that in your mind? **********A. Senator, I think you have in exhibits memoranda that Colonel North prepared for various phases of the operation. Those exist. They don't say anything about diversion. I have told you that I don't recall seeing any of the memos until the 25th. I did see the one that survived. I very likely could have seen that in April. I simply don't recall seeing it. **********And the one thing I'm positive about and the thing that's important to you is that I made a decision in February of 1986 not to ask the President or tell him about this proposal. I decided to approve that on my own. **********I made a very deliberate decision not to tell him and frankly whether the memos existed or didn't exist, I frankly don't think they did, I think that Colonel North may be mistaken on that point. He prepared, as you know, an awful lot of papers, probably more than any other staff officer on the N.S.C. staff, and out of all those papers I think he simply has forgotten."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/business/company-news-telex-extension.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Telex Extension", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Telex Extension", "body_text": " **********The investor Asher B.

''As long as there is that aggression, you cannot ask Nicaragua to democratize.'' After first opposing the accord, President Reagan has supported it with open skepticism and the proviso that more contra aid will be sought to maintain pressure on the Sandinista Government. Demands Called Unrealistic **********The question of whether the accord will actually produce an end to the decades of Central American violence and discord, Mr. Arias said, depends less on the five signatory nations and more on whether there will be cooperation from the United States, the Soviet Union and Cuba. Analyzing the current problems of the accord, President Arias said the rebels in both Nicaragua and El Salvador had made unrealistic demands in the early peace negotiating process. ''They ask for too much in order to give concessions later on,'' he said, adding as his advice: ''Ask for less. Be more realistic so that agreement would be much easier to reach.'' **********''The first priority should be a truce until the 16th of January, after the end of the meeting of the five Presidents in Costa Rica,'' he said. He referred to a progress report on the accord to be heard in San Jose by himself and the leaders of the other accord nations, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Savador and Honduras. **********''I haven't been able to succeed with my recommendation of a truce,'' the President conceded. ''Perhaps the main obstacle is a little bit of intransigence, a little bit of inflexibility, of intolerance'' by the contending forces, he said. 'Ball Is Still Rolling' **********Mr. Arias said he did not feel that the accord process lost its initial momentum once the attempts at negotiation failed to make early progress. ''The ball is still rolling,'' he said. ''I am only complaining perhaps it is not rolling fast enough.'' **********''We all know if we fail now, war will continue,'' he declared. **********The 46-year-old President confirmed that he intended to use the Nobel award of $340,000 to form a foundation to aid the neediest people in his nation, which, he noted, has been exceptional in Central America in not maintaining an army and in pursuing democratic government and such social advancements as free compulsory education and universal medical care. **********Mr. Arias praised President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbechev, the Soviet leader, for the latest nuclear disarmament agreement. ''This is an unforgettable event in recent history,'' he said, while declining to immediately nominate them for the next Nobel Peace Prize. ''Let's see what happens in the months ahead,'' he declared. **********Asked about Nicaraguan charges that a recently captured American was a contra mercenary using Costa Rica as a haven, Mr. Arias said ''it's very difficult to believe'' because his Government had a policy of deporting such people. If necessary, he said, he would ''very strongly protest'' to any outside country trying to use Costa Rica in the regional conflicts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/25/world/child-sex-scandal-roils-unicef-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1987-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 468, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHILD SEX SCANDAL ROILS UNICEF UNIT", "print_headline": "CHILD SEX SCANDAL ROILS UNICEF UNIT", "body_text": " **********The head of the United Nations Children's Fund in Belgium resigned today after the disclosure of a child pornography case linked to the Belgian branch of the organization. **********A spokesman at Unicef headquarters in Geneva said the head of the organization's Belgian committee, Gilbert Jaeger, had resigned ''to show how angry he is about what has happened in his organization.'' **********In a statement issued in Geneva, Unicef said it is ''deeply shocked'' by the scandal, which has led to 14 arrests in Belgium and others in Switzerland, France and Britain. **********Unicef said it was investigating charges that the Belgian committee was linked to an organization producing pornographic photographs of children and distributing them throughout Europe. **********Unicef's mission is to help and protect the world's children.

And Government officials, although repeating their belief that the tariffs were unjustified and a violation of trade rules, stressed the importance of the overall United States-Japan relationship. **********''I do not think this is a trade war,'' said Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Hajime Tamura. **********''Basically,'' he said, ''America and Japan are the most friendly nations'' in the world. He and other top officials, including Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, pledged to work for swift repeal of the tariffs. Repeal of Tariffs Expected **********Indeed, one reason for the lack of polemics appears to be Japanese confidence that the tariffs will not remain in effect long. Officials say they will soon have statistical proof that they are complying with the semiconductor agreement at the heart of the trade dispute. The United States has charged that Japan has failed to stop selling semiconductors at low prices in overseas markets and has failed to open its markets to American-made chips. **********Mr. Tamura told reporters today that Japan had decided against retaliating immediately because he hopes that his meetings next week with the United States Trade Representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, can lead to an early settlement of the dispute. Japanese officials are also working on a separate package of trade measures that Mr. Nakasone will bring with him when he visits Washington on April 29. **********To many Japanese, indeed, the tariffs are symbolic. Although Japanese manufacturers registered strong protests today, and although it is clear that the tariffs will hurt exports of specific products, it is unlikely that $300 million worth of tariffs will deal much of a blow to an industry that exported, by Japanese statistics, $21 billion of products to the United States last year. **********Moreover, despite rumblings from Congress about further trade legislation, it appears that many Japanese do not think the United States would be able to shut Japan completely out of the American market. U.S. Said to Need the Trade **********''I think there is some feeling on the part of Japanese that the Americans will no longer be able to do without money or products from Japan,'' said Masahiko Ishizuka, editor of the English-language edition of The Japan Economic Journal. ''This feeling might prove wrong, but it leads to an expectation that the United States will stop somewhere in avoiding a total trade war.'' **********In some quarters, however, the American action has prompted calls for a re-examination of Japanese corporate behavior and trade practices. Yomiuri Shimbun, a leading daily newspaper that often reflects the thinking of the Nakasone administration, said in an editorial this morning: ''The root of the problem is within Japanese corporations, which drive themselves into excessive competition and into obtaining market shares even at the expense of profits. If this situation goes unchanged, Japan is bound to encounter one trade dispute after another with the U.S. and other countries.'' **********A managing director of McKinsey & Company who often writes on trade issues, Kenichi Ohmae, said that although American companies needed to try harder in the Japanese market, Japanese corporate practices were also at fault. In particular, he pointed to the fierce competition between Japanese companies that causes each company to rush to match investments made by its competitors. The result, in cars, shipbuilding and now semiconductors, has been overcapacity, falling prices and trade tensions. 'We Can Be a Menace' **********''It's a kamikaze mentality - if you fail when others fail, it is not considered a shame,'' he said. ''We have to come to grips with this, otherwise we will continue to produce tragedies. We have to realize that we can be a menace to the rest of the world, without any intention on Japan's part to do so.'' **********Government officials often say that American pressure can help to persuade vested interests in Japan to give in. And, with reservations, some Japanese said a tough American policy might prove effective. **********''To some extent this tactic works,'' Mr. Ishizuka said, adding, ''What's lacking in Japanese policy is to take action before being forced to do so.'' **********An endless round of trade sanctions or particularly vituperative criticism from Congress could hurt Japanese pride, Government officials said. **********''If you're slapped on your face,'' a senior Government official said, ''would you be willing to offer your other cheek to be slapped?'' **********Yet Mr. Ishizuka said he thought pragmatism would prevail. ''In the back of their minds, anti-American feeling might be brewing,'' he said. ''But Japanese are very well aware that without the American market, Japan's economy will be in serious trouble.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/19/business/subdued-financing-activity-is-seen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 585, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Subdued Financing Activity Is Seen", "print_headline": "Subdued Financing Activity Is Seen", "body_text": " **********The Treasury securities market will be closed today, and analysts expect that activity in the corporate, tax-exempt and financial futures markets will be subdued until a full complement of traders and investors returns tommorow. **********Because of the holiday, the Treasury's regular Monday sale of new three- and six-month bills will be held tomorrow.

To present its version of events, Iran this week allowed a handful of foreign journalists to visit Teheran for five days. **********The journalists were promised interviews with returning pilgrims, some of them wounded, and with medical personnel and Government officials. **********Arab support for Saudi Arabia in the crisis may have persuaded Teheran to publicize its version of events, both diplomatically and by inviting Western journalists to Teheran. **********The relentless theme of the Iranian Government remains that the Saudi Government is linked directly to the United States and that the two acted jointly in Mecca. **********So slogans at the Saudi Embassy, under police guard, declare: ''Down with the U.S.A. Down with King Fahd. The Government is American,'' according to an English-speaking Iranian who provided a translation. **********At Friday prayer service, Iran's President, Hojatolislam Ali Khamenei, urged the nation not to seek revenge by attacking embassies. **********''The Government is trying to keep this issue warm but not hot, to play it to some advantage,'' said an Iranian journalist, sipping tea in the lobby of the Laleh International Hotel, formerly the Inter-Continental. The new name means Tulip, a symbol of martyrdom. Iranian Consults in Oman **********On the diplomatic front, Iran dispatched Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati to Oman for talks on the situation in the Persian Gulf and on the Mecca violence. In Iranian eyes the two are closely linked. **********At the Kuwaiti Embassy, every window is broken, furniture is overturned and 14 liquor bottles are prominently displayed on a lower balcony, silently rebuking the Kuwaitis for violation of Islam's ban on alcohol. **********A banner proclaims the position that Kuwait invited the superpowers into the Persian Gulf and hence Iran has taken the embassy. **********A witness told of observing from a distance as a crowd of civilians mixed with Revolutionary Guards stormed the embassy the morning after the Mecca violence. **********''They threw safes out the window, where there was by accident a truck waiting,'' said the witness. **********At the Saudi Embassy, there was ''very tough fighting'' by guards but they were overwhelmed, he said. The Arab diplomats were at first detained but then were put under house arrest, where they remain. Release of Diplomats Sought **********Saudi Arabia and Iran are reportedly negotiating the release of the diplomats, but both sides have refused to give them free movement. **********According to the Western diplomat, four Saudi diplomats and four Kuwaitis are being detained. He said he knew nothing of reports that a Saudi diplomat was missing or hospitalized. **********At the French Embassy, where 11 people, including five diplomats and dependents, are trapped in a diplomatic dispute, there were two banners in French. **********''France will soon taste the bitter taste of its meanness,'' said one. The other read: ''The origin of the moral war in the Persian Gulf is based in the United States. And France and England are standing beside them.'' **********The British Embassy has been deserted because of the break in relations between the two nations. A Swedish diplomat is there as caretaker. Italy has raised its flag over the French Embassy and opened an interest section there. U.S. Embassy Now a School **********Elsewhere in Teheran, at the United States Embassy, now a religious school where militants are said to study, one slogan in English reads: ''The superpowers' law of veto is worse than the law of the jungle.'' **********This seems to be a reference to American and Soviet veto power in the United Nations Security Council. **********Knocking at a side door and presenting press passes issued by the Ministry of Islamic Guidance, three American reporters were let inside the embassy walls briefly. **********Armed and uniformed young men smiled and let them sit in a cool guard house. ''Did you come here by mistake?'' one asked. They spoke little English. **********Later the guards allowed the reporters to walk just inside the front gate but no further. School was out, one said, suggesting another visit the next day.  U.S. WARNS EMBASSIES **********WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 (Special to The New York Times) - The State Department has issued a warning to United States embassies throughout the world urging American officials to be on alert for Iranian terrorist activity, a department spokesman said today. **********In a statement, the State Department said, ''Iran has been stepping up its extremist rhetoric against the United States and has shown a past willingness to engage in terrorist attacks. We are taking precautions.'' **********The warning was issued during the last week, a department spokesman said, amid heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf. **********Today's statement was issued after The Los Angeles Times reported in its Saturday editions that Charles E.

The hospital is equivalent to Walter Reed Army Hospital in the United States. **********The source said Mr. Hu was ''distraught'' by the decision to remove him from the party leadership on Jan. 16 after a monthlong wave of pro-democracy demonstrations by students. **********Mr. Hu, who was allowed to retain his seat on the standing committee of the Politburo, the ruling council of the party, has not appeared in public since late December and has not been mentioned in the Chinese press since his resignation. **********There has still been no public explanation for Mr. Hu's political demise, and the turmoil surrounding it has yet to subside. **********Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang was named acting general secretary of the party to replace Mr. Hu, but many basic policies set forth since 1979 by China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, for implementation by Mr. Hu and Mr. Zhao appear to be in doubt. Hints of Challenge to Deng **********That doubt arises, some Western diplomats say, because it is unclear who is now exerting power within the party. It has been assumed that Mr. Deng was unscathed by the political upheaval, but the increasing prominence of hard-line party members suggests at least some challenge to his leadership, according to the diplomats. **********There have been recurring articles in national newspapers questioning some basic features of the economic measures designed to stimulate the economy with market mechanisms and private initiative rather than relying on rigid state planning and control. **********Mr. Zhao has insisted that these policies, as well as China's opening to the West, will continue, but the widely trumpeted campaign last summer to extricate the party from daily government, which Mr. Hu pushed aggressively, now appears to be dead. **********One of the targets of the party hard-liners has been four coastal ''special economic zones,'' where many restrictions on imports, exports, and access to foreign currency have been eased. Conservatives viewed these zones, which Mr. Deng created to attract foreign investment and technology, as centers for the infiltration of Western values. Campaign Against Journalist **********Meanwhile, China's Government-controlled press has systematically begun to discredit the investigative reporting of Liu Binyan, a popular journalist who was expelled from the Communist Party two weeks ago. **********The attacks on the articles by Mr. Liu, who became best known for exposing corruption inside the Communist Party, appear designed to subdue independent enterprise by Chinese journalists and to shield the party from public investigations into illegal activity by its local officials. **********Mr. Liu's reports uncovered abuses of power by local party secretaries, extortion, bribery, intimidation of intellectuals and persecution of ordinary people. **********The daily newspaper in Heilongjiang Province, where Mr. Liu did his most celebrated investigative reporting, charged that the journalist wanted his profession to ''become the third force next only to Government and Parliament, just as in Western countries.'' **********The January issue of The Literary Review went on sale with an article by Mr. Liu torn out of each issue and his name blacked out on the magazine's title page. **********After he was expelled from the party two weeks ago, The Shaanxi Daily denounced Mr. Liu on its front page for attacking the party. The provincial paper in northern China charged that his reporting ''meddled in the work of grass-roots party organizations and disrupted the public. By wagging his tongue too freely, he often blackened the situation.'' **********The ferocity of the attacks on Mr. Liu appear aimed at undermining his popularity.

In that respect they differ from ''golden parachutes,'' which assure only that a company's top executives would receive benefits should they lose their jobs as the result of an unfriendly acquisition. Golden Parachutes in Place **********Even before it adopted the tin parachute last month, Irving already had in place golden parachutes for 13 of its top executives. According to its filing with the S.E.C., the number of employees covered by golden parachutes was increased to 49 earlier this month. **********Although the use of golden parachutes has become widespread, tin parachutes are still rare. Other companies using the device include Mobil, Accuray, America West Airlines and Herman Miller Inc. of Zeeland, Mich. **********In the Bank of New York's attempt to take over Irving with its 10,200 employees, the costs could be substantial because most analysts believe that the acquisition might make sense only if the Bank of New York were to dismiss many employees after a merger. And the Bank of New York has done that in the past. **********When it took over the Long Island Trust Company earlier this year, for example, the Bank of New York laid off about 400 people, or about a third of the Long Island bank's staff. In addition, the Bank of New York gave the dismissed employees so little compensation that Long Island Trust's former owner, a large Italian bank, voluntarily increased the payments out of its own resources. Terms of Program **********Under Irving's program, dismissed employees would receive, in a lump sum, a minimum of one month's base salary for each year of service. But no employee would receive more than two years' base salary. Employees with a base salary of at least $40,000, however, would receive at least six months' base salary, and those earning at least $60,000 would receive at least a full year's base salary. **********The payments would be due whether the employee is dimissed or if he decides to quit after suffering a pay cut or a substantial reduction in duties. It would not apply if an employee were dismssed with cause. **********It remains unclear whether tin parachute plans such as Irving's would be upheld in court.

Yet those familiar with the workings of Washington know that no issue is ever permanently resolved. There will, in fact, almost certainly be fresh tax legislation this year. **********''I have yet to see a Congress that was unwilling to tinker,'' said Gerald W. Padwe, national director of tax policy for Touche Ross & Company. ''They're always looking at something to fix.'' **********The new Speaker of the House, Jim Wright of Texas, did not even wait for the new law to take effect to suggest that tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals should be deferred. This prompted a counter effort by Republicans, which proved unsuccessful, to amend the House rules to bar any increase in tax rates - or a delay in cuts - for two years. **********But just what Congress will do on taxes this year is, as usual, highly uncertain. While big changes seem unlikely, Congressional aides, accountants and lobbyists are warning taxpayers that they must continue to pay close attention if they are to avoid potentially costly errors. **********Frank O'Connell, who follows legislation for Laventhol & Horwath, a large accounting firm, says that while he and his colleagues continue to recommend deferring as much income as possible until 1988, when rates are to be still lower, ''We are certainly cautioning our clients'' of the possibility that Mr. Wright's proposal will be adopted. **********''That 28 percent rate might not be there,'' said Mr. O'Connell, referring to that part of the law that chops the highest bracket to 38.5 percent this year (from 50 percent in 1986) and to 28 percent next January. **********The fact that many politically powerful sectors of the economy - including the real estate and insurance industries and the small-business community - lost important ground in the 1986 legislation means that even the most innocuous bill this year could be transformed into a vehicle loaded with contentious, special-interest amendments. **********Once the legislative process has begun, said Mark A. Bloomfield of the American Council for Capital Formation, ''the whole thing can explode.'' **********This is one reason that there is little urgency about getting started on the routine business of passing a so-called technical corrections bill to rectify the hundreds of mostly minor drafting errors in the 1986 act - with more being found each week. **********Although Congress tried to get this job done last fall - and committee negotiators from each chamber came close to agreement four days before the President signed the tax overhaul legislation itself - the fear of bogging down in debate over substantive issues has put technical corrections well down on the list of priorities. **********Such ''substance'' could be such obviously important ''added starter'' amendments as a measure to restore preferential treatment for capital gains. Or it could be a lower-order but probably controversial item, such as grandfathering the investment tax credit for purchasers of small airplanes built in Kansas, Florida, Georgia and Texas. **********What is to be considered ''technical,'' in other words, is what a majority of Congress says is technical. **********In any event, passing even a corrections bill ''won't happen until the middle of the year at the earliest,'' predicts a Senate aide. Adds Mr. Bloomfield, ''No one I know of is rushing.'' Another uncertainty is just what approach will be taken by Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who has replaced Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican, as head of the Senate Finance Committee. **********Although Senator Bentsen has said he expects only technical corrections legislation this year, there are signs that he may be receptive to ''doing something'' for the real estate industry, perhaps the biggest loser under the new law. **********Some of the problems in the 1986 act will be worked out by the staff of the Joint Tax Committee, which is producing its formal explanation of the law that will be published, probably in April, in what is called its Blue Book. The principal standard for inclusion in this document is that there must be general agreement among all Congressional parties about the intent of a particular provision. **********Another reason for going slow on tax legislation this year is simply that Congress will in all likelihood be preoccupied with other things, particularly trade legislation and the related, suddenly hot issue of the nation's international competitiveness. **********It will also be spending long hours on the budget, and it is this issue, many believe, that will provide the impetus for any serious revisions of last year's Tax Reform Act. **********Deficit-reduction targets will be hard to achieve in the most optimistic of circumstances, these specialists maintain, and should the economy falter, this would both cut the Treasury's tax take and raise outlays for unemployment and other programs. **********In this situation, a need for revenues could unleash efforts to do something ambitious: perhaps cigarette or other excise taxes, an oil import fee, a broad-based consumption tax or even adjustments to the Social Security system. **********All these things, however, are long-shots since the economy seems likely to continue to show respectable growth and because President Reagan remains adamantly opposed to any tax increase, apart from the $20 billion or so of additional revenue he has proposed in his 1988 budget. **********One likely substantive ''fix,'' however, will be substantially to repeal a provision in the new law granting vast new tax benefits to estates that contribute to employee stock ownership plans, or ESOP's. **********Whatever happens, however, there seems to be almost no chance that the newly-enacted basic tax rates themselves - 15 and 28 percent for individuals and 34 percent for corporations -will be raised before the next President takes office in 1989. **********''I do not think there is going to be any significant erosion of what was done last year,'' asserted an aide to Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat who was a principal architect of the 1986 law. ''I'm confident that the rate reductions scheduled to take effect in 1987 and 1988 will indeed become effective.'' **********A less visibly partisan Congressional operative, a staff member of the Joint Tax Committee, agreed: ''I don't think very much will happen at all this year,'' he declared. When asked what advice he had for taxpayers now planning their strategies, he added: ''I'd assume that the '86 Act is going to be around for a while.''  PROPOSED CHANGES IN TAX LAW  Among the changes that members of Congress have proposed be included in a ''technical corrections bill,'' to the tax act are:  * Easing the tax-exempt bond arbitrage penalties for localities issuing and rolling over short-term notes.  * Allowing taxpayers with deposits in insolvent financial institutions to deduct their full losses.  * Expanding a transition rule that exempts deep discount bond income earned by 15 large life insurance companies from repeal of the preferential 28 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains.  * Expanding a transition rule that allows purchasers of private aircraft made in Kansas, Florida, Texas and Georgia to take the investment tax credit.  * Allowing deductions for charitable donations to the University of Texas and Louisiana State University made in exchange for preferential seating at sporting events.  * Allowing steel companies to get partial refunds for unused investment tax credits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/31/business/company-news-microsoft-buys-software-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Microsoft Buys Software Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Microsoft Buys Software Unit", "body_text": " **********The Microsoft Corporation announced its first significant software acquisition today, paying $14 million for Forethought Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif. **********Forethought makes a program called Powerpoint that allows users of Apple Macintosh computers to make overhead transparencies or flip charts.

This would require American military personnel to operate from Pakistani territory, according to the Administration officials. **********But Pakistani officials assured Washington that the planes would not fly over Afghanistan and that the Americans would be safe. Could Avoid Congress **********By leasing the planes, Pakistan also would avoid a fight in Congress, where members opposed to American military aid on the ground that Pakistan is developing nuclear weapons would try to prevent the sale. India, which opposes Pakistan getting any planes for fear they might be used against India, is expected to react negatively to any lease arrangement. **********Administration officials agree that Pakistan urgently needs an air defense system, but said today that even if a decision was made immediately to lease the planes, it would take several months to put a system in place. These officials said they were still studying the Pakistani request and that no decision had been made. **********An American-Pakistani team that analyzed Pakistan's needs last year outlined several options. They included providing the Pakistanis with the E-3A Sentry, a modified Boeing 707 also known as Awacs; or the E-2C Hawkeye, a less-sophisticated and much cheaper plane, officials said. **********From certain areas of Pakistan, either plane would be able to detect flights taking off from Kabul, although the Awacs has a wider range, American officials said. **********The Pakistani request came in a letter dated April 16 from Prime Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo to President Reagan, A copy was given to Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, Republican of New Hampshire, during his recent visit to Pakistan. Although the letter has not been formally presented to President Reagan, a copy was forwarded to the State Department. **********In his letter, Mr. Junejo said there was an ''extremely urgent'' need for the American early warning system and asked President Reagan to consider leasing surveillance planes ''as soon as possible, preferably within a month or so.'' **********The letter did not say what type of radar plane Pakistan wanted, but Pakistani officials have said they prefer the Awacs. **********Pakistan would be willing to negotiate on joint American-Pakistani operation and maintenance of the planes until Pakistani personnel were fully trained, Mr. Junejo said. He added that the planes would be used along the border with Afghanistan, but safely away from areas subject to attack. **********''We do not anticipate any danger to the safety of the aircraft or the crew,'' he said. **********The Pakistani request was prompted by increasing concern among Pakistani officials over an increase in raids by Soviet and Afghan planes in recent months against civilians in Pakistani border towns. Hundreds have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded in the raids this year. The losses are three times greater than in the same period last year. Change in Situation Cited **********In his letter, Mr. Junejo said the raids had created a ''radically changed situation.'' He said the attacks had led to accusations that his Government was ''failing to defend its territory and the lives and property of its people in the absence of effective defensive measures.'' He said the accusations could erode public support for his Government. **********The Prime Minister also wrote that Pakistanis blamed the presence of three million Afghan refugees in Pakistan for the raids. **********When Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger visited Pakistan last October, he pledged that the United States would try to provide early warning radar planes to Pakistan ''as quickly as possible.'' But to lease military equipment, Mr. Weinberger must certify that it exceeds American military needs, which Administration officials acknowledge could pose a problem in this case. **********Pakistani officials had said they wanted to buy the planes to have complete control over their operation. But the main obstacles to that plan were the cost, the fact that the planes could not be produced and delivered for several years and the need to overcome Congressional resistence. **********In 1980, the United States leased Awacs to Saudi Arabia to aid that nation against possible air attack from Iran. The Reagan Administration was able to get Congressional approval to sell the planes to the Saudis in 1981, but only by a highly contested vote.

Officials here say the concern about Pakistan has caused India to reconsider its often-repeated pledge not to produce atomic weapons. **********India exploded a nuclear device in a western desert in 1974 and Indian scientists have said that rockets for India's space program could be adapted to carry nuclear warheads. **********Still, New Delhi has not specifically declared that it will develop nuclear weapons, and military experts say such a move is unlikely."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/22/world/bonn-decision-to-try-twa-suspect-is-seen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 202, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonn Decision to Try T.W.A.

Carey Jr., ADT's 60-year-old chairman and chief executive. Mr. Carey will continue to run ADT, which was formerly known as American District Telegraph, and will become a member of Hawley's board. The tender offer is expected to begin next week. Earnings Rebounded Last Year **********ADT earned $23.2 million on sales of $519 million last year, when it rebounded from three years of decline that had resulted in write-offs and a loss in 1985. It has completely replaced its product line over the last five years and spent $70 million developing computer-controlled security systems, according to Mr. Carey. Such systems monitor a range of devices that detect entry, hazardous conditions and other security problems and alert watchmen when an unusual event is occurring. **********Wall Street's view that Hawley would need to sweeten its bid became apparent when ADT's share price rose to more than $50 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange in the three days following Hawley's Aug. 17 offer. ADT shares rose 75 cents yesterday, to $51.375, following the announcement of the agreement. **********The takeover will make Hawley the market leader in electronic security services in the United States, ahead of Honeywell Inc. and Wells Fargo & Company. Hawley bought the Electro-Protective Corporation in 1981 and expanded its presence earlier this year with the acquisition of Crime Control Inc. No Change in Management **********Mr. Carey said that he and Michael A. Ashcroft, Hawley's 41-year-old chief executive, ''respected each other instinctively.'' Yesterday's announcement indicated that ADT's management would remain intact. In addition, Mr. Carey said, provision has been made to continue a 10-year-old profit-sharing and investment plan that had resulted in more than 11 percent of ADT's shares being held by its employees. **********However, analysts do not expect Mr. Ashcroft to leave ADT with a free hand for long unless earnings continue to rise substantially. Mr. Ashcroft has the reputation of wringing higher profits from his acquisitions by putting their management under the surveillance of lieutenants who are paid according to how well they meet tight operating and financial guidelines. **********Hawley earned $83.2 million on sales of $841.8 million last year from its portfolio of service companies in cleaning and building maintenance, hospital maintenance and food supply, and security services. Series of British Purchases **********The deal is one of a string involving British penetration of the United States service sector in recent weeks. The WPP Group acquired the JWT Group last month for $566 million. And a week ago, Manpower Inc. accepted a $1.33 billion takeover bid from Blue Arrow P.L.C. **********Hawley is already unusually trans-Atlantic in its focus. American investors hold more than one-fourth of its shares, and operations in the United States account for two-thirds of its business. British analysts said that the bid for ADT was strategically sound, but the London stock market has reacted negatively to Hawley's plans to issue $400 million in preferred shares, with an annual dividend of roughly 6 percent, to help finance it. **********Hawley's share price quickly fell, from 170 pence to 154 pence, in trading on the London Stock Exchange following the Aug. 17 bid.

For example, Dewe Rogerson Ltd., Eurotunnel's advertising and marketing consultant, reported that more than 550,000 people in Britain seemed certain to apply for shares. Many International Subscribers **********However, it appears that fewer than 150,000 people applied for the $:353 million ($635.4 million) worth of Eurotunnel shares offered in Britain. A similar amount is being sold in France, with the remainder sold as a private placement to institutional investors in the United States, Japan and the rest of continental Europe. The international private placement was reportedly fully subscribed. **********For British underwriters, who suffered big losses in a huge British Petroleum selloff a month ago, the Eurotunnel offering comes as another difficult new issue. Given tepid public demand for the Eurotunnel issue, it appears likely that the shares will fall a bit below the issue price of 350 pence ($6.30) when trading begins on Dec. 10. **********Eurotunnel tried to attract individual investors with free travel for long-term holders of its shares. In addition, the message to both individual and institutional investors was that the Eurotunnel, which will not open for six years, was an investment little affected by the recent stock market collapse. **********The Eurotunnel share prospectus, given its assumptions about cross-channel traffic and prices, forecast that by 1995 the original 350-pence investment could be worth $:24, or $43.20 at current exchange rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/27/world/the-un-today-nov-27-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

The general quality of the building's construction, from cherry wood floors to solid wood doors, has attracted interest. But the people who can afford $850 a square foot - the average cost in this 30-story condominium tower - are also the ones who want huge residences, not one-bedroom apartments. And 53 of the 104 units, as originally designed, are one-bedroom apartments. **********How is Mr. Zucker dealing with the problem? ''With a big hammer,'' he said. ''The head of my construction department looks at me like I'm crazy every time I come to him with a change. But people are willing to pay for it.'' **********Many requests have come from prospective buyers to knock down walls and combine apartments, and the number of units will be reduced to 90 by the time the building is ready in June, he said. **********They are also willing to pay for some of the most expensive new condominiums to rise recently on the Upper East Side, largely because of their Central Park views, lavish building materials and prime location at the southwest corner of Madison Avenue and 85th Street. About 40 percent of the building is sold. **********Conventional new condominiums in Manhattan sell for an average of $350 a square foot, but Mr. Zucker's building is expensive even in comparison with other exceptional buildings in prime locations. ''These prices are very, very, very high,'' said Yale Robbins, president of a namesake consulting and publishing concern that tracks trends in condominium sales. ''The top of the market in new construction comes in at around $700 a square foot.'' **********Three studios, measuring 620 square feet, run from $310,000 to $335,000. The 53 one-bedrooms, 845 feet to 1,100 feet, range from $400,000 to $670,000. Thirty-one two-bedrooms, 1,200 to 1,600 feet, cost between $570,000 and $1.6 million. Twelve three-bedrooms, 1,900 to 2,200 feet, are priced from $1.2 million to $1.7 million. One four-bedroom of 2,500 feet, with a 2,800-square-foot terrace, costs $1.75 million. **********On the top two floors, four custom-designed duplexes with four bedrooms and a maid's room off the kitchen are being offered for $5 million each. **********The apartments are expensive in part because Mr. Zucker paid $23 million early in 1985 for the 15,000-square-foot vacant parcel. ''I could never afford to pay that price if I didn't go with the absolute, top luxury job,'' he said. **********In addition, he purchased the air rights to three buildings to the south along Madison Avenue for $1.5 million, enabling the architect, Schuman Lichtenstein Claman & Efron of Manhattan, to create a larger, thus more cost-effective, structure. Mr. Zucker put the total cost of the building at ''well over $60 million''; the overall sellout price on the condominiums is $96,967,000. **********The salmon-colored brick building rises 11 stories along Madison Avenue and five stories on 85th Street, as required by local zoning regulations, before it steps back significantly to the tower above. At the top is a tapered glass roof, to be illuminated from within, serving as a beacon and concealing the water tower. **********''We tried to retain the feeling of the grand style of residential construction done in the early part of the 20th century, as epitomized by the residential towers along Central Park West and Fifth Avenue,'' said James Davidson of Schuman Lichtenstein. **********About 23,000 square feet of retail space on two floors will front on Madison Avenue. The ground floor will rent for $125 to $225 a square foot, and the second floor for $75 a foot. **********But there are elements in the building that seem to derive more from the 1980's style of splendor than pre-World War II apartments, such as the cherry wood floors in a herringbone pattern in the living rooms and bedrooms and the polished granite floors in the kitchens. **********The oversized picture windows were imported from the Netherlands; the glass and ash-blond kitchen cabinets came from France, and the kitchen sink from Germany. All the bathrooms have marble walls and floors and six-foot tubs with whirlpool baths. More than half of the apartments have balconies and 18 have terraces. **********A few things, however, were left out, such as a health club and a name. ''Prewar buildings never have names,'' said Louise M. Sunshine, president of the Sunshine Group Ltd. of Manhattan, the building's marketing agent. **********Monthly maintenance charges will range from $300 to $1,422. Pending expected approval by the city of an application for a tax abatement under the Section 421-a program, the real estate taxes on individual units will run from about $100 to $445 a month.

Dealers said that support from the Japanese and West German central banks, as well as profit taking following Thursday's huge declines, helped to prevent a deeper drop. **********Meanwhile, gold prices, which are closely tied to the dollar's performance, advanced again on the Commodity Exchange in New York, while silver edged down slightly.  [ Page 50. ]  Gold was quoted at $497.25 an ounce at 4 P.M. at the Republic National Bank in New York, up from $493.50 late Thursday. **********The bulk of the dollar's decline occurred during overnight trading in Tokyo, where dealers sold dollars in reaction to October's $17.6 billion trade deficit. Pushed Below 129 Yen **********The selloff, which immediately pushed the dollar below the 129-yen level it touched late Thursday in New York, was blunted by the Bank of Japan. ''Whenever the dollar sank to 128 yen, the Bank of Japan was in the market,'' said Richard E. Witten, a vice president in the foreign exchange department at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''That happened throughout the session in Tokyo. '' **********Dealers in Europe and New York were reluctant to try to break that barrier, and the yen remained in a narrow trading range for the remainder of the day. **********In late New York trading, the dollar was bid at 128.30 yen, down slightly from Thursday's close of 129 yen. **********Rumored intervention by the West German Bundesbank also seemed to deter traders from pushing the dollar significantly lower against the mark. The dollar did break through 1.63 marks during trading in Europe, but dealers backed off when the Bundesbank appeared to intervene at the 1.6260-mark level. Lower Than Thursday Close **********The move bolstered the dollar slightly, and in late New York trading the dollar was bid at 1.6305 marks, marginally lower than Thursday's close of 1.6330 marks. **********Yesterday's small declines in the dollar came on top of Thursday's huge drop and left the dollar 2.2 percent lower against the mark and 3.1 percent lower against the yen than it was a week ago. **********Traders backed off from selling even more dollars yesterday, despite a report by Market News Service that an unidentified senior official of the Reagan Adminstration had said that the Administration remained opposed to supporting the dollar. **********The Market News Service report, which flashed across dealers' screens during late-morning trading in New York, said the official had also said that the Administration was disinclined to enter any new agreement with its trading partners that would attempt to stabilize exchange rates at any given level. Comment by White House **********A White House spokesman later said that, ''if the story is not quoting the President of the United States or the Secretary of the Treasury, it is not authoritative.'' **********That comment came well after traders had shrugged off the story. In the wake of Thursday's trade deficit figure, dealers have assumed that the Administration would like to see the dollar move lower and that it is not prepared to meet its economic allies until a further decline has occurred. **********Light holiday trading could create some bizarre gyrations for the dollar between now and the year's end, traders said. But the longer-term outlook is clear, they added. **********''It is still pretty obvious that the dollar still has another 5 to 10 percent to go on the down side,'' said Dan Brooks, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank of America's New York office. ''But the market is going to tip-toe down to those levels, partly because we are in places we have never been before.'' Drop to 120 Yen Predicted **********In the coming year, Mr. Brooks said, the Bank of America expected the dollar to settle in the mid-1.50-mark range and to bring about 120 yen. ''At those levels we will probably start hearing something from the Administration that even more declines won't materially help the trade balance,'' he said. **********Economists at the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., are forecasting a dollar that will be about 7 percent lower against the mark a year from now, to around the 1.50 level. Like the Bank of America, the WEFA analysts expect the dollar to drop to about 120 yen. **********Those declines could well represent the end of a drop in the dollar that began in February 1985. **********But Craig Shular, director of currency and interest rate risk management at the Union Carbide Corporation, said the dollar was not likely to begin to rise in value immediately after it hits bottom. ''We are likely to have a rolling bottom for the dollar for a year or two,'' he added.

A General Accounting Office report published earlier said most of it could not be traced. **********Investigators also disclosed in the last several days that the G.A.O. had begun a separate inquiry into the whereabouts of millions of dollars that were apparently supposed to be funneled to the contras in Nicaragua from the sale of American weapons to Iran. **********Other open investigations, most of them previously known, focus on charges that the contras or their backers smuggled arms, trafficked in drugs, laundered money or violated the Neutrality Act, which bars Americans from involvement in military efforts against countries not at war with the United States. **********In addition to these inquiries, a special prosecutor and two Congressional committees examining the Iran-contra affair are investigating charges of illegality tied to the contras. New Aid Sought **********The investigations pose a dilemma for the Reagan Adminstration. As it pushes for additional support for the contras, the Administration is also compelled by statute to investigate reports that the rebels might have broken the law. The Administration is asking Congress for $105 million in aid for the contras for the fiscal year that begins next October. **********Investigators say President Reagan's outspoken public support for the contras has made it difficult for prosecutors and other Federal agents to carry on their work. Law enforcement officials have repeatedly denied accusations that, because of Administration pressure, their inquiries were unnecessarily slow or incomplete. **********The investigations are being conducted by a variety of agencies, including the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Customs Service and the General Accounting Office, among others. Prosecutor May Take Over **********A number of the investigations are expected to be turned over to the special prosecutor in the Iran-contra case, Lawrence E. Walsh. In announcing his appointment as independent counsel, a three-judge panel asked Mr. Walsh to investigate the sale of weapons to Iran and the reports by the White House that millions of dollars in profits from the sales had been diverted to the contras. **********He was also given authority to study charges that the contras received other possibly illegal support in their war against the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua. **********These are the Federal investigations known to involve the contras or their supporters: *********** An investigation by the United States Attorney in Miami of charges that weapons were smuggled to the contras from a Florida airport in 1985. *********** An investigation by the same office of a Miami-based cargo carrier that has been involved both in the Iran arms sales and the secret efforts to supply the contras. *********** An investigation in Georgia of the sale of four small planes, including one reportedly sold to the contras in 1985. *********** A criminal investigation of what happened to the $27 million Congress granted to the rebels in 1985. *********** A separate investigation by the General Accounting Office of the Iran arms case. *********** A Federal investigation of charges that the Americans taking arms to the rebels also smuggled drugs. *********** An F.B.I. investigation of a burglary at the offices of a group that has opposed the Administration's policies in Central America. Arms Smuggling Charged **********The United States Attorney in Miami, Leon B. Kellner, has been involved in two of the most widely publicized investigations. **********The first, begun in 1985, involves allegations that a large quantity of weapons were smuggled to the contras from an airport in Fort Lauderdale. The purported shipment could have been a violation of the Neutrality Act. **********Early last year, prosecutors were confronted with charges from a man who asserted that he had helped in the shipment. The witness, Jesus Garcia, was then in prison awaiting sentence on weapons charges. **********With information from the F.B.I. and the statements by Mr. Garcia, Mr. Kellner's office opened an investigation that continued through 1986. A grand jury took the case last fall. **********The inquiry has been subjected to criticism from, among others, Senator John D. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat whose office has studied the case. He has said that the investigation moved too slowly and that valuable witnesses and evidence were ignored. **********But Justice Department officials, including Mr. Kellner, have denied the charges. They say the inquiry has been hindered because, in some cases, witnesses have offered one account to reporters and lawmakers, but are unwilling to provide the same account to prosecutors. Pressure by Meese Denied **********The officials note, for example, that no witness have been able to offer testimony indicating that they saw anything more than a few large weapons being loaded in Fort Lauderdale. News accounts have indicated that tons of arms were sent from the Florida airport. **********Mr. Kellner denied reports indicating that he had come under pressure from Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d to delay the investigation to prevent damage to the Administration's contra-support campaign. **********The second investigation by Mr. Kellner's office involves Southern Air Transport, a Miami-based cargo carrier involved in both the Iran arms sale and the secret efforts to supply the contras. According to law-enforcement officials, the Customs Service in Miami brought the case to Mr. Kellner late last year. **********The Customs inquiry, involving potential violations of Federal arms export laws, was prompted by the crash in Nicaragua last October of a C-123 cargo plane containing weapons meant for the contras. Crewman Seized by Nicaragua **********The only surviving member of the four-man crew, Eugene Hasenfus, was released by the Nicaraguan Government last month and has been extensively questioned by the Customs Service and the F.B.I. The special House committee investigating the Iran-contra affair questioned Mr. Hasenfus today. **********In interviews, Mr. Hasenfus has said he worked for the Central Intelligence Agency. Southern Air, formerly owened by the C.I.A., has acknowledged that it held a contract to service planes used in the operation. **********According to officials, F.B.I. agents have begun a separate investigation of the C-123 crash, although their inquiry has not yet resulted in a grand-jury review in Miami. **********The Customs and F.B.I. investigations were suspended for more than three weeks last autumn at the direction of Attorney General Meese. Mr. Meese said he sought the delay at the urging of Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, then the national security adviser. **********The propriety of the delay is now under investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility and by the F.B.I., officials disclosed. **********In Macon, Ga., the Customs Service and the United States Attorney's office have led an investigation into the sale of four small-engined planes, including one that was reportedly sold to contra forces in 1985. The short takeoff and landing planes were manufactured by Maule Air Inc. of Moultrie, Ga. One was bought in 1984 by a company then headed by a retired Air Force major general, Richard V. Secord. General Denies Wrongdoing **********General Secord has emerged as a leading figure in the dispute over arms sales to Iran and the diversion of funds to the contras. He is also reported to have had extensive involvement in efforts to supply the contras. **********According to published accounts, General Secord has acknowledged that his company sold the plane for $49,000 to the contras in 1985. But in an interview today, General Secord's lawyer, Thomas C. Green, said he had no knowledge that the plane had been sold to the contras. The general, he said, ''emphatically'' denies wrongdoing. **********Justice Department officials would not discuss other details of the case, although they said that a grand jury in Macon was trying to determine if exports laws had been violated in the sale. **********Congressional aides say the F.B.I. in Washington is also conducting a criminal investigation to find out what happened to the $27 million in ''humanitarian assistance'' Congress granted to the Nicaraguan rebels in 1985.

The special White House Commission investigating the Iran-contra affair is studying this allegation, officials said. **********The Justice Department announced this month that it had requested the F.B.I. investigation into a burgarly last November at the offices of a prominent Washington political group that has opposed the Administration's policies in Central America. **********Organizations opposed to the contras are hoping that the bureau's investigation will be expanded to study 35 similar incidents that have been documented around the country over the last two years. The groups have said the break-ins might have been organized by conservative groups supporting the Nicaraguan rebels. **********For the moment, however, the Justice Department has said it will deal only with the break-in at the Washington offices of the International Center for Development Policy.

One, Clovis Desinor, a former Finance Minister, raised the specter of civil war. **********One of the most enthusiastically supported provisions of Haiti's newly adopted Constitution banned key members of the family dictatorship from running for public office for 10 years. In announcing their candidacies in mid-October, the Duvalier aides charged that the Constitution was discriminatory. They challenged the electoral council to try to enforce the ban. **********In a statement read over Port-au-Prince radio stations Monday night, the electoral council declared that 23 of the 35 men who had registered as presidential candidates were eligible. It did not name the rejected candidates but, Mr. Rocourt said, it was clear ''they were out.'' **********Among those rejected, in addition to Mr. Desinor, a 73-year-old lawyer who campaigned for the election of Francois Duvalier in 1957 and served for more than 11 years as his chief financial adviser, were Lieut. General Claude Raymond, retired, a former Chief of Staff under both Duvaliers, and several other former army officers and Cabinet ministers. **********In a statement this afternoon, Mr. Desinor indicated he would not accept the rejection of his candidacy. He charged that the electoral council's decision had been dictated by an unnamed foreign power and that the council had violated Haiti's election laws by failing, among other things, to give him a chance to defend his record. He ended his statement with his name and the words, ''Candidate to the presidency.'' **********Gunshots in the night and mysterious killings have become a part of life in Haiti since the Duvalier dictatorship collapsed in February 1986. **********The army-dominated provisional Government of Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy has refused to provide protection or administrative support to the electoral council, feeding speculation in Haiti that it wants the elections to fail. **********Alain Rocourt, the head of the Methodist Church in Haiti and treasurer of the electoral council, said that while flames swept through all three stories of the election headquarters, destroying records and equipment, he thought it would still be possible to hold the presidential elections as scheduled on Nov. 29. **********''The election will take place as planned unless we are physically unable,'' Mr. Rocourt said. **********In spite of daily death threats, Mr. Rocourt said: ''We are continuing. We are carrying on.'' **********Three weeks ago a presidential candidate was shot to death in front of the national police headquarters, across the street from the presidential palace where General Namphy has his offices, and in August the leader of a moderate political party was hacked to death in a rural churchyard. No arrests have been made. **********Soldiers firing at point-blank range killed more than 30 demonstrators in protests during the summer after General Namphy's Government briefly seized control of the electoral process. But since then the streets have been left to unidentified gunmen in civilian clothes who many Haitians assume are either former members or associates of the Tontons Macoute, the army of thugs that the Duvaliers used to terrorize Haiti. **********Mr. Rocourt said the electoral council wrote to the provisional Government on Oct. 16 and on Oct. 26 asking for protection of its offices around the country and its members and that the Government did not reply. **********''This shows the contempt the authorities have for the electoral council,'' Mr. Rocourt told a reporter for The Associated Press. **********As dawn broke today, witnesses said that a curious crowd was milling around the charred entrance to the smoldering election headquarters, but that there was no sign of security forces. **********Richard N. Holwill, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Caribbean affairs, said in an interview from Washington that the United States was encouraging the provisional Government to support the electoral council and provide ''the needed security.'' **********''We have every reason to believe at this time that they are trying to do so,'' Mr. Holwill said. He said the electoral council had not notified the Government that it was going to announce the rejection of the candidacies Monday night, ''so they were not prepared.'' **********It was not clear to him that the council had formally asked for protection, he said, adding that he was not going to try to ''second-guess'' whether security forces should have been posted at the election headquarters. **********This evening a spokesman said the Government was investigating the fire at national election headquarters and had instructed the ''appropriate authorities'' to take security measures ''to guarantee the progress of the electoral process.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/30/business/tax-division-nominee.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tax Division Nominee", "print_headline": "Tax Division Nominee", "body_text": " **********President Reagan will nominate William S.

STATIONS GO FOR A FACELIFT", "body_text": " **********THE AM band has been the ugly member of the radio family since FM sprouted in the 1950's. FM sounded better; it had better programming; and its signal was clear enough to remain stable on most radios. **********AM has tried desperately to catch up, but so far it has had little success. In a 1984 survey of public opinion about AM radio, Coleman Research, then a Dallas market research firm, found that 65 percent of the public would listen to FM over AM even if the two broadcast the same programming. **********But now, with new broadcasting technologies available, new efforts are being made to put fresh powder on AM's old face. ''It is our objective to obtain technical compatibility with FM broadcasting,'' said David E. Parigoni, senior vice president of radio at the broadcasters association. **********For example, many AM stations, hoping that the Federal Communications Commission would adopt industrywide standards for stereo braodcasting, have bought equipment that makes it possible for them to send stereo signals. But no standards have been set, so the AM stations are broadcasting blind, knowing that their signals are being badly converted on some radio receivers. **********''Tens of millions of dollars have been spent on AM stereo, but AM stereo is still a pipe dream,'' said Bruce Bishop Sheen, a media analyst for Paul Kagan. ''Anyone is foolish who says that the future of AM radio is in stereo.'' The industry has had better luck setting voluntary standards that encompass all forms of AM broadcasting. In January of this year, the National Radio Systems Committee - a joint committee of the National Association of Broadcasters and the Electronic Industries Association - released a set of frequency standards that both AM stations and manufacturers of radios are expected to adopt. **********Following the standards, the broadcasters association says, would involve little more than a few inexpensive modifications to the audioprocessor that modulates the sound to a proper frequency. The result would be that each station would focus more tightly on a single broadcast frequency, thus decreasing the amount it interferes with other stations. **********Manufacturers, meanwhile, have agreed to modify their radios in order to pick up the standardized signals more clearly. ''Adopting the standards is essentially going from the shotgun approach of broadcasting to the rifle approach,'' said Mr. Rau of the broadcasters association. Even if the new standards succeed in improving the quality of AM's sound, winning back the audience will be an uphill battle. It is a battle that many independent AM station owners are not willing to fight. They are selling out, often at near-fire sale prices. **********Over all, the market is still putting a much bigger premium on FM. Prices often climb over $100 million for FM stations; analysts say that WADO, an AM station in New York that was sold last year, commanded the year's highest price: $15 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/21/business/gap-response-to-stock-loss.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 232, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gap Response To Stock Loss", "print_headline": "Gap Response To Stock Loss", "body_text": " **********Gap Inc., responding to queries about a $8.625-a-share drop in its stock on Friday, to $47.25, said during the weekend that its third-quarter earnings could range between 40 and 55 cents a share, compared with 60 cents a share last year. **********Gap, one of the nation's largest apparel chains, said it was making the statement because of ''the volatility in our stock price and the decline in the stock's value, even though it is too early to make any definitive statements on our third-quarter results.'' **********Noting that consumer apparel sales in general had slowed this quarter, the retail chain said it was likely that many retailers, including itself, would adopt an aggressive promotional policy to stimulate sales. **********Because of this, Gap said, its gross margins in the second half would decline from last year's second half. **********But, based on a revised business plan that assumed a continuation of sluggish buying, Gap said it was still expecting sales and earnings this year to be ahead of last year.

Lowry, the best known and most successful of the get-rich-quick artists who flourished from the late 1970's well into the 1980's, apparently never absorbed the lessons of financial discipline and security that he preached. **********For nearly two decades, in late-night television commercials, best-selling books and seminars in hotel meeting rooms across the country, Mr. Lowry sold the dream of wealth. He made a fortune mixing a salesman's persuasiveness with detailed theories about real estate and finance. The combination attracted hundreds of thousands of would-be millionaires willing to pay for his thoughts. **********But last month, in a stunning reversal, Mr. Lowry, hounded by creditors, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in Federal court here. With his business and personal life in disarray, Mr. Lowry asked a judge to liquidate his $1 million in assets to satisfy lenders, partners and suppliers seeking at least several million dollars. Hard Times for Promoters **********Interviews with former associates and business partners as well as court documents from numerous lawsuits involving Mr. Lowry paint a picture of a bright, gregarious entrepreneur - part self-promoter, part teacher. His woes reflect the hard times among the latest generation of those who tout what are commonly known as get-rich-quick schemes, as well as his own poor investments. **********Mr. Lowry, along with others in the field, dispensed tips primarily designed to capitalize through real estate investments on the high inflation of the late 1970's and early 1980's. **********Mr. Lowry's advice won some adherents. But it was criticized as unworkable for most of the people who packed his seminars. Then, as inflation subsided, his kind of advice, and that of others, fell from favor. **********Details of Mr. Lowry's past and career remain murky. But according to the stories he related to students and associates, it appears that his rise was as steep and impressive as his fall. Born in Canada and raised in an orphanage, Mr. Lowry came to the United States with only a few dollars. He parlayed meager investments into a fortune and considerable fame. **********In his heyday Mr. Lowry offered advice on everything from buying real estate with no money down to running a small business and re-establishing credit. If the promise of big profits never materialized for most of his students, peddling his theories proved lucrative for him and his associates. According to court documents, Lowry enterprises grossed more than $40 million between 1969 and 1985. Two years ago he claimed a net worth of at least $12 million. **********Mr. Lowry, who is 60 years old, does not have a listed phone number, and he did not respond to a letter requesting an interview. His bankruptcy lawyer, Stephen Snipper, did not return telephone calls. **********To his supporters, Mr. Lowry remains a genius whose ideas and ability to convey them helped thousands of people attain a degree of financial sophistication, if not wealth. They say the ''get rich quick'' label is unfair. **********''Al Lowry was giving people tried and true methods that worked then, and still work now, and that allow you to make money if you really want to,'' said Tony Hoffman, a former associate. **********Mr. Hoffman, who took a course from Mr. Lowry a decade ago, invested successfully in real estate and then joined Mr. Lowry as an instructor in his seminars and a top official in his company. He now runs his own financial advice concern. **********''Al Lowry has made more money for more people in this country than anyone,'' Mr. Hoffman said. Unsophisticated Investors **********Critics then and now have contended that the Lowry strategies, most notably for buying real estate with no money down, would not succeed for the unsophisticated but ever-hopeful investors to whom Mr. Lowry most often appealed. **********Even former associates who defend the soundness of his strategies say that Mr. Lowry was mainly a salesman whose talent lay in persuading people to pay up to $495 to attend his weekend seminars. Former associates, some of whom asked not to be named, also said he was a poor manager, his investment-advice enterprises often operated in chaos and his financial judgment was flawed. **********An outgoing man with a curly toupee, Mr. Lowry seemed driven by a desire to be liked by all who met him, colleagues said. They said this trait may have led him to agree to risky business deals with friends and acquaintances. Questionable Investments **********His big mistake, they said, was investing in questionable ventures such as a health club, a restaurant and a movie instead of sticking to real estate, the field he knew best. ''He made some bad business decisions that did not involve real estate,'' said John Hebestreet, a real estate specialist in Ogden, Utah, who worked for Mr. Lowry and is now suing him over a $30,000 debt. **********But Mr. Lowry also appears to have gone astray in real estate. In an interview with The Los Angeles Times in April, more than a month before his Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, he acknowledged having lost millions in real estate at Lake Tahoe. **********Mr. Lowry's harshest critics now may be his creditors, several of whom say he has been extremely elusive in the last two years as they have tried to collect debts ranging from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of dollars. **********In Reno, Gordon and Ann Rupert are suing Mr. Lowry for $5,000 they say he owes them for roofing work several years ago on an apartment building he owned there. In Los Angeles, the California First Bank, which has won a $600,000 judgment against Mr. Lowry for unpaid loans plus interest on his health club investment, suggested in court papers this spring that he might have hidden assets, perhaps by transferring property to his former wife, Darlene, during their recent divorce. Mrs. Lowry's whereabouts could not be determined. $11.68 in Checking Account Many creditors, in fact, are wondering what happened to the wealth and property of which Mr. Lowry boasted several years ago. His bankruptcy filing said he had $11.68 in his checking account. And he said that he owes the Internal Revenue Service at least $138,675.65. His $895,000 home, which is mortgaged, is listed as his only major asset. The man who liked to be called ''Mr. Real Estate'' listed only three small parcels of land. **********''In any case like this, a lot of questions are raised by the kind of information he has presented,'' said Eric A. Joe, a lawyer with Smith & Smith in Los Angeles, representing California First Bank against Mr. Lowry. **********Until the last few years, Mr. Lowry's life seemed to be a true rags-to-riches tale. As he told it, he labored in a steel mill, ice-skated professionally and worked as a butcher before leaving Canada for California. Settling in the San Francisco area, he got involved in real estate sales. On several occasions he handled offers to buy property from sellers with no money down. To his amazement, some were accepted, prompting him to try the same, with considerable success. By 1973, Mr. Lowry asserted, he had made his first million dollars on property in Oakland. Selling Advice to Beginners **********According to court documents, Mr. Lowry had hit on the idea of selling real estate advice to others in 1969. The undertaking expanded rapidly. He started advertising that he held a Ph.D. in business administration, although it could not be determined when or where he might have received it. **********''Others had offered seminars to professional real estate people,'' one associate said. ''The genius of Lowry was to offer the courses not to the professional but to the general public. No one had done that, and for a while he didn't have any competition.'' **********Each week, Lowry courses would be offered in as many as four or five cities around the country. For a week or two before the course, a newspaper advertising campaign would ballyhoo Mr. Lowry's theories. As the operation grew, he could afford to buy late-night television time, and he produced a 30-minute documentary-style commercial, ''How to Be Successful in America,'' narrated by E. G. Marshall, the actor. An Attractive Come-On **********In each city Mr. Lowry held an ''introductory'' meeting, at no charge, that he would conclude with a sales pitch for the paid seminar that weekend, which cost up to $495. Associates said Mr. Lowry's sales appeal was invariably successful, though the later seminar would typically not be taught by Mr. Lowry himself. **********Depending on the size of the city, the paid turnout could range from 50 to 400 people, Mr. Hoffman said. For their money they got two full days of detailed instruction on the ins and outs of foreclosure, financing and the like, as well as the chance to buy more Lowry instructional materials. **********His popularity peaked around 1979 and 1980. At that point high interest rates were spawning foreclosures, forcing some sellers in distress to accept no-money-down offers. Inflation was helping almost any real estate to appreciate in value. Book a Best Seller **********Mr. Lowry's book ''How You Can Become Financially Independent by Investing in Real Estate'' made the best seller lists. He followed it with ''How to Become Financially Successful by Owning Your Own Business,'' which Money magazine described in a May 1981 review as ''so comprehensive that it deserves to become a standard reference work.'' (The books were written with considerable assistance from a team of researchers, according to associates of Mr. Lowry.) But even during those good days, Mr. Lowry's operations had problems, colleagues said. Because he was on the road so much, there were administrative difficulties within his companies. Seminars would be arranged, promoted and then canceled at the last minute. Instructors and aides came and went, complaining of low pay and sometimes taking Mr. Lowry's materials with them to start competing enterprises. None among the colleagues to whom Mr. Lowry turned over administrative duties seemed to last more than a year or two. **********One former associate said that in the early 1980's Mr. Lowry lost $1 million because of two failed strategies masterminded by subordinates. In one, Mr. Lowry's company invested heavily in a plan to sell more materials to alumni of his courses, who proved largely uninterested. In another, the company tried to hire competing investment speakers and put them to work under Mr. Lowry's umbrella. The high salaries they demanded made the plan a big money loser. Seminars in Decline **********At the same time, with the investment climate changing and new competitors emerging daily, the seminar business began tailing off. By 1985, Mr. Lowry's main company, then called the Success Development Institute, had closed its doors, though Mr. Lowry continued on the lecture circuit. **********Mr. Lowry was still holding seminars this spring, though twice in the past year his creditors have used such public appearances to serve him with lawsuits. He also seems not to have lost his entrepreneurial zeal: He was recently spotted in an advertisement endorsing a weight-loss program."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/29/business/briefs-070087.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 207, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** ARCO, Los Angeles, said it had withdrawn from a consortium building a 130-mile, $225 million pipeline to carry oil from wells in Kern County to refineries in Los Angeles County. *********** C.

The American Embassy is going to install commemorative plaques. **********To generate interest, she plans to bring a group of black American college presidents here. **********Black American interest has also generated around another slave fort, Goree Island, off the coast of Senegal. In an effort endorsed by Ebony magazine and several members of the Congressional Black Caucus, a campaign began last summer to raise $4 million to buy a 19th-century American Consulate building and to make it a museum of black achievement. **********While Goree attracts ever greater numbers of tourists each year, Bunce Island has been steadily falling into abandon since 1807, the year Britain started suppressing the slave trade. Declared a Monument **********In 1947, the island was declared a historic monument here, but little effort was made to preserve the ruins. In 1974, a hurricane reduced the last intact building to a pile of bricks. **********Today, green monkeys, red ants and three-foot long monitor lizards are the island's principal inhabitants, said Joseph L. Opala, an American anthropologist who has mapped the ruins. **********Wielding a rusty machete, Mr. Opala recently led a group of Americans up the fort's ramparts. Rusted cannons bearing the crest of King George III still point to the open sea. **********At the limit of navigability for oceangoing ships, Bunce Island served as one tip of a triangular trade route. Slaves skilled in the cultivation of rice went from here to the American colonies. Carolina rice went to London. Ships filled with ballast and manufactured goods for African trade came here. **********Despite twin watchtowers, walls topped with broken wine bottles and a battery of 100-pound siege guns, the fort was repeatedly sacked in the 18th century. One who sacked it was Batholomew Roberts, a notorious Welsh pirate from the Caribbean known as Black Bart. **********Behind the ramparts stand the decaying brick walls of the manor house. The Americans who provided the skilled labor came to Sierra Leone after fighting on the British side of the American war for independence in return for their freedom. **********Built in 1795 in what Mr. Opala called ''tropical Georgian,'' the house had louvered shutters, a verandah and a fake ceremonial fireplace. Anxious to flaunt their new-found wealth, British slave traders landscaped parts of the island with a formal, terraced English garden and a two-hole golf course. **********Mr. Opala recounted that an abolitionist once rose from the dinner table, laid with china and crystal goblets, and saw from the window ''200 naked people chained in circles and eating from troughs of rice on the ground.'' **********At the end of Mr. Opala's tour, one black American visitor, David Graff, commented that Bunce Island reminded him of a visit to Dachau. **********''Not everything you visit should be fun and touristy,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/03/business/company-news-wood-gundy-cuts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wood Gundy Cuts", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Wood Gundy Cuts", "body_text": " **********The investment firm Wood Gundy Inc. said it was laying off 150 employees in Canada and overseas because of a slowdown in business since October's stock market collapse.

Her mother and three others at the cooperative, including a 15-year-old girl, were killed. **********''The contras came in shooting, and we had no soldiers to defend us,'' Miss Solana said from her hospital bed. ''They stole cattle and burned our houses.'' **********The raid at Quisilala, near the town of La Esperanza, 225 miles east of Managua, was the most recent in a continuing series of attacks by United States-backed rebels, known as contras, against civilian targets. A trip through the contested zone indicated that contra units operating here have not significantly changed their tactics despite strong pressure on them to do so. **********The contras' human-rights record has cost them important political support in Washington and elsewhere, and some contra leaders have vowed to take action to change patterns of abuse. Contra squad leaders recently trained in the United States were reportedly taught to avoid civilian targets and concentrate on engaging the Sandinista army. **********In this part of Nicaragua, the Sandinista Government is widely unpopular. Contra forces arriving here from bases in Honduras hope to build both a military and political base, according to diplomats. **********Yet in many towns in and around Chontales Province, residents have vivid stories to tell of atrocities they say have been committed by contra forces in recent months. **********''Naturally there are wounded soldiers too, but there is hardly ever a time when we don't have civilian victims here,'' said Dr. Javier Luna, director of the Camilo Ortega Saavedra Hospital in Juigalpa, where Miss Solana is a patient. **********In the small farming village of El Nispero, a group of more than a dozen residents waiting for transportation near the main road Sunday told how six of their neighbors were killed in a contra raid Dec. 9. **********Speaking separately, several gave nearly identical accounts of the attack. They said that a 9-month-old infant was bayoneted to death and that two elderly women were shot dead after being forced to lie on the dirt floor of their home. **********Also killed in the raid were two men cut down as they ran toward their homes and a pregnant woman who, villagers said, was shot in the stomach. **********''They took three of our people away with them, and who knows if they are alive or dead,'' a resident, Antonio Diaz, said. ''It was something terrible.'' Officials Use Caution **********Not all victims of contra attacks in this area are civilians. Area residents said, for example, that the seven people killed in an attack on the village of Colonia Rio Rama on Feb. 16 were not civilians, as reported in the official Sandinista press, but rather armed and uniformed Sandinista soldiers. **********The residents' version was confirmed by foreigners who regularly travel through the area. **********Some of the civilians who have been killed by contras in this area in the last few months were Government employees. Off the main roads, officials travel with caution. Some prefer to drive unmarked vehicles. **********''Contras maintain themselves here, and they have made this quite a hot area,'' said Marina Orozco, the Sandinista Mayor of Acoyapa. **********On Jan. 7, Miss Orozco set off from Acoyapa to the village of Santa Marta accompanied by a doctor, a dentist and two officials of the Agriculture Ministry. They had asked everyone in Santa Marta with medical or dental problems to be ready for treatment that day, and they were also planning to hear demands for land made by several groups of peasants. Caravan Is Ambushed **********After arriving in Santa Marta, the officials, as planned, sent the drivers of their three jeeps back to Acoyapa to pick up a cargo of barbed wire. The caravan was ambushed, and all three drivers, one of them a Sandinista soldier, were killed. **********A soldier based in Acoyapa, Jose Luis Gomez, confirmed the account, as did an aide to the mayor and two civilians who live in the town. **********In the grazing country south of Acoyapa, in the heart of Nicaragua's beef belt, contras have managed to disrupt life on some government cooperatives. Their leaders have argued that since the cooperatives produce food for the government supply system and are normally guarded with Sandinista weapons, attacking them is a legitimate tactic. Two Cooperatives Raided **********One area southwest of Acoyapa is now inhabited only by scattered families who farm small private plots and live off the land. Members of three such families told of two attacks on cooperatives. **********On Nov. 27, they and other area residents said, raiders struck the San Pancho cooperative 15 miles west of Acoyapa. According to four residents interviewed separately, the attackers burned several houses and kidnapped at least seven residents. The rest fled, and the ranch is now abandoned. **********The raid on San Pancho did not scare away the 10 Hurtado Lopez brothers who ran El Chaguite, a well-known cooperative two miles away. In interviews where they are now living in refuge, two of the brothers said they were not suspicious when a census taker visited on Jan. 11 and learned that only four people were at the ranch. Two Women Kidnapped **********But the next morning, they said, a band of contras attacked El Chaguite. According to their account, two brothers picked up rifles and tried to resist, but both were shot, one fatally. Two women, relatives of the men, were kidnapped, but both managed to escape 24 hours later when their captors were distracted by a passing Sandinista patrol. **********''We were walking the whole time, and they made us carry their equipment,'' said one of the women, Maria Elena Suazo, 17 years old. **********The Hurtado family has now abandoned El Chaguite and is gathered in Juigalpa, the capital of Chontales Province. **********''If things calm down and the situation is controlled, we'd like to go back,'' said the wounded brother, Noel Gomez Hurtado, 21 years old, who was lying in bed with his right leg in a cast from hip to toe.

The ''Year of Hidalgo,'' with all its attendant dangers and potential for economic disaster, has come around again. **********The Year of Hidalgo refers to a conjunction of economics and politics that occurs every six years - a period of about 18 months when the Mexican president nears the end of his term and the maneuvering to succeed him reaches a peak. (It is named for Miguel Hidalgo, a hero of Mexican independence, because his image appears on bills and coins.) The Year of Hidalgo is traditionally a time when both Government spending and corruption rise in anticipation of the presidential elections and a change of administration. Public Works and 'Tortilla Bonds' **********In practice, that means rushing highways, hospitals, rural electrification, schools and other costly public works projects to completion so that candidates of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party can reap credit and political benefit from them. Equally widespread is the wooing of voters with generous subsidies for basic foodstuffs, a practice known as ''tortilla bonds.'' **********But such largesse is an alarming prospect with inflation at a record 130 percent and accelerating, with foreign debt exceeding $100 billion and with the public-sector deficit amounting to nearly 17 percent of the gross domestic product. ''The last thing this country needs right now is for the Government to prime the pumps,'' said one private-sector economist who fears that populist electoral gestures and free spending could exacerbate the country's worst economic crisis in 50 years. **********In addition, there is the specter of the two previous administrations, both of which stumbled badly on economic policy during their last year in office. **********Shortly before his departure in 1976, Luis Echeverria devalued the peso for the first time in two decades, by 55 percent, and authorized the seizure of some landholdings. Jose Lopez Portillo, in his chaotic last year in office in 1982, nationalized the banking system and presided over a precipitous decline in the value of the peso and an increase in foreign debt. **********So as the succession unfolds, Mexicans are watching for signs that history will repeat itself and that President Miguel de la Madrid will bequeath his successor an economic situation even more depressed and unmanageable than the one he inherited in December 1982. Reasons for Optimism **********On the surface, some of the alarm seems unwarranted. Mexico has record foreign reserves, expected to reach nearly $17 billion by the end of the year, almost triple the figure of a year ago. The reserves were helped by a trade surplus of $4.5 billion for the first half of 1987 and receipt of the first portion of a $7.7 billion loan signed with foreign banks in March. **********Senior Government officials have vowed to ''sterilize the reserves,'' as they have put it, by holding them aside until needed and heading off aside until needed and heading off additional inflationary pressures. But many observers here fear that the Government will not be able to resist demands from party bosses to spend at least some of that money before the election. **********The ruling party, which has been in power since 1929 and has never lost a major election, is expected to name its presidential candidate before the end of October. Voters will go to the polls on the first Sunday of next July, and the new president, who is limited to a single six-year term, will be sworn in Dec. 1, 1988. Higher Oil Prices **********Additional temptation to spend lavishly exists because of the dramatic recovery in oil prices. Mexican Isthmus, a light grade produced for the export market, now sells for more than $20 a barrel, nearly 50 percent above the average price Government planners had anticipated at the start of the year and roughly double the price of a year ago. **********Mr. de la Madrid has sought to calm fears about economic policy by promising not to veer from the unpopular austerity program that has been the hallmark of his administration. In a steady drumbeat of public declarations, senior officials have assured the public that the mistakes of the past will not be repeated. **********''The Government of the republic intends for this transition to be orderly, transparent and in accordance with the law,'' Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, the Comptroller General, said recently. ''Those phenomena popularly known as the Year of Hidalgo will not present themselves in the public administration.'' Concern About Money Supply **********Nevertheless, there are disturbing signs that things may not be proceeding as planned. According to the most recent figures, the money supply grew by a record 147 percent in the 12 months ending June 30. **********''It makes me uncomfortable,'' said a diplomat here who specializes in economic affairs, reflecting a sentiment shared throughout the business and banking community. Treasury notes and other Government paper accounted for much of that rise, leading some financial analysts to believe that the struggle for monetary and fiscal restraint has already been lost. **********In addition, large wage increases have been granted in recent months to Government bureaucrats whose loyalty and campaign efforts are essential to the ruling party. Members of some influential unions have also received wage increases well above the inflation rate. **********Some nervousness has also been generated by indications that the Government is tinkering with its exchange rate policy. The devaluation of the peso, while continuing, has slowed to the point that it is about to fall behind the inflation rate, and there are reports of a serious policy debate on the subject within the de la Madrid administration, with possible candidates for president on opposite sides of the fence. **********That is of concern to business groups because exports of products other than oil have been the most dynamic sector of the economy during the last 18 months. Such exports were up 41 percent in 1986 and an additional 30 percent in the first half of this year, in large part because the value of the peso has been kept low in relation to the dollar. Capital Leaving Again **********In addition, capital once again appears to be flowing out of the country. During the last nine months, several billion dollars that had been sent abroad has been brought home. **********But that was before the arrival of the Year of Hidalgo. In recent weeks, the rise of interest rates in the United States has begun to attract Mexican investors again, according to private-sector economists here. **********''People are concerned, and with some justification,'' one diplomat said, speaking of the way recent economic indicators are being read. ''They remember only too well that the last two administrations came apart completely and sank into incredible corruption during their last year.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/08/business/high-court-gets-pleas-on-winans.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "High Court Gets Pleas On Winans", "print_headline": "High Court Gets Pleas On Winans", "body_text": " **********The Supreme Court was urged today to uphold a disputed legal theory that has been one of the Government's most effective weapons in its crackdown against insider trading on Wall Street. **********The Court is reviewing the conviction of R.

Brant, another stockbroker, about the contents of Mr. Winans's forthcoming ''Heard on the Street'' columns. **********A company's stock price is often affected when the company is mentioned in the column. The Government contended that Mr. Winans and his associates had made about $700,000 in profits from trading on advance knowledge of the columns' contents. **********Mr. Buchwald admitted that the practice was unethical and violated policy at the newspaper, but he contended that it should not be considered securities fraud. **********But Mr. Fried said Mr. Winans and his co-defendants defrauded the newspaper by stealing its information. **********''The information was misappropriated at the time either when Winans himself traded on it or when he communicated it to others who traded on it,'' he added. **********Mr. Winans has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for securities fraud and mail and wire fraud. Mr. Felis was sentenced to six months in prison, and Mr. Carpenter was placed on three years' probation. Mr. Brant pleaded guilty to three counts of insider trading and has been cooperating with the authorities in the Federal investigation while he awaits sentencing.

Rehnquist, frequently interrupted Mr. Fried to contest his contention that there had been violations of mail, wire and securities fraud laws. **********''What if there had been no Wall Street Journal work rule?'' Justice Rehnquist asked. **********Even if there were no rule, Mr. Fried argued, there was a clear understanding at the paper that making personal use of such information was prohibited. **********Justice Rehnquist also suggested that the Government's application of the law may have gone beyond the intent of Congress. **********''You're putting layers on it,'' he told Mr. Fried. **********Congress is currently considering legislation proposed by the S.E.C. that would for the first time define insider trading and codify legal theories already used in prosecutions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/21/business/morgan-trade-kept-on-books.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1987-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 470, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Morgan Trade Kept On Books", "print_headline": "Morgan Trade Kept On Books", "body_text": " **********Six weeks after Morgan Stanley & Company rankled investors by canceling a large trade the day after it crossed the tape, the New York Stock Exchange said yesterday that the trade would stand in its records, even though no money changed hands and the trade is unlikely to ever take place. **********Sharon Gamsin, the exchange's spokeswoman, said that as far as the exchange was concerned the trade was never canceled.

The magazine's advertising pages in 1986 dropped to 1,666, from 1,775 the year before, for Publishers Information Bureau revenues of $101.1 million, compared with $102.6 million. **********U.S. News was not suffering alone, and many of the magazines it considers competition were also having problems, since they feed mainly at the same trough, supplied by high-technology and computer companies, liquor and cigarette producers and insurance concerns. And most of those advertisers for one reason or another were pulling back on their ad spending.  * * * **********Yesterday at the fancy new offices here of U.S. News, a discussion on strategy to increase ad pages included Fred Drasner, president and chief executive of the magazine, who for many years was lawyer to Mortimer Zuckerman, the owner; Richard C. Thompson, publisher, who ended up as ad director after 20 years with Business Week; Vanessa Reed, promotion director, who formerly worked for People, TV Guide and Seventeen, and finally the agency guy, Gary M. Susnjara, chairman of DFS Dorland/New York. **********Their tactic is to go after advertisers who are already convinced of the viability of newsweeklies in particular, but also business magazines, and just have not been using U.S. News. That calls for a highly competitive ad campaign, and that is just what the agency has come up with. **********They want to show that U.S. News is a news and information publication, in contrast to Time and Newsweek, which they classify as news and entertainment magazines more widely quoted in Hollywood than in Washington and frequently picturing personalities on their covers, a practice that U.S. News shies away from. **********U.S. News wants to implant in the consciousness of agency and advertiser that, if a budget calls for two news magazines, they should make the second one U.S. News just to be different.  * * * **********For the sake of the campaign, Time and Newsweek have been labeled ''the clones.'' And the first ad shows two bespectacled men who managed to get seats on an uncrowded graffiti-free subway, one reading Time, the other Newsweek. But each cover is carrying a painting of Andrew Wyeth's long-secret model. ''See the clones'' reads the line over their heads, while ''See the light'' is above the head of the man to their left, who is reading U.S. News with the cover illustrating the middle class's struggle to hold on. **********Another ad, illustrating how the big two are frequently mentioned in the hills of Hollywood while U.S. News is on the lips of Washingtonians, is satisfied with two words: ''Clones'' and ''Clout.'' **********An ad showing four newsweekly covers, each with a personality on the cover, has the headline ''Clone candy.'' The page next to it shows a copy of U.S. News on a coffee table with a cover concerning an article on higher education. Its headline says, ''Brain food.'' * * * **********These ads and at least four more will appear in Advertising Age, Adweek, Marketing and Media Decisions and New York magazines, as well as on posters in subway stations, above subway entrances and in commuter railroad stations. **********The ad budget for the year is $1.7 million, up from $1.3 million last year. This will cover four months of advertising, two in the spring and two in the fall. **********According to Mr. Thompson, the aggressive posture on ad sales includes the addition of five new ad salesmen in the last six months to the eight salesmen and two managers already working in the New York office.   $ ? * * * **********Interesting point: While the competition has been using personalities on their covers, U.S. News has been using them in its advertising. And 1987 marks the first time in a decade that it has not. Last year's circulation-boosting effort featured such notables as Mayor Koch; Joseph Papp; Eileen Ford, the model mogul; Howard Cosell, and Mike Ditka, coach of the Chicago Bears. **********The campaign appears to have worked. While Time's total paid circulation was up 2.5 percent, to 4.7 million and Newsweek's was up 1.4 percent, to 3.1 million, U.S. News gained 9.7 percent, to 2.3 million. **********And, U.S. News management is quick to brag, it sold 85 percent of its subscriptions at the basic rate, while both of the others sold only 21 percent at the basic rate and the rest below it.

''Of course the President can say no to this, but I don't think he will,'' said the Assemblyman, Hyun Hong Choo, who often serves as an unofficial party spokesman. **********Mr. Hyun said many assemblymen from his party had ''felt this was the only way.''

Since that election, he has spent most of his time in prison or house arrest, or in exile abroad. **********Today's announcement was potentially the most important breakthrough in the political crisis that has gripped South Korea for the last three weeks, and which has been marked by some of the most intense and sustained street violence during the seven years that Mr. Chun, a former general, has held power. **********Mr. Chun intends to step down in February 1988. **********Unrest has been building for the last two months over the critical issue of how to change the constitutional process for selecting South Korea's national leader.

Direct Elections Sought **********Now, it appears that the ruling camp has decided on even further concessions that it hopes will bring the opposition Reunification Democratic Party into negotiations that it has thus far resisted. **********For many months, the opposition has insisted upon direct elections, while the ruling party had demanded that if the Constitution is to be changed, it should be in favor of a cabinet system headed by a prime minister. **********For his part, Mr. Chun had said that he would accept any compromise devised by the two sides, but he also made clear that he was satisfied with the existing Constitution, which calls for the president to be elected indirectly by a 5,000-member electoral college. **********The opposition has charged that this system is weighted unfairly in the ruling party's favor, and it has pressed for direct elections as being more democratic and also its only hope to gain power. An Unexpected Development **********That the ruling camp is now prepared to agree to direct elections throws an unexpected development into an already complicated political picture. It has long been widely assumed that the ruling camp would never accept direct elections because Mr. Chun's widespread unpopularity would make it unlikely that its candidate could win. **********Mr. Roh had been designated by Mr. Chun as the successor under the existing Constitution. It was not clear whether Mr. Roh would remain his party's presidential candidate under a system of direct elections. **********There had been persistent rumors in recent days that Mr. Roh would withdraw his nomination, but some members of the ruling party have said that this offer would not necessarily be accepted and that Mr. Roh would represent the ruling side under any system. **********The crisis has been fed in good measure by the street protests that have wracked Seoul and dozens of other South Korean cities since June 10, when the Democratic Justice Party nominated Mr. Roh as its presidential candidate. Riots Had Subsided **********But street fighting between riot policemen and anti-Government protesters has subsided in recent days, raising hopes of a lull as South Korea enters its rainy season and the summer recess begins on university campuses. **********In recent days, Kim Young Sam has hinted that he might be willing to meet with Mr. Roh to discuss an end to the crisis if the ruling side offered what he called meaningful proposals. **********Mr. Kim, who met last week with Mr. Chun, has been refusing to meet with Mr. Roh, arguing that true power rested with the President."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/07/business/manufacturing-profits-down.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Manufacturing Profits Down", "print_headline": "Manufacturing Profits Down", "body_text": " **********The after-tax profits of manufacturing corporations averaged 3.3 cents a dollar of sales in the final three months of 1986, down a tenth of a cent from the corresponding period a year before, the Commerce Department reported today. **********It said American manufacturers had sales of $579.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down from $593.9 billion in the corresponding period in 1985.

The certificates are given by the Government to troubled institutions as capital that has to be repaid. **********Emigrant does, however, have what bankers would call an excellent ''franchise'': 27 offices in New York City, 500,000 depositors and 70,000 borrowers. **********Moreover, unlike many troubled savings and loans insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, the difficulties of F.D.I.C.-insured savings banks such as Emigrant have resulted primarily from swings in interest rates, according to Allan Bortel, the head of savings institutions research at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. **********Troubled F.S.L.I.C. institutions may have a ''black hole'' of bad loans, Mr. Bortel said, making institutions like Emigrant more attractive to a prospective buyer. He added that the Milsteins, by injecting new capital into Emigrant, had ''helped take the F.D.I.C. off the hook.'' **********Indeed, the Milsteins apparently believe that, managed well, the Emigrant network can be highly profitable. Will Become a Stock Company **********Buyers of other local savings banks have believed similarly of late. On Dec. 24, the Williamsburgh Savings Bank of Brooklyn was sold to the Republic National Bank of New York. And in recent years, the East River Savings Bank and the Bowery Savings Bank were sold. **********As in the case of the Williamsburgh bank, Emigrant will be converted from a mutual form of ownership to a stock company. The stock will then be transferred to the Milsteins, who will own 100 percent of the shares. **********Although a mutual savings bank is technically owned by its depositors, under New York law depositors do not get to vote on a sale of their institution if its net worth-to-assets ratio is less than 3 percent. In this case, the ratio is negative, so depositors will have no voice in the matter. **********The Emigrant's most senior managers, including Mr. O'Brien, will keep their jobs. The savings bank's 15 trustees will become board members of the new stock company, along with a representative of the Milsteins. **********Although it is unusual for a real estate developer to control a savings institution, this is not the first time it has happened. According to Mr. Halvorson, there are Federal and state laws intended to prevent property developers from using a savings institution to finance their own projects at favorable rates. **********For example, he said, loans to the Milsteins will have to be secured, and such loans will need the prior approval of Emigrant's independent directors. Expanding Real Estate Interests **********Although the Milsteins are probably best known for their real estate projects in New York City, they are also industrialists. **********Seymour Milstein, 66 years old, was formerly chairman and chief executive of the United Brands Company, the giant food products concern. His brother, Paul, 63, was president of United Brands. About three years ago, the Milsteins sold their interest in United Brands to Carl H. Lindner, a Cincinnati investor. **********Together with three of their sons, the Milsteins run an ever-expanding real estate business whose holdings include the Biltmore, Roosevelt and Milford Plaza hotels; three large apartment towers with 1,964 units near Lincoln Center; an apartment building at Third Avenue and 29th Street, and the Bank of America Building on the East Side. Although they do not rank with the top New York real estate developers in terms of holdings, the Milsteins are among the most active and aggressive. **********Their father, Morris Milstein, co-founded two building materials companies: the Circle Floor Company and the Mastic Tile Corporation of America. Both companies flourished in the postwar housing boom, and the brothers succeeded their father in running the businesses, which they used to build their real estate company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/29/world/rights-group-reports-continued-abuses-of-liberty-in-turkey.html": {"writer_name": "Elizabeth Neuffer", "pub_date": "1987-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 416, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rights Group Reports Continued Abuses of Liberty in Turkey", "print_headline": "Rights Group Reports Continued Abuses of Liberty in Turkey", "body_text": " **********Despite steps taken by the Turkish Government to stop human rights abuses, violations of citizens' liberties still continue, according to a 1987 report issued last week by the Helsinki Watch Committee. **********The committee, which monitors compliance with the 1975 Helsinki accords, said that although citizens are now allowed access to human rights groups and there is greater freedom of the press, torture is still ''routinely practiced'' in police detention. **********''Our expectations for continued human rights progress in Turkey have not yet been fulfilled,'' the committee concluded in the 158-page report. **********The Turkish Embassy, in a statement Friday in Washington, described the report as ''overwhelmed by a mass of misinformation, misinterpretation and omission of material facts.'' **********Turks are to decide in a parliamentary election today whether to keep the Government of Prime Minister Turgut Ozal.

Shopping for Credits **********Though Mr. Honecker surrendered nothing of his basic premise that the division is permament, and the West Germans stuck to their constitutional commitment to reunification, at the end both sides agreed that the visit had contributed to the process of stabilizing and improving relations. **********For Mr. Honecker, too, the visit was a chance to shop for valuable new credits and trade from his wealthy capitalist cousins. Dining with captains of West German industry, touring the industrial centers of Essen and Dusseldorf or calling on Franz Josef Strauss, the leader of Bavaria, Mr. Honecker lobbied openly for more deals. **********Mr. Honecker left behind a lively debate over what he had meant Thursday when, on a sentimental visit to Neunkirchen, the Saar Valley town where he was born, he briefly parted from a prepared text to address the sensitive issue of the border between the two Germanys. **********Throughout his visit, Mr. Honecker had come under sustained pressure to loosen contacts across the border, and in particular to end the policy of shooting would-be defectors on sight. For most of his trip, Mr. Honecker, who oversaw the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961 as the head of East German security, made no direct response, stressing instead East Germany's fundamental tenet that Germany will never be one again and demanding recognition as a legitimate and sovereign state. **********In Neunkirchen, however, he said that because East Germany and West Germany belonged to opposing military alliances, ''it is only too understandable that the border is obviously not as it should be.'' 'Our Border Can Fall' **********But he said he believed that if the countries lived up to the communique signed in Bonn on Tuesday, ''then the day will come when the borders will not separate us but will unite us as the border between the German Democratic Republic and the Polish People's Republic.'' **********The tabloid Bild carried the statement under the banner headline, ''Sensation! Honecker: Our border can fall.'' But other newspapers, politicians and Western diplomats reacted with considerably more caution, noting above all that since the days of the Solidarity free trade union in Poland, East Germans and Poles have required notarized invitations and visas to visit each other's country. **********Some thought Mr. Honecker may have been referring indirectly to the East German policy on its West German border of shooting would-be defectors on sight. The practice came under sustained and bitter attack throughout Mr. Honecker's visit. **********Diplomats said the policy was evidently not in force on the Polish border, probably because if someone did find a reason to sneak across it illegally, he would be promptly sent back. **********Friedhelm Ost, the Bonn Government spokesman, said cautiously that Mr. Honecker's comment suggested that East Germany ''was moving in what we regard as the right direction.'' **********Mr. Strauss, the conservative Bavarian leader and Mr. Honecker's host in Munich, said in a toast to the East German today that ''we won't draw utopian or fantastic conclusions from your words, but see them as signs of hope for a better way into a more secure future.'' A 'Different' Border **********According to some Western diplomats, Mr. Honecker was essentially trying to suggest that the border between the Germanys was ''different'' because of their different military alliances, and not because East Germans desperately wanted to cross to the West. East German propaganda holds that the wall was thrown up to prevent reactionary assaults on the new socialist state. **********An ancillary suggestion, the diplomats said, was that the border could be made freer if the West Germans agreed to the ''fraternal'' customs of the Soviet bloc. The East Germans are bitterly opposed to Bonn's policy of accepting any East German defectors automatically as West German citizens. **********Mr. Honecker spent his last day in West Germany in Bavaria, the prosperous southern region governed by Mr. Strauss. Though a staunch conservative, Mr. Strauss took the surprising lead two years ago in organizing a major line of credit for East Germany, and since then he has built up Bavaria's trade links with a series of visits to the annual Leipzig trade fairs. **********At Dachau, the site of one of Nazi Germany's most terrible death camps, Mr. Honecker laid a giant wreath of red roses before a wall inscribed with the words ''Never Again'' in several languages and chatted to several survivors of the camp. **********Mr. Honecker, who spent 10 years in a Nazi prison for his Communism and lost many of his party comrades in concentration camps, paid tribute to those who struggled against Fascism and those who were its victims with ''special inner emotion.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/15/business/company-news-texaco-asks-court-to-review-ruling.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 188, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Texaco Asks Court To Review Ruling", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Texaco Asks Court To Review Ruling", "body_text": " **********Texaco Inc. has asked the Texas Court of Appeals to reconsider an earlier ruling upholding the original verdict in its dispute with the Pennzoil Company.

Outside East Berlin, many people who sympathize with similar peace and ecological groups were called to East German police stations for questioning and ordered to stay away from the capital. **********The crackdown, occurring at a time when a milder wind from Moscow is blowing through the Communist camp, bringing greater tolerance for criticism, has shocked East Germans and provoked debate within party circles, according to informed Communist Party members. **********At the same time, it has prompted a soul-searching among leaders of Protestant churches, under whose protection a widespread protest movement has sprung up in this tightly ruled country. Churchmen sympathize with most of the aims of the young critics of the regime but fear that some are taking shelter in their churches without sharing Christian ideals, even loosely interpreted, and are endangering the relative tolerance that dissidents have secured under the aegis of religion. The newsletter published by the Zion Church Peace and Environment Circle has been critical of what its members consider the restrictive human rights policies of the regime of President Erich Honecker, the party leader. Nevertheless, dissidents and churchmen believe that this week's police action was not so much aimed at this newsletter as at a more radical one known as Grenzfall that is not affiliated with the church but may have been produced on the same production equipment. **********''We have nothing to do with Grenzfall,'' said the Rev. Gunter Krusche, whose title of general superintendent makes him the equivalent of the Evangelical Bishop of Berlin. **********In an interview in his suburban residence, Bishop Krusche was careful not to disavow the views of the more radical paper, whose title means ''borderline case.''

''We don't, but the church should stay the church. The task of the church is not the same as that of the political opposition.'' Obligation to Help Moderates **********Bishop Krusche, aware of the absence of other channels of free expression, said the church's functions included that of being a ''safety valve'' in a tightly controlled country. **********''But if we grant asylum, this also puts on obligation on those who take asylum,'' he continued. The obligation, he suggested, is to support the moderates against the hard-liners in an ideological struggle that he said is under way in East Germany as in the Soviet Union. **********Bishop Krusche depicted Mr. Honecker as a leader who is more pragmatic than ideological but is under pressure from hard-liners. **********While dissidents and the state were confronting each other on church grounds, an earlier intrusion into the Zion church was the subject of a trial that began Friday. **********Four members of a gang of young neo-Nazis who called themselves ''Skinheads'' faced an East Berlin court for having raided the church during a rock concert last month.

''With Mobutu's economic policies, people have eaten all the monkeys,'' he said without humor. **********Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's President since 1965 and a close ally of the United States, presides over a vast African nation that is politically stable but is losing the race for economic development. **********Called the Belgian Congo until independence in 1960, Zaire covers a land mass equal to the United States east of the Mississippi. With 35 million inhabitants, Zaire is sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous nation, after Nigeria. An Economy in Shambles **********But Zaire now seems to be black Africa's classic case of mismanaged independence. **********In 1960, a visitor could drive across the country, from this capital on the banks of the Congo River, 200 miles from the Atlantic, to the game parks near Lake Tanganyika, 1,000 miles to the east, in two days. Today, the same drive takes two weeks and a four-wheel drive vehicle. Of 85,000 miles of roads at independence, about 12,000 miles are now passable. **********The collapse of the road system prompted the collapse of economic life in much of Zaire's interior. A farm exporter before independence, the nation now imports 60 percent of its food needs. Real wages are calculated to have fallen to 10 percent of their pre-independence levels. Half of all children die before the age of 5. The current gross national product is at about the level of 30 years ago. The Wealth of Mobutu **********A black elite has replaced the colonial white elite. The new elite has failed to develop the nation. But it has made Kinshasa's Mercedes dealership the largest in black Africa. **********''Corruption remains the most serious problem,'' according to a classified State Department briefing paper prepared for Mr. Mobutu's weeklong visit to Washington last December. ''Mobutu is reputed to be one of the world's wealthiest men.'' The paper went on to estimate his worth at more than $5 billion. **********Zairian officials did not respond to requests for interviews for this article. But in an interview with The New York Times during his visit to Washington in December, Mr. Mobutu said he and his nation were ''victims of disinformation.'' **********Some of Mr. Mobutu's overseas real estate holdings are public knowledge. They include chateaus in Spain and Belgium, a townhouse in Paris, a villa near Monte Carlo, an estate in Switzerland, a horse ranch in Portgual and a villa in the Ivory Coast. **********After his meeting with President Reagan, where he asked for easier terms in servicing his nation's $4.5 billion debt, President Mobutu rented a Concorde to fly his daughter to her wedding in Abidjan. Disastrous 'Zairianization' **********Although Zaire has one of Africa's largest markets and a liberal investment code, and has been trying to follow International Monetary Fund policies for most of the last four years, few foreign investors have come forward in recent years. One disincentive has been a sharp drop in earnings from Zaire's principal commodity exports -copper and cobalt. But many investors seem wary after watching economic policy zig-zag during 26 years of independence. **********After civil war in the early 1960's, many foreign investors were ''Zairianized'' in the early 70's. **********''The phone rang at 7:30 in the morning, and officials said they were coming over to take over my company,'' a wheat miller recalled bitterly. During the year under Zairian management, he said, his company milled 176 tons of flour, compared to 23,000 the year before. **********In other cases, Zairians took over missionary schools and hospitals and sold all the equipment, even the doors and windows. **********By 1975, many of the properties were returned to their previous owners. But many of the owners, disillusioned, sold their interests. **********Further surprises followed. In December 1979, President Mobutu declared that a new currency was in circulation. Hundreds of thousands of people lost their life savings. In 1984, as part of an International Monetary Fund program, the currency was devalued to one-fifth of its previous value. The Keys to Mobutu's Rule **********Mr. Mobutu's major achievement seems to be that, having forged a nation from 200 different tribes, he has endured as its head for 21 years. He has achieved this through a mix of personal charisma, political acumen and police repression. **********''Mobutu is a far more complex character than just someone ripping this place off,'' a Western businessman said. ''He is a consummate politician.'' **********From his beginnings as an army sergeant and newspaper reporter named Joseph-Desire Mobutu, he rose to army Chief of Staff at independence and rapidly eliminated all rivals for the supreme leadership. He adopted the name Mobutu Sese Seko Koko Ngbendu wa za Banga, which translates: ''The all powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake.'' **********As a politician, Mr. Mobutu has a knack for co-opting enemies and shuffling his Cabinet to keep potential rivals off balance. **********The most recent example of co-optation is Nguza Karl I Bond, once a diehard opponent of Mr. Mobutu. Sentenced to death here for treason, Mr. Nguza testified in the early 1980's before a committee of the United States House of Representatives that was investigating reports that Mr. Mobutu had embezzled United States aid funds. **********Last year, Mr. Mobutu sent Mr. Nguza back to Washington - this time as Zaire's Ambassador to the United States. 'Torture Is Used Frequently' **********In 1984, in the last election here, Mr. Mobutu polled 99.16 percent of the vote. To make sure that the discontented eighty-four hundredths of 1 percent do not get out of hand, Mr. Mobutu maintains a highly effective police and intelligence system. **********According to a report issued last October by Amnesty International, ''torture is used frequently and on occasions extensively.'' **********The 1985 State Department human rights report on Zaire said: ''Suspects are often arrested and held for months without a hearing. Detainees with financial resources are known to buy their way out.'' **********Last March, the president of the Zairian League for the Defense of Human Rights was sent into internal exile. **********Zaire's state-run press rarely touches such topics and most Zairians know to steer clear of the police. **********''Because of the 'mouchards,' no one trusts each other,'' a Zairian journalist said of the police informers. **********Another Zairian said: ''Everyone keeps quiet.

Even if the report produces one of its periodic surprises, many economists now see little hope that the Administration will be able to fulfill its own assurances of 3.2 percent growth for this year. **********Slower growth could worsen the Administration's already difficult budget negotiations with Congress, stop the decline of the Federal budget deficits and dampen efforts to help developing countries cope with their debts. The officials also see growth slowing in other major countries such as Japan and West Germany. Lower Target Seen **********''We haven't formally dialed back, but I think we probably will,'' said Edward M. Gramlich, deputy director of the Congressional Budget Office, which makes economic forecasts for Congress. Early this year, the C.B.O. predicted 3 percent growth this year, a little less than the 3.2 percent forecast compiled by three Administration agencies - the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury's economics staff. **********''I'm still very comfortable with that forecast,'' said M. Kathryn Eickhoff, chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget. She said she saw the economy gaining momentum in the second half of 1987. **********But on Tuesday evening, an Administration-appointed governor of the Federal Reserve Board, Wayne D. Angell, told a gathering of conservative economists here, ''I know very well we are not going to be growing as fast as the O.M.B. projected.'' Mr. Angell said today that since early 1986 he had been expecting 2 percent growth this year, well below the average for the 12 officials who produce the forecast. ''I don't seem so out of step now,'' he said. **********Some prominent forecasters have already made sharp changes in their figures. Two weeks ago, the International Monetary Fund cut its estimates to show 2.3 percent growth for the United States and 2.7 percent for the world economy. Last October, the I.M.F. predicted 3.5 percent growth for the United States and 3.1 percent for the world. **********A consensus of private American economists whose forecasts are compiled in a newsletter called Blue Chip Economic Indicators shows 2.4 percent growth for the United States now, a reduction from 2.9 percent expected last September. Consequences of Slower Growth **********Such revisions seem minuscule, but economists and Government officials say that growth of 3 percent or more in the United States and in other major industrial countries, unlike 2 percent, provides the demand in world trade needed to pull along poorer countries and help them collect the funds they use to make payments on their debts. And in a world economy ever more interdependent, they say, the faster pace also helps the poorer countries feed growth of the industrial countries. **********''The scenario now shows positive but inadequate growth,'' a senior Administration official said. He attributed the slow growth to policy imbroglios among the major industrial countries - the American inability to assure continued reduction in the Federal budget deficits and West German and Japanese reluctance to adopt policies that stimulate their growth. **********Other officials said the sharp decline of the dollar was now jeopardizing the American contribution to faster growth - continued reduction in budget deficits. **********The deficit reached a record $220.7 billion in the fiscal year 1986. The Congressional Budget Office has been predicting a sharp decline in the figure for this year, to $175 billion. However, increases in interest rates caused by the latest declines of the dollar mean the Government must pay more interest on the national debt, so a C.B.O. official said the deficit this year could be $180 billion. **********Then, because of higher interest rates and because this year's deficit reduction includes increases in revenue from one-shot sales of Government loans and other assets, next year's deficit might be no smaller than $180 billion, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/14/world/reagan-planning-to-seek-more-aid-for-the-contras.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Roberts", "pub_date": "1987-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN PLANNING TO SEEK MORE AID FOR THE CONTRAS", "print_headline": "REAGAN PLANNING TO SEEK MORE AID FOR THE CONTRAS", "body_text": " **********The White House is planning to ask Congress next month to provide additional military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, should peace talks in Central America falter, senior Administration officials said today. **********A major purpose of additional aid would be to protect the rebels from Sept. 30, when the fiscal year ends, to Nov. 7, the deadline for a cease-fire in Nicaragua envisioned in a peace plan advanced by Costa Rica. **********But in Managua, the Vice President of Nicaragua said the Sandinista Government was ready to fulfill a key section of the peace plan - restoration of full press and political freedoms - only if the United States stopped aiding the rebels.  [ Page A8. ]  A Change in Direction One Administration official, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on the way here for two appearances by the President, noted that the Administration had always planned to seek more aid next month. ''Our current plan is still to go up in September,'' the official said. **********But the comments today mark a change in tone and direction by the Administration, which has been criticized by key conservatives for having announced its own plan for Central America last week in cooperation with Jim Wright, Democrat of Texas, the Speaker of the House. Two days later, five Central American presidents signed the Costa Rican-sponsored plan, which differs in some significant ways from the Reagan-Wright plan. **********Mr. Wright and State Department officials have both said that the Central American plan had become the focus of their attention. Other officials were also quoted as saying that military aid to the rebels was on the ''back burner'' because of uncertainty over how peace talks would progress. White House Takes Issue **********But today, the White House took direct issue with those statements. Asked if the White House now saw the plan proposed by President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica as pre-eminent, one official said, ''We have not agreed with that characterization.'' **********''We feel like the agreement we made last week is still the operative agreement,'' a White House official said. That agreement, he added, ''leaves clearly in place a deadline.'' **********In the White House view, the original Reagan-Wright plan still guides its policies. In particular, that means that the White House considers Sept. 30 to be the deadline for democratic changes in Nicaragua. **********Administration officials are particularly concerned about the period between Sept. 30 and Nov. 7. ''We've got an interregnum that we're going to have to deal with,'' a senior Administration official said. Other senior officials have said that the contras have enough money and supplies to carry them into November. Wright Declines Comment **********Speaker Wright, in an interview earlier this week, said the President had promised him he would not ask for military aid until after the Sept. 30 deadline in the Reagan-Wright plan. He and other Democrats actively involved in the Central American peace plan discussions declined comment today on the White House's remarks. **********The White House's disagreement with Mr. Wright came the day after President Reagan said in a nationally broadcast speech that the legislative and executive branches ''need to regain trust in each other,'' and that there ''is now a growing sense that we can accomplish more by cooperating.'' **********The White House is clearly annoyed at Mr. Wright's quick embrace of the Central American plan and alarmed at attacks from some Republican conservatives who accuse the Administration of selling out the contras. **********''We clearly want to send a message that the President has not walked away from the contras,'' a senior official said. Insertion in Reagan Speech **********The official noted that this growing concern within the White House was responsible for the insertion at the last moment of a sentence in the President's speech Wednesday night, declaring: ''We have always been willing to talk - we have never been willing to abandon those who are fighting for democracy and freedom.'' **********One important difference between the Reagan plan, and the one advanced by Costa Rica relates to deadlines. Mr. Reagan called for an immediate cease-fire and said that basic changes in the political structure of Nicaragua should be in place by Sept. 30, the day the current aid package of $100 million for the contras runs out. **********The Arias plan calls for a cease-fire, a free press and procedures for elections to be in place by Nov. 7. **********One Administration official referred to the contras several times as an ''insurance policy'' against delay and deceit by the Sandinistas. **********''We plan to address the funding issue in a way that will insure that support for the contras continues until we are all satisfied that there is a peace plan that will insure the peaceful reintegration and democratization of Nicaragua,'' he said. 'Game Plan' Not Yet Final **********The official said the Administration's ''game plan'' was not yet final. But he indicated that one possibility was a suggestion advanced by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, that aid be granted on a conditional basis, pending the outcome of peace talks. **********In an interview with reporters, Howard H. Baker Jr., the White House chief of staff, said the President had not yet made a final decision on requesting more aid next month. One key question, he said, will be ''whether realistic progress is being made'' in peace talks. **********The Administration has long been critical of the Sandinistas and suspicious of their motives, and those feelings emerged today in a number of Administration comments. **********A senior Presidential adviser noted that Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Nicaraguan President, was now in Cuba and asserted that he was ''getting his instructions'' on how to handle future peace talks. **********Asked why Mr. Ortega had agreed to sign the Arias plan, an Administration aide said it was because of ''economic isolation'' and mismanagement, pressure from neighboring democracies and the military threat of the contras. Interests of U.S. and Contras **********In a speech at the Buffalo Bill Wild West Arena in North Platte, Mr. Reagan, who is on his way to California for a vacation, referred briefly to the peace talks in Central America and stressed that any peace plan ''must be consistent with the interests of the United States and must be consistent with the intrests of those fighting for freedom in Nicaragua.'' **********In those comments, the President was clearly trying to distance himself from specifics of the Arias plan and leave open the possibility that he might reject an accord reached by Central American leaders. **********He spoke earlier in the day to community leaders at the Ted Long ranch. **********Discussing Mr. Reagan's Wednesday night speech, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said the President had wanted to discuss the Iran-contra affair in greater detail, but was talked out of that plan by his staff."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/11/business/finance-new-issues-preferred-offered-by-hartford-fire.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Preferred Offered By Hartford Fire", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Preferred Offered By Hartford Fire", "body_text": " **********The Hartford Fire Insurance Company is offering $135 million of preferred stock whose dividend rate will be adjusted every seven weeks according to the results of an auction. **********Underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation offered $67.5 million of stock with an initial dividend of 4.70 percent through Oct. 13 and $67.5 million at 4.75 percent through Nov. 3.

All the attacks have been attributed to Chinese-made Silkworm missiles fired from Iranian-occupied territory in the Fao Peninsula of Iraq. **********The attack today occurred at the Sea Island export terminal and caused an explosion that could be heard in Kuwait city, more than 25 miles away. **********A dense cloud of black smoke rose over Sea Island, an artificial platform of concrete and steel pipes about 10 miles off Kuwait's major oil port of Al Ahmadi. Three workers aboard the platform, which usually has a crew of 20, were reported wounded. **********There was no immediate comment by Iran on the incident. **********The Sea Island terminal, connected by a system of pipes to the complex at Al Ahmadi, is vital to Kuwait's oil exports. It is the main installation for handling supertankers, which are too big to go into the shallower waters at Al Ahmadi. Fire Is Extinguished **********Film on Kuwait television tonight appeared to show extensive damage to the platform, but there was no immediate official assessment of how badly the terminal had been hit. **********Fireboats and tugs put out the fire on the terminal by afternoon, Kuwait Oil Company officials said. But by evening workers were trying to contain leaking crude petroleum. **********Kuwait's Defense Minister, Sheik Salem al-Sabah, a member of the royal family, identified the missile as a Silkworm fired from the Fao Peninsula, which Iran has seized from Iraq. He said Kuwaiti forces stationed on Failaka Island, about 20 miles offshore, saw the missile coming overhead. **********''This type of practice does not serve security and stability in the Arabian Gulf, but increases tension and escalates the conflict,'' the Defense Minister told the Kuwaiti press agency. **********In Washington, Pentagon officials also said the missile was an Iranian-fired Silkworm. Two Tankers Hit **********Last Thursday, a missile struck the American-owned, Liberian-registered tanker Sungari near Al Ahmadi. On Friday, another hit the American-registered Sea Isle City, part of the re-registered Kuwaiti oil fleet the American Navy is protecting, also in Kuwaiti waters. **********On Monday, in response to the attack on the Sea Isle City, the United States raided two Iranian platforms in the gulf, bombarding one with 1,000 shells. Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger charged that the platforms were used as command centers for Iranian speedboats harassing gulf shipping. Since then, Iranian leaders have issued vows of vengeance. **********In Beirut today, the pro-Iranian organization Islamic Holy War said Moslems in the gulf were preparing for suicide missions and threatened to mount terrorist attacks against the United States and Europe. **********''The coming few days will reveal to the world America's paper-thin ability to confront Moslems,'' said the typewritten statement delivered to an international news agency in Beirut. ''The conditions of the Europeans will not be any better.'' **********The message was accompanied by black and white photographs of two of the hostages Islamic Holy War is holding, Terry Anderson, an Associated Press correspondent, and Jean-Paul Kauffman, a French researcher. This is the customary method of authenticating the message. 'A Turning Point' **********''This is a kind of a turning point in the conflict because Kuwait is suddenly much more involved than it was a day ago,'' said a Western diplomat here. ''It is a most disturbing development.'' **********The attack, he said, will strike fear into the Kuwaitis because it shows the Iranians are now able to strike at will at the oil sites that are the basis of the country's vast wealth. **********Kuwait, fearing the export of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic fundamentalist revolution, has backed Iraq in the gulf war, contributing billions of dollars and allowing Iraqi military supplies through its ports. **********Kuwait drew the United States and, to a much lesser extent, the Soviet Union into the plan to protect its oil fleet, largely in the hope that the superpowers would then find a way to end the war. **********''Now Kuwait itself has become the target,'' the Western diplomat said. ''It's exactly the reverse of the outcome the Kuwaitis wanted. **********Americans too, he said, ''have been presented with quite a dilemma.'' **********''If they do anything it will mean a widening of their role and a widening of the gulf war. If they do nothing, Kuwait is open to attack, and it is quite clear this will not be the last attack. This is the choice they have.'' Kuwait Lodges Protest **********The charge d'affaires of the dwindling Iranian Embassy staff here -five of its diplomats were sent home last month after at least three Silkworms were fired toward Kuwait, one landing near the Foreign Minister's beach chalet - was summoned to the Foreign Ministry today. The State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Saoud Mohammed al-Osemi, told him that the ''heinous and perilous'' attack ''unveiled Iran's resolve to drag nonbelligerent countries of the region into this tragic war.'' **********Other Arab countries expressed support for Kuwait. **********In Bahrain, the Foreign Minister, Sheik Mohammed al-Khalifa, summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires to tell him that the attack had ''caused a deterioration in the situation in the gulf and aggravated tension in the region.'' **********The Saudi Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, called his Kuwaiti conterpart today to pledge support against any Iranian ''aggression.'' King Hussein of Jordan telephoned the Kuwaiti ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt announced that his country was ready ''to assume its inter-Arab responsibilities toward brother Kuwait.'' **********What this might mean in practical terms was unclear.

Report of 'an Understanding' **********Another Labor Party member, Energy Minister Moshe Shahal, said that ''it is no secret that there is a document, an understanding'' between Israel, Jordan, Egypt and the United States that was conveyed to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir two weeks ago by the United States. **********''It speaks about principles for direct negotiations that would start with an international conference and continue immediately to bilateral talks between those involved in the conflict - Jordan, the Palestinians and us,'' Mr. Shahal, a close associate of Mr. Peres, said. ''There has never been such a good time for Israel to start negotiations.'' **********Prime Minister Shamir, of the Likud bloc, returned today from a visit to Paris, where he tried to talk the French out of attending any such international conference. Immediately, he went on the offensive against Mr. Peres, warning the public that new elections would bring turmoil. **********''I don't feel the Government is nearing its end,'' Mr. Shamir said, ''because I don't want this to happen. There is no need for Israel to accept this Soviet idea of an international conference that would leave Israel alone against the rest of the world. I think it would be irresponsible and contrary to the national interest to throw ourselves into a whirlpool of elections and return the country, heaven forbid, to a period of inflation and instability.'' Pollard Report Is Expected **********Feeding the tension between Mr. Shamir and Mr. Peres was an announcement today by the Parliament's intelligence subcommittee, led by Abba Eban, that it had completed hearings into the Israeli Government's handling of the scandal involving Jonathan Jay Pollard, an American naval intelligence analyst sentenced to life imprisonment for spying for Israel, and would shortly issue its report. **********A source on the committee said the investigation had concluded that leading political figures, particularly Mr. Peres and Defense Minister Rabin, seriously mishandled the case. More than a few members of the Israeli Parliament and political commentators have noted that Mr. Peres and Mr. Rabin might be motivated to bring the issue of an international conference to a crisis in order to divert attention from such conclusions. **********Moreover, if an election were hastily called on the issue of peace, the Labor Party leaders could argue that it would be foolish to change the party leadership at a time when they had a good chance to defeat Likud, govern alone and advance the peace process. Peres's Achievements Unclear **********Labor Party legislators say Mr. Shamir will also not emerge unscathed from the investigation. **********It is not clear just what Jordanian concessions Mr. Peres has achieved. According to Labor officials, King Hussein has agreed to a working paper drawn up by Egypt, Jordan, Israel and the United States. **********According to Israeli officials, the paper stipulates that an international conference be convened by the Secretary General of the United Nations and that it include all ''parties'' to the conflict, as well as the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain and China. **********After a ceremonial opening, the conference would break up into direct negotiations between Israel and Jordan and a Palestinian delegation, and between Israel and Syria and Lebanon, should the latter two countries attend. **********It remains to be determined, however, who would represent the Palestinians. Labor Party sources insist that King Hussein has sent signals to the effect that he is ready to open talks without the Palestine Liberation Organization at his side. He has made similar declarations in the past, but has always backed away from entering talks without the P.L.O. **********The question of whether the Soviet Union would take part also remains open. Israel insists that the Russians and the Chinese can attend only if they establish diplomatic relations with Israel.

The lead that it is taking in economic experimentation appears unaffected by the latest crackdown on political dissent in China. **********The city has drafted plans to build huge industrial parks, construct a subway system to unclog roadways, rebuild the water and sewer sytems, finish a tunnel under and put a new bridge over the Huangpo River to link the two halves of town, re-equip factories laboring with obsolete Soviet-made machinery and vigorously pursue substantial foreign investment. **********''We have to do things we have never done before,'' said Yang Xirong, a consultant to the Shanghai Investment and Trust Company, the city's investment banking arm. **********''We can revise and change the way we have done things,'' the former banker said in an interview before the student unrest in Shanghai in December. Population Has Soared **********After Mao's armies took control of China in 1949, Shanghai quickly became one of the country's major industrial centers. With the growth of industry, the city's population soared, from about 5 million in 1949 to nearly 12 million by 1982. City services -water, sewerage, electricity, transportation - failed to keep pace with the expansion, a deficiency that is harshly felt today. **********While the rest of China scrambled to embrace Deng Xiaoping's call for economic change and development more than six years ago, Shanghai stubbornly wrapped itself in the political righteousness it claimed as the birthplace of the Cultural Revolution, Mao's violent effort to politicize every facet of Chinese life. **********As a consequence, the special economic zones - regions that accord special rights to foreign investors -like Xiamen and Shenzhen and cities like Canton have outstripped Shanghai in attracting foreign investment. **********Shanghai's municipal government now intends to shed the past in an effort to reassert itself. Traffic the Worst Problem **********''Shanghai's most serious problem is its traffic problem,'' said Fang Hailong, an engineer with the Shanghai Metro Corporation, offering an understatement of the daily warfare among pedestrians, bicycles, cars and trucks on the city's narrow streets. ''To build a subway is the way of solving this problem.'' **********In August the central Government gave Shanghai approval to build the subway. If the money can be raised, the first excavations will begin in 1988 on a nine-mile north-south line. If construction stays on schedule, the first subway cars will roll four years and $800 million later. Six more lines are envisioned after that. **********The subway is just one of half a dozen major capital projects the city needs just as a foundation for economic expansion. Across the Huangpo River, an underdeveloped industrial and residential expanse of Shanghai lies virtually isolated by inadequate access to the main city. Construction workers are struggling to finish a new tunnel, and the Government wants to erect a bridge across the river, a major undertaking that has yet to be financed. **********In addition, the city's water supply is unhealthy and insufficient, and piped water is unavailable in outlying reaches of the city. The sewer system is crumbling and needs to be replaced. Electricity is in short supply, and it is often impossible to make a telephone call across town. **********Work has begun on repairing the water and sewerage system, and a new telephone system is being installed by a Belgian company. Bureaucratic Changes Sought **********But it is not only the sagging public services that hobble Shanghai. Some officials argue that without fundamental changes in the Government bureaucracy and the tempering of political watchdogs from the Communist Party, there is little hope that the city can move forward. **********The Industrial and Commercial Bank recently began selling $27 million in two-year bonds to finance the expansion of municipally owned enterprises. The city has also placed $156 million in bonds on the Tokyo financial market to help finance construction projects. **********''We need money to modernize,'' said Huang Guixian, the manager of the Industrial and Commercial Bank. ''This is just an experimental period. The economy is being reformed, and finance is also being reformed. This is a step in the financial reforms. One can't get loans from the state easily. In order to break the practice of 'eating from one big pot,' we have to reform our ways.'' **********Shanghai has also tried to shake off its image as a difficult city for foreign investors. Several major foreign projects, including a Volkswagen assembly plant and a cooperative venture between China and McDonnell Douglas to assemble passenger planes, are under way. **********But many other foreign investors have been scared off to other parts of China because of the labyrinthine approval process required for any project. This, city officials insist, is changing. 'Reputation Is Not Very Good' **********''We know it is difficult to do business in Shanghai,'' said Chen Dingping, a senior vice president at the Shanghai Investment and Trust Corporation, ''not only from foreigners but from other agencies in other provinces and from Beijing. The Mayor has said we have to take serious measures to change the situation. The reputation of Shanghai is not very good. It has to be changed.'' **********Three new agencies are opening to streamline the approval process for foreign investors. The city has also been given the authority to approve all foreign investments up to $30 million. Any above that level need approval from the central Government. **********Although city officials talk about Shanghai's becoming a future Hong Kong or Singapore, they acknowledge that the transformation they seek will not be easy. Whether the city is successful will depend on continuing tolerance for the growing independence of economic centers. **********''It will take years,'' said Mr. Chen, of the Investment and Trust Coproration. ''But Shanghai has the education level, the experience. We have thousands of experts, technicians. We have a human capability much higher than other cities.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/17/world/no-headline-587587.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1987-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2319, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********Earlier this month, on the hard and mountainous terrain at Semdinli, a Turkish Army patrol walked into an ambush by Kurdish rebels and lost 13 men in half an hour of rifle fire. **********By the time the helicopters arrived, Turkish officers say, it was near dusk, and the 25 or 30 rebels had fled across the crags and ravines. **********Earlier this spring, in Tasdelen, near the Iraqi border, the rebels killed 12 villagers, including women and children, the Government and villagers said.

Baghdad's war with Teheran has prompted both countries to support Kurdish dissidents against each other. **********Moreover, northern Iraq's lawlessness has offered a new base for the Kurdish Worker's Party led by Abdullah Ocalan, a Marxist rebel movement based in Damascus, Syria, whose support among Turkey's 8 million to 10 million Kurds seems limited and ambiguous. **********Additionally, Iran's Islamic revolution has spawned an Iraqi-backed insurgency by several Kurdish groups led by Abdolrahman Guassemlou seeking autonomy in three Iranian provinces on behalf of the nation's 5.5 million Kurds.

This further sours relations between Ankara and Teheran that are strained by what some Turks see as Iranian efforts to stir religious ferment in Turkey, a secular nation whose population is 99 percent Moslem.  THE GOALS: A CHUNK OF EACH COUNTRY **********Kurds, a Western analyst said, have historically waged separatist campaigns in the countries in which they live rather than seek a homeland carved from all the nations in which Kurds reside. **********Thus, the Barzani forces in Iraq seek autonomy only for northern areas of Iraq, including the oilfields. The Barzani group differs from the Turkish Kurds, who are seeking a separate state in Turkey, because they acknowledge both the religion and the clan leaderships traditional to their followers, and Turkey's Kurds offer a Marxist analysis of their followers' plight. **********In Turkey, rebels are seeking to carve out a chunk of the east and declare it a Soviet-aligned state. There, the insurgency has brought an acknowledgment that the so-called Kurdish problem, woven at times in blood through Turkey's modern history, will not be wished away. **********''We do not think that there is a very easy solution as long as the Iran-Iraq war continues,'' said a Government intelligence expert in Ankara. ''And we have no optimism about an easy solution in the Iran-Iraq war.'' **********Moreover, said Lieut. Col. Sahap Tuncer, a military intelligence specialist based in Diyarbakir, the unofficial capital of Turkey's Kurdish-speaking area, ''It is not possible to achieve results with only military measures.'' **********The comment seemed to reflect a view that insurgencies are generally not won or lost on the battlefield alone. In many insurgencies, too, civilians seem to suffer most.  FOR THE VILLAGERS, TROUBLE ON 2 SIDES **********Last Jan. 22, separatist sympathizers in the village of Ortabag near the Iraqi border laid a bomb in the home of a 60-year-old shepherd accused of being a Government collaborator, and eight people died. **********The presence of insurgent sympathizers in the village, where Turkish troops are garrisoned, seemed to reflect an assessment by the Government intelligence specialist in Ankara, that the insurgents have some support, but that it is not widespread. **********The specialist estimated the insurgents' strength at no more than 1,000. Some put the figure much lower, and Colonel Tuncer said there were ''no more than 300 terrorists,'' as the insurgents are officially called. **********The murder of the shepherd underscored another reality confronting those who live in the 7,000 or so villages that freckle the mountains of eastern Turkey with flat-roofed settlements and small, tended tracts. **********''We know the villagers' problem,'' a young Turkish officer said. ''If they commit a crime'' by helping the rebels with food or shelter, ''we punish them,'' he said. ''But if they refuse to help, the rebels kill their families.''  A LAND OF CARAVANS ANB OF DIRECT DIAL **********On the roads that twist and wind here, a traveler might see a nomadic Kurdish family, horses piled high with bright rugs and copper cooking pots turned black by smoky fires. And there will be women toting babies in tasseled wraps embroidered with gold thread. **********Every 10 or 15 miles, there will be a military checkpoint, encampment or garrison, seeming to some foreigners to resemble an occupation force, but portrayed by the authorities as the front-line defense of national sovereignty - one strand of a counterinsurgency that keeps an estimated 40,000 troops in the East. **********On the roads, too, a traveler might see electricity pylons, spindly sentries on harsh lands, and telephone lines offering direct dial to distant places, and work camps on a new road retracing routes to Iraq and Iran that were plied centuries ago by traders in silk. **********In some villages, television has brought ''Dallas'' to people familiar with blood feuds, but not with high-rises or gaudy wealth. That, too, is a strand in a campaign to secure the hearts and minds of neglected people. **********The region's uncertainties - adding to those of a wider, strategic area troubled by the Iran-Iraq conflict - offered ''a problem we can solve through economic and social measures,'' said the intelligence specialist in Ankara. **********Thus, said Omer Eru, the official administrator of this small town sandwiched in a ravine, the authorities distributed food and wood worth the equivalent of $450,000 among 400 villagers last year. This year, he said, the budgeted figure is a little higher. **********''If you neglect the people, they might be caught by other ideologies,'' he said. As he sat down to give an interview, his jacket flapped open, revealing a pistol stuffed into his belt, as if to symbolize, in part, the ''other ideologies'' represented by the insurgents. **********Mr. Eru is a Government appointee, sent here from the west - a viceroy who seems not to share the ways of those he administers.  WHERE IT'S AN OFFENSE TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE **********Because of a longstanding policy in the American-armed Turkish military, most of the troops garrisoned here have been sent from other parts of the country and do not speak the Kurdish language. Recently, acknowledging that this policy presents obstacles to intelligence-gathering efforts, the authorities deployed a 1,000-member special police commando unit trained not only in counterinsurgency, but also in the language. And that seemed to display anomalies. **********Since the founding of the modern Turkish state in 1923 on the rump of the Ottoman Empire, Kurdish has not been recognized as a distinct language. Some officials in Ankara try to portray it as a dialect of Turkish, although it is related to Farsi. **********It is an offense to speak the language, and recently, Turkey's leading singer, Ibrahim Tatlises, was arraigned and then discharged for speaking it during a concert. Stubbornly, however, the people of these lands have defied 64 years of linguistic repression; and their sense of separateness has, officials now acknowledge, been reinforced by Ankara's neglect. **********Recently, Turkish officials have broken the taboos of decades to speak more openly of the problems of the East, a poor area where joblessness is high. ''It is an illusion to think we are going to get rid of this problem overnight,'' said Gen. Necdet Urug, Turkey's Chief of Staff, in an interview with an Istanbul magazine. **********Privately, Turkish officers are prepared to acknowledge the notion of a Kurdish identity, but with the proviso that the people of this region recognize that they are Turkish citizens first and Kurds second. That, too, represents a change in official thinking, but does not imply a weakening of Turkey's traditional resolve to meet Kurdish revolt with harsher measures than are used by any of its neighbors. **********Before the latest period of military rule, from 1980 to 1983, the Marxist Kurdish Workers Party was said, in the lawlessness that gripped much of the land, to have declared ''people's free zones'' in cities like Diyarbakir. **********During the military takeover, as part of a national crackdown, 3,500 suspected Kurdish separatists were detained and 50 were sentenced to death. Thereafter, Western diplomats in Ankara say, many of the 560 suspects captured since August 1984 have been tortured to obtain information.  A CONFLICT OF FRUSTRATIONS **********But that brought only temporary respite. In August 1984, operating from camps inside Syria, the Kurdish Worker's Party revived its campaign, ambushing military patrols and, more recently, attacking villagers said to be associated with a system of self-defense supported by the military. **********The campaign, for both sides, seems mired in frustration. ''Since they use hit-and-run tactics, we expect them to come again,'' said Mr. Eru, the administrator of Uludere. The military, moreover, seems incapable of guarding against ambushes such as the attack at Semdinli April 28, which produced disproportionate casualties and illustrated the army's apparent inability to assert its superiority in arms and numbers over an elusive target. **********The campaign has wider implications, too, since it means that Turkey's four easternmost provinces are still under martial law, four years after the return to a qualified form of democratic rule elsewhere. That, in turn, embarrasses Ankara in its efforts to join the European Community. **********In addition, Turkish officials are angered at the facility with which Kurdish separatists operate in West European countries that are supposed to be Turkey's NATO allies against the Soviet Union. The Russians are seen in Ankara as long-range puppet masters in this region, exploiting Kurdish grievances to destabilize Turkey. **********Yet, the insurgents seem to be making little headway and there is scant indication that their Marxist ideology finds a widespread following among villagers, most of them Sunnis. **********''If they come to you and ask for something with guns, then you would give it to them,'' said Ekrem Alturk, a teacher in the village of Ortabag, ''but how can we approve of them when they kill our people?'' **********Last year, a Turkish intelligence source said, the separatists sought to establish a kind of ''liberated zone'' near the borders with Iran and Iraq to raise forces, butthat has not happened. **********Moreover, Syria is said to have closed some separatist camps near the border with Turkey and to have moved them to the Bekaa, Lebanon's eastern valley. Turkish air raids against northern Iraq are said to have forced the rebels to operate increasingly from Iran. The rebels' exiled leadership in Damascus is said to be riven by feuding over tactics and ideology.  A WORRY ON HORIZON: VICTORY BY IRAN **********Last month, seemingly in a shift of tactics, the rebels captured 11 villagers and spirited them across the border into either Iran or Iraq, apparently for training as insurgents, reflecting both their readiness to attack civilian targets and their ease of movement in terrain that favors them. **********Some Turkish officers say the military is seeking to take the offensive, sending out night patrols to thwart the rebels on their own turf. **********Other analysts and diplomats see a wider perspective, saying that Turkey's huge militarization of the east, close to Iraq and Iran, reflects not only the dictates of the insurgency, but also the deeper worries created by the war between its two neighbors. **********''The Turks have many things to fear from the Iran-Iraq war, but the worst scenario for them would be an Iranian victory,'' said a Western diplomat in Ankara. **********He said an Iranian victory would bring the Islamic revolution even closer to Turkey's most troubled areas and jeopardize oil supplies. Iraq sends between 900,000 and a million barrels of oil a day by pipeline to Turkey - two-thirds of its exports, and a major source of Turkey's own oil supplies. **********Were the war to spill over into the oil fields of northern Iraq, the Western diplomat said, ''it's difficult to see how the Turks could avoid getting directly involved.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/06/business/guinness-chief-reported-to-face-pressure-to-quit.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1987-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 789, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GUINNESS CHIEF REPORTED TO FACE PRESSURE TO QUIT", "print_headline": "GUINNESS CHIEF REPORTED TO FACE PRESSURE TO QUIT", "body_text": " **********The chairman of Guinness P.L.C., the big British brewer that is the target of a Government securities investigation, will face increasing pressure this week to resign, according to some of the company's large shareholders. **********Ernest Saunders, the 51-year-old head of Guinness, returned to work today from a holiday in Switzerland and will soon meet with company directors. That meeting will take place amid new allegations of questionable actions by the management of Guinness during its $3.6 billion takeover last year of the Distillers Company. **********The inquiry by Britain's Department of Trade and Industry is focusing on stock trading during the contested takeover battle for Distillers, which Guinness won over a rival bid from the Argyll Group P.L.C. Concern From Shareholders **********Mr. Saunders will meet with a special committee of outside directors, who have been hearing a rising chorus of concern from major Guinness shareholders. The directors have the power to dismiss Mr. Saunders. The company's stock price has fallen sharply since the Government investigation began a month ago, even though Guinness announced in mid-December that its pretax profits had grown to more than $350 million in the year ended last September. **********In December, the Guinness stock dropped to 288 pence, from 330 pence. Significantly, the stock rallied 12 pence, to 300 pence, or about $4.38 a share, last Friday on rumors that Mr. Saunders would soon be replaced. Today, Guinness shares fell to 294 pence. **********The concern of the Guinness institutional investors is that the widening inquiry could take several months, and that the company and its present management will remain under a cloud throughout, hurting the value of their Guinness holdings. Performance Praised **********The fund managers generally praise Mr. Saunders's performance at Guinness since 1981, when he became chief executive, and refuse to prejudge his actions in the Distillers takeover until the inquiry is concluded. However, several questioned the wisdom of allowing Mr. Saunders to remain chief executive. **********One fund manager, who asked not to be identified, observed, ''Guinness is a public company, and perceptions matter. And if its business prospects are brighter and market value are higher without Saunders than with him, he should go.'' **********Yet Mr. Saunders also has supporters. One fund manager said that despite apparent ''errors in judgment,'' Mr. Saunders ''deserves to remain as chairman unless it is actually proven he is guilty of misconduct.'' **********Some analysts stress that if Mr. Saunders were forced to resign, Guinness would miss his marketing and cost-cutting skills. ''Guinness is better off with Ernest Saunders than without him,'' said Martin Romm, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation in New York. **********Guinness has hundreds of institutional shareholders, although none owns more than about 5 percent of its stock. According to a company spokesman, the largest are Warburg Investment Management and Prudential Assurance, which supported Argyll's bid for Distillers. **********Many securities analysts had recommended Guinness shares before the investigation, but are now withholding purchase recommendations until the outcome of the inquiry. ''The main uncertainty is whether Ernest Saunders stays or goes,'' said Roderick McKelvie, an analyst for Fielding Newson-Smith & Company. **********Last week, the company's financial adviser, Morgan Grenfell Group, a leading London merchant bank, severed its ties with Guinness. The move by Morgan Grenfell came a few days after reports that Guinness had supplied funds for an $11 million purchase of its own shares around the time of the takeover bid, in a possible breach of British corporate law. **********Roger Seelig, one of Morgan Grenfell's top merger specialists, resigned from the firm last Tuesday, following allegations that he served as a go-between in Guinness's purported buying of its own stock. Guinness reportedly arranged for a nominee group to buy its shares and, afterward, the company bought its shares from the third party at above-market prices. Run-Up in Stock Price **********Purchases of Guinness shares could be significant because a sharp run-up in its stock price, before the two competing offers for Distillers closed, helped the Guinness cash-and-stock bid to prevail. Guinness has denied that it authorized the purchase of its own shares. **********The Observer, a London Sunday newspaper, reported Sunday that the finance director of Guinness, Olivier Roux, had authorized the questionable stock purchase. The paper also reported that it had evidence that Mr. Roux signed an $11 million bank check drawn on the Guinness account to pay for the transaction. Guinness has declined to comment on The Observer article."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/11/business/market-place-stock-outlook-by-technicians.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1987-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 875, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STOCK OUTLOOK BY TECHNICIANS", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE; STOCK OUTLOOK BY TECHNICIANS", "body_text": " **********MOST technical analysts believe the Dow Jones industrial average - after climbing past 2,000, 2,100 and 2,200 so far this year - is poised to scale the next century mark of 2,300. But others sniff a possible correction in the air.  After weathering a 20-point drop on Monday, the Dow caught its second wind yesterday and advanced 19.97 points, to 2,280.09, only a whisker below last Friday's record closing at 2,280.23. **********One prominent technician, Robert R. Prechter Jr. of Gainesville, Ga., has repeatedly told subscribers to his advisory letter that he expects the Dow to move above 2,300 ''before we see anything worthy of the name correction.'' Once that level is reached, he suggested, a ''swift and short'' reaction in stock prices would be likely.  * * * **********Friday evening, on his ''hot line'' telephone service for short-term traders, Mr. Prechter said that ''breadth, volume and rate-of-change statistics all suggest that a correction is approaching in the stock market.'' These technical indicators relate to the internal dynamics of the stock market. **********In an interview yesterday, however, he stressed his bullish long-term outlook for equity prices. ''For 90 percent of market participants,'' he said, ''the most intelligent thing to do is to stay fully invested.'' Mr. Prechter publishes The Elliott Wave Theorist, whose essential principle holds that stock prices move up and down in distinct waves to complete any single bull or bear market. He sees the industrial average topping out between 3,600 and 3,700 next year. In late February, when the Dow was at 2,240, Richard Eakle of Morgan Stanley & Company turned negative in his short-term opinion of the market. ''The stampede to own stocks since the beginning of the year has accelerated to a point where the market now appears ripe for a periodic shake-out,'' he said. **********He cited as particularly troublesome the widening gap between the Dow and its 200-day moving average, which represents an accumulation of prices over this period. He likened this gap to a rubber band that was stretched too far - an indication that, in his opinion, the advancing market was due for a pullback. **********Yesterday, Mr. Eakle said he believed any near-term decline would be contained in the 2,150-to-2,160 area of the Dow. For the longer term, he sees more sustained economic growth and improved corporate earnings ahead. Accordingly, his target is for the Dow to reach a high between 2,600 and 2,700 - probably in the third quarter of the year - and to finish this year ''on a weak note.'' **********Robert J. Nurock of Paoli, Pa., author of The Astute Investor, an advisory publication, believes a Dow target of 2,369 to 2,386 ''by late March or early April is viable.'' He reaches these highly specific figures by using stock charts and repetitive cycles. ''This technique is oriented more to distance than to time,'' he said, ''so that the cycles sometimes take longer to work out.'' **********Aside from the internal dynamics of the market, technical analysts peer into the future with the use of ''sentiment'' indicators related to investor psychology. Mr. Nurock, for example, employs a set of proprietary sentiment indicators, based on changes in trading patterns of stock-index options, to gauge near-term market movements. Inasmuch as these indicators continue to reflect investor skepticism about the durability of the market rally, he construes this as a positive for stock prices.  * * * **********Joseph A. Feshbach of Prudential-Bache Securities has evolved a somewhat related type of sentiment indicator. ''The unusual aspect of this market environment,'' he said, ''is that extreme optimism about the long-term secular case continues to coexist with a short-term psychology of caution.'' Thus, as long as the short-term mood of the investment community is oriented to a coming correction, he remains bullish. **********Mr. Feshbach's target is for the Dow to reach 2,400 by the end of April and 2,500 by the close of May. Once the market's short-term mentality switches to outright bullishness, he envisages trouble for stock prices. **********Laszlo Birinyi Jr. of Salomon Brothers has estimated that, because of the market's momentum and neutral sentiment readings, the Dow has the potential to rise to the 2,415 level. However, he does not place this forecast within a particular time frame, thereby adhering to the Wall Street admonition, ''If you give a number, don't give a date -and vice versa.'' **********Elsewhere, one sentiment indicator continues to flash a negative signal for stock prices - somewhere in the future. Investors Intelligence, a stock market service in New Rochelle, N.Y., tracks 135 investment newsletters to gauge adviser sentiment. ''Last week showed 53.7 percent bulls, 13.8 percent bears and 32.5 percent looking for a correction,'' Michael Burke, the editor, said.

The Conservatives have been trailing badly in opinion surveys, with their current standing rated by the leading polls at 25 percent of the electorate. But backers of free trade are gambling that the pact will revive the party's fortunes. **********The financial markets in Canada reacted today with modest enthusiasm to the agreement. Natural resource stocks advanced strongly, but banks and other financial institutions faltered. **********When Parliament began its week in Ottawa, it was evident that the agreement, reached at midnight on Saturday in Washington, is likely to become a highly contentious issue for Canada. This is consistent with the history of earlier efforts to negotiate free trade with the United States, which foundered three times in the past century. But the vehemence of the positions taken by the two opposition parties appears to leave scant room for compromise. **********After Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was greeted with a standing ovation from his supporters and described the trade agreement as a ''path for the daring,'' the two men who are vying to supplant him as Prime Minister in an election that must be held before September 1989 savaged the pact. John Turner, the Liberal leader, said Mr. Mulroney had ''put Canada up for sale,'' and Edward Broadbent, leader of the New Democratic Party, which has strong union backing, said the agreement would make Canada ''a satellite of the United States.'' Similar Reactions Elsewhere **********Beyond Parliament, the divisions were echoed everywhere. Quebec's Premier, Robert Bourassa, called the agreement ''excellent,'' as did Laurent Thibault, president of the Canadian Manufacturers Association, who said it would ''greatly enhance the prospects for manufacturing investment and jobs.'' **********But Shirley Carr, president of the Canadian Labor Congress, called the pact ''a national disgrace,'' and Bob White, president of the Canadian Automobile Workers, said the accord set Canada on course for ''a Rambo, dog-eat-dog society with no ability to maintain our social programs or to structure our own economy.'' **********The attitude of Mr. Broadbent, a Socialist whose party has consistently led both the Conservatives and Liberals in recent opinion polls, had been expected. But perhaps more significant for the prospects of the free-trade pact was the stance of Mr. Turner, a former Rhodes Scholar and Olympic athlete. **********Although the Liberals have generally maintained an open attitude on issues involving the United States, Mr. Turner took a position that might make it difficult for the Liberals to live with the agreement if they win an election. Items in Accord Assailed **********''It's 'Open Sesame,' 'Come and take us' - that's what this Government is saying,'' Mr. Turner said, referring to the accord's 10-year phasing out of all remaining tariffs, Canada's agreeing to remove restraints on energy exports, its decision to ease investment restraints and complex changes in the 20-year-old auto pact, which critics here fear will lead to job losses to the United States. As for setting up a new panel to rule on trade disputes, the opposition leader called it ''an absolute fraud'' because, he said, it did not exempt Canada from existing United States trade laws. **********Because the agreement is supposed to take effect in 1989, after ratification by Congress and Parliament, Mr. Mulroney faced difficult questions of political timing. His majority in Parliament assures the agreement of ratification, but his aides conceded privately today that few if any of the benefits he expects under the agreement, primarily in new manufacturing jobs, are likely to be visible before an election.

The corporate gift departments at Bloomingdale's, Tiffany and other retailers agree that business is thriving. **********Along with public image concerns, two factors are contributing to this year's showing. First, corporate gift budgets were set long before Oct. 19; in addition, most companies that purchase large quantities of gift items made their choices before the market collapsed. These orders come in right after Labor Day, said Ms. Hemingway of Tiffany. **********But if gift-giving continues unabated, the amount spent per gift seems to be diminishing. ''There was a modified budget over all,'' said Dorothy Desir, corporate gifts coordinator at Bloomingdale's. ''People last year may have spent $70 per gift; this year they may have gone down by $5 or $10.'' **********Mrs. Stone-Geier saw a similar trend in her store, with some clients ''instead of spending $100, maybe spending $50.'' At Neiman-Marcus in Houston, corporate clients have tended to spend less lavishly ever since ''the bottom fell out of the oil barrel,'' said Mary Ann Schlein, the store's director of public relations. **********In New York, ''I am pleased to say that clients are all doing their giving,'' said Janie Holzman Klein, president of Creative Resources Inc., a corporate gift service. ''They may be cutting down on the expense, but they're not going to stop giving.'' **********Thus, ''we've gone out of our way,'' Mrs. Klein said, to replace expensive imported items with well-designed American items that serve a similar function but are more reasonably priced. ''For instance, we had a European ice bucket that was exorbitant and we found something manufactured here that's a third of the price, but the quality is also there.'' **********So is the spirit of fun. One of Mrs. Klein's most popular items this year is a $60 teddy bear, stuffed with $250,000 in shredded currency, and called, appropriately, a ''Grin and Bear It.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/13/business/advertising-agency-s-lesson-in-survival.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 724, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Agency's Lesson in Survival", "print_headline": "Advertising; Agency's Lesson in Survival", "body_text": " **********THE J.

It is an account that the principals of an ad agency on the verge of death almost died for. This is the story: Stephen Penchina and Arthur Selkowitz founded Penchina Selkowitz in 1982, and it really flourished, thanks largely to one account: the Burroughs Corporation. They gave it great advertising. **********However, Burroughs was such a big account and so much was demanded of the agency's principals that there was little time for them to go after new business. The Burroughs billings grew from about $4.5 million a year to $12 million, accounting for 60 percent of the agency's billings. **********Then suddenly Burroughs merged with Sperry to become the Unisys Corporation, with an introductory ad budget of $40 million. A number of agencies were invited to pitch for the business, including the incumbent and Young & Rubicam, the world's largest agency. **********As it turned out, the client was unable to withstand the Y.&R. juggernaut when that agency turned on its charm, promising much creative talent and a diversity of services. **********''Y.&R. was another ball game, another league,'' Mr. Penchina sighed last week. **********Overnight, to survive, Penchina Selkowitz had to reduce its work force to 4, from 23. These included Mr. Penchina, as the chairman, and Mr. Selkowitz, as the president. They were also forced to move to 5,000 square feet and six months' free rent on a sublet at 630 Third Avenue from twice the space at 875 Third. And the principals cut their pay to a quarter of what they had been making. **********Then, with survial as the spur, they hit the new-business trail. **********That led them to France and to taking a rented car from the Paris airport to Arques, two and a half hours away. They had been up all night flying. Mr. Penchina was sick with a heavy cold, so his partner drove. **********While doing about 70 miles per hour, Mr. Selkowitz fell asleep at the wheel. He awoke as the car was leaving the road just before it flipped over at least five times.

The agency will do image and product advertising for the group. Its activities focus on the legal, accounting and financial markets. **********The other is Yegen Associates of Fairlawn, N.J., described as the oldest and largest bank-services company. It handles consumer loans. **********Both Mr. Penchina and Mr. Selkowitz came to their own agency from the big agency scene, and both say they are disenchanted with the way the biggest agency in the business beat up on them. And, by the way, some other agencies tried to unseat other clients of Penchina Selkowitz. The disaster that followed, however, helped the two learn about truly nice people in the business. **********As part of their desperate new-business effort, Mr. Selkowitz wrote letters to heads of other agencies, asking them to send prospects his way if they could not serve them because of conflicts or any other reasons.

She was a prominent performer of contemporary music in New York. **********The A.P. also said the dead included Jose Rivera Janer, president of the newspaper El Reportero. He was a close associate of Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon's in electoral campaigns and held high-ranking positions in the Governor's first administration, from 1972 to 1976. Two months ago he was named president of the struggling newspaper, which has close ties to the Popular Democratic Party. 'Good Possibility' of Arson **********Earlier today, Mr. Rivera Cruz said there was ''a good possibility that this incident will turn out to be arson,'' but he added, ''We have to finish our investigation before we can conclude that.'' **********Robert J. Creighton, the agent in charge of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, whose jurisdiction includes Puerto Rico, said in an interview today, ''We are definitely approaching this as a criminal investigation.'' **********Mr. Creighton said the investigators were focusing on labor unrest at the hotel as a likely motive. Some survivors said they had heard reports before the fire that there would be trouble in the Dupont Plaza that was related to labor problems. **********Union leaders have denied any union role in the fire and have offered a reward for information on the causes. Asked about the possibility of a political motive involving Puerto Rican independence, he said, ''We are certainly looking into that.'' Management's Role Studied **********Mr. Rivera Cruz said the possibility of criminal negligence on the part of the hotel's management was also under investigation. **********The hotel management said it had complied with proper safety standards. **********Throughout the day, teams of investigators, civil defense workers and others labored in the tropical heat amid the noxious odors in and around the ravaged building. Paramedics vaccinated teams that had had contact with the dead. **********The area around the casino and restaurant, where most of the deaths occurred, was opened to the press for the first time this morning. The scene was a mixture of the macabre and the normal. Macabre Scenes **********Two floors were gutted. At the outdoor bar, the pina colada machine was scorched, but several bottles of liquor were still standing in a neat row nearby, their labels legible. **********There were bloody towels on the adjoining beach, but a few yards away at the pool, palm trees were undamaged, plastic chairs were unmarred and paperback books, magazines and bottles of suntan lotion were strewn about the patio. A sign read: ''No Lifeguard on Duty - Swim at Your Own Risk.'' **********Bodies of some victims were found in hotel rooms today, according to workers. ''They died from smoke inhalation,'' said Rita Aparicio, an emergency medicine technician. ''The smoke went through the air conditioning system.'' Denial on Locking of Doors **********Other aspects of the case remained unclear. For example, a number of survivors said that when the fire broke out, some of the casino's exit doors were locked or barred by security personnel. Bruce Shulman, the Dupont Plaza's director, said today that ''the doors were not locked - people did exit.'' Reports to the contrary, he added, ''are being investigated.'' **********Mr. Shulman said also that three small fires that broke out in the 10 days before the disaster were reported to the police and that threatening letters sent to hotel managers in recent days had been turned over to the authorities. In response, he said, the hotel had hired 30 extra guards. **********Mr. Lopez Feliciano, the Police Superintendent, said later that he did not know whether his department had received any letters from the hotel or whether any action had been taken in regard to them. **********Mr. Shulman said he could not comment on the content of the letters, but he added that none specifically mentioned New Year's Eve. A Warning Over Radio?  In light of the controversy over warnings, Mr. Shulman was asked about a union commercial that was broadcast by Noti Uno, an AM radio station. The ad, according to Victor Negron, a Noti Uno reporter, may have been aired dozens of times in December. It told listeners that negotiations were under way between the hotel management and representatives of the teamsters union, and that the Dupont Plaza was ''not the best place to be at year-end.'' **********Mr. Shulman said he had not been aware of the ad, which only ran in Spanish. Mr. Negron commented that others who had heard it, ''didn't think of it as a warning.'' **********In answer to other questions, Mr. Shulman said the hotel has failed no safety inspections and has complied with all safety regulations. Sprinkler systems, he said, are in use only in three locations: a hallway off the kitchen, a ninth floor linen closet and a utility room off the ballroom. **********Asked about reports that oxygen may have routinely been pumped into the casino to keep gamblers from feeling sleepy, he replied: ''I don't know. Oxygen is an extremely flammable substance.'' Oxygen-pumping is a practice in some mainland casinos. **********At other gatherings, on the streets and in the cafes of San Juan today, there was continued speculation over who might be to blame for the fire. **********At noon Governor Hernandez Colon held a memorial service for victims of the blaze in the garden of his official residence, La Fortaleza. **********Afterward, he said that if the fire was ''sabotage,'' he believed it was related to labor strife and had not been an act of political terrorism. Union spokesmen later said they refused to accept that assessment at this point. **********Baltasar Corrada del Rio, the president of the New Progressive Party, which advocates statehood for this Commonwealth, said one negotiator involved in the hotel's contract talks had been arrested in 1975 on charges related to racketeering and terrorism. He suggested that investigators should explore the possibility of links. **********That negotiator, Jorge Farinacci, acknowledged today that he had been arrested in connection with the $7 million robbery of a Wells Fargo depot in 1983 in West Hartford, Conn., and that he has been released on $1 million bail. **********He also said, however, that he had not been involved in the robbery and hoped to ''have a fair trial where I will establish my innocence.'' **********He called Mr. Corrada del Rio's statement ''an unjust and irresponsible insinuation.'' ---- Soprano Presumed Dead Miss Ahrens, a soprano who was reported among the dead in the San Juan fire, was a prominent performer of contemporary music in New York, and an occasional composer. Her ''Agnus Dei,'' for two sopranos and handbells, was described as ''a confection of monastic Minimalism'' by a Times critic when she performed it at Merkin Concert Hall in 1983. **********She also performed often at the League of Composers/International Society for Contemporary Music and the Prism Chamber Orchestra. In New York she was heard in the music of Pierre Boulez, George Rochberg, Jean Barraque and numerous younger composers, as well as a special concert of music to words by Gertrude Stein in 1983. **********She also sang earlier music, sometimes appearing with original-instrument ensembles in little-known Baroque music. Her last performance here was in Mr. Barraque's ''Au dela du Hasard'' at the Guggenheim Museum, in November 1986.

Some Western diplomats say it represents a Soviet victory in a diplomatic and commercial offensive to expand into a region from which it had been excluded. **********Australia has warned that the Russians could try to use Vanuatu as a base to destabilize the region, and Adm. James A. Lyons, commander of the United States Pacific fleet, has ridiculed the description of the accord as commercial. ''They are certainly after more than fish,'' the admiral said. **********The Soviet interest in the islands apparently reflects the view of the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, that the Pacific will become increasingly important in global politics and economics. That view, which Mr. Gorbachev expressed in a speech last year in the Soviet Far East city of Vladivostok, corresponds to the growing expectation in the United States and Asia of a ''Pacific century'' in which the Atlantic basin will be eclipsed as a center of power and finance. **********By any measure, the South Pacific remains overwhelmingly in the orbit of the Western powers. But the Soviet Union may be making some progress. **********Eighteen months ago, the Soviet Union reached a fishing agreement with the island nation Kiribati, allowing Russians to fish in Kiribati's economic zone but not to go ashore. That pact expired last fall, but was soon followed by the accord with Vanuatu, which granted shore privileges. Vanuatu Got $1.5 Million **********Vanuatu has a reputation as the maverick of the region, but its motivation in signing the fishing agreement seems to have been financial more than political: This tiny, destitute nation earned $1.5 million from the deal. In exchange, eight Soviet fishing boats received the right to fish in Vanuatu's 200-mile exclusive economic zone, as long as they do so outside Vanuatu's 12-mile territorial waters. The boats may use Vanuatu ports to buy bait and supplies or to undergo repairs. **********Some foreign analysts have cautioned that this will enable the Russians to gather intelligence in Vanuatu and elsewhere in the region. ''This will be an intelligence gathering point,'' a diplomat here said. But he added, ''Of course, I'm not sure there's a lot of intelligence to gather here.'' **********Port-Vila, a sleepy capital city of 15,000 people, lacks a United States Embassy, among other things. **********Western governments worry that the Soviet fishing agreement eventually could lead to something more significant, possibly even a base. **********''They are touching land here, and the concern is that from small things great ones grow,'' the diplomat said. ''The Soviets are coming into an area in which there has never been any Russian influence, and that can't be a good thing.'' **********Sela Molisa, Vanuatu's Foreign Minister, said in an interview that the fishing agreement was purely commercial. But, when asked if Vanuatu would consider extending it to providing installations for Soviet naval vessels, if the price were right, he said that was possible. The Nuclear Arms Issue **********''If they gave us a good fee for our facilities, we would consider it,'' Mr. Molisa said. **********Officials of Pacific nations, as well as Western diplomats, say the Soviet Union has played its cards shrewdly. In particular, they say, it has burnished its image by signing an agreement to limit the scope of nuclear weapons and nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The United States, after some mixed signals, refused to sign. That upset the island nations, which manifest an anxiety about nuclear weapons that runs far deeper than concern in the West."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/27/business/personal-finance-finding-the-right-financial-planner.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1987-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1159, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Finding the Right Financial Planner", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; Finding the Right Financial Planner", "body_text": " **********WHEN the holiday spending spree is over, many people resolve to put their personal finances in order. But it is easy to be overwhelmed by the prospect, and avoid the task. Some people turn to friends and relatives for advice; others to books, magazines and newspapers. Yet another source of help is professional financial advisers, including brokers and financial planners. **********Financial planners are still less pervasive than brokers. While there is some overlap between the two professions, the concept behind the financial planner is someone who can help clients develop an overall financial strategy, not just select specific investments - although there are some who do that, too. Planners should be able to give such advice as whether to rent or purchase a home or how to determine the right amount of life, property and disability insurance, what kinds of investments are suitable and how to pay the minimum amount of income tax. They can also help in devising ways to reach specific goals: funding a child's education, for instance, or putting aside funds for retirement. **********''A financial planner is a generalist who offers advice on a broad number of areas of personal finance, and works with a team of specialists,'' said Marv Tuttle, a spokesman for the Institute of Certified Financial Planners in Denver. Thus they may work with brokers to set up investment portfolios, and with lawyers to draft wills and trust agreements to put an estate plan into effect. **********For the individual who decides a planner might be useful, there remains the task of selecting the right one. There is no good way to do it quickly. **********Consider the case of Mark A. Coffey, a New York musician. He has a lawyer and an accountant, but wanted someone ''to take an overall look at where I was going with my money, especially my taxes and my investments,'' he said. Mr. Coffey contacted the International Association for Financial Planning, a trade group in Atlanta, which sent him a list of six financial planners in New York. **********He interviewed all six by telephone and then visited two in their offices. He finally chose Claire S. Longden, who works with the brokerage firm of Butcher & Singer in Manhattan, because ''her credentials are good and she seemed to know a lot about the investment angle I was interested in.'' He said he also felt ''the chemistry was right.'' **********Experts emphasize the need to shop carefully because - unlike accountants and stockbrokers - financial planners are not subject to government regulation. A survey by the Consumer Federation of America found that fraud by financial planners cost Americans more than $500 million in 1986. At least as much money was misinvested ''because of self-interest and incompetent advice,'' said Barbara L. N. Roper, author of the study. **********The survey also found that only 10 percent of people who call themselves planners have completed a special course of study in planning, like the ''certified financial planner'' program offered by the College for Financial Planning in Denver. Some financial planners, however, have degrees in accounting, law or business. Even so, ''specific education in one subject doesn't guarantee overall competence,'' Ms. Roper said. **********Membership in the international association has doubled since 1982, to about 25,000, reflecting the growth in the industry as a whole, said Hubert L. Harris, president. ''The stock market crash this fall, a lack of confidence in the Social Security system and a general sense that the Government isn't up to the job'' are prompting people to look for ways to take charge of their finances, he said. **********Doctors, lawyers, owners of small businesses and others with specialized needs are well advised to seek planners who are knowledgeable in their areas. Problems repeat themselves, and planners with special expertise are most apt to keep current with the latest developments in their fields. Planners who have seen such changes before may also have a better sense of how to gauge the future. **********Like most professionals, financial planners are best found through recommendations from friends and business associates. While gathering names, ask why the planners are recommended. Find out whether they are easily accessible and whether they return phone calls. People can also get names from trade groups, as Mr. Coffey did. **********No matter who initially recommends the financial planner, it is a good idea to ask for references and to have a personal interview with at least two or three. Here are some questions to ask: *********** What are their credentials, in both education and experience? *********** What are their areas of special expertise? *********** What kinds of clients make up the bulk of their practice? *********** Who will do the work, the planner or an assistant? *********** What services will be provided? *********** How often do they meet with their clients? How much business do they transact over the telephone? *********** How do they keep themselves up to date on changes in the laws? **********In addition, ask to see a sample financial plan. And perhaps most important, find out how the planner expects to be paid. **********The overwhelming majority charge a fee for preparing a plan and also receive commissions from the products they sell. About 15 to 20 percent of planners receive only commissions; the remainder charge a flat fee. **********When financial planners get commissions on product sales, ''this creates a potential conflict of interest, because they promise objective advice but their objectivity may be compromised by their roles as salespeople,'' Ms. Roper said. (Stockbrokers, of course, are often in the same position.) SOME people find this argument persuasive. Ellen Aibel-Bierman, a realtor in Scarsdale, N.Y.,and her husband, Jordan, a New York lawyer, recently chose Steven Enright, of Seidman Financial Services in New York, as their adviser. High on their list was to find someone from whom ''we would get independent advice, free of any financial reward on his part,'' Ms. Aibel-Bierman said. **********Others dismiss the argument. When a financial adviser prepares a plan to sell products, and not to meet the client's needs, ''that's a question of ethics, not compensation,'' said Andrew M. Rich, president of AMR Planning Services in Plainview, L.I. **********No matter how it is figured, such advice does not come cheap. Simple financial plans for people earning $50,000 or less average $250 to $500; more sophisticated plans can cost $2,500 or more. The hourly rate for planners may range from $50 to $150 or higher, said Mr. Harris of the International association."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/19/business/l-spending-habits-608587.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spending Habits", "print_headline": "Spending Habits", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********''A Sense of Limits Grips Consumers'' (March 15) used approximately 1,500 words to describe the ''new'' conservative spending habits of consumers.

Itoh & Company. At almost the same time a consortium of 90 Japanese companies announced it was building a trade center in Hanoi. **********Japanese businesses, sometimes acting with the help of the Japanese Communist Party, have been active in Hanoi for several years. Western diplomats in Hanoi say the businesses are positioning themselves to be Vietnam's dominant non-Communist trading partner when an unofficial but effective aid and trade embargo is lifted. **********Asean leaders say Japan's trade links undercut efforts to use the promise of improved economic ties as a way of getting Vietnam to compromise on its eight-year Cambodia occupation. In a formal protest in late April, envoys of the six Asean countries - Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines - asked the Japanese Government to dissuade Nissho Iwai from giving unofficial economic assistance to Vietnam until Hanoi's forces are withdrawn from Cambodia. Japan has provided no official economic aid to Hanoi since Vietnamese troops toppled the Communist Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 and installed another Communist Government that has been more cooperative. **********Asean's protests over trade come as Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, who speaks for the Association on the Cambodia question, is about to visit both Washington and Hanoi to try to reopen stalled discussions with the Vietnamese. **********Also in May, Thailand's Foreign Minister, Siddhi Savetsila, will be going to Moscow to raise again the issue of Cambodia with his Soviet counterpart.

Freeman was working out in a park in his hometown of Rye, N.Y., when he came upon a friend. And, as it had often before, the conversation between the two men turned to Wall Street's insider trading scandal. **********''He and I have had conversations about this general subject going back years,'' said the friend, Jules Kroll, head of Kroll Associates Inc., a firm that does investigations for companies. ''And philosophically we were on the same wavelength - that there was a crying need to limit the flow of information and to send a message within organizations that it was bad business to permit any kind of leakage of information.'' **********That tete-a-tete, in retrospect, is particularly ironic, since the 44-year-old Mr. Freeman, the partner in charge of Goldman, Sachs & Company's arbitrage department, was rounded up earlier this month in the ever-widening insider trading net. **********His arrest, taking place on Feb. 12 in his Broad Street office in the middle of a working day, sent a harsh chill through the already-flustered brokerage community, not only because of its timing but also because Mr. Freeman as a person and Goldman Sachs as a firm had always been considered the cream of the business. Comments by Executives **********''They are a completely honorable, reputable, straightforward house,'' said Robert Pirie, president of Rothschild Inc., another investment banking concern. ''I've never heard anyone challenge their integrity.'' **********Mr. Freeman gets equally high marks. ''I've known him for years and I've always had the highest respect for him as an individual and a professional,'' said Mr. Pirie. Added Thomas Murphy, head of Capital Cities/ABC and Mr. Freeman's next-door neighbor for nearly 10 years: ''He's a fine family man. Everything I know about him I like.'' **********The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which for nearly a year have been unraveling the activities of an insider trading ring the likes of which most people never imagined, paint a different picture. **********In the complaint that led to his arrest, the Government charged that Mr. Freeman had leaked confidential details about the takeover defense that the Unocal Corporation was going to use in fighting a hostile bid from T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman. The information, the complaint said, was given to Martin A. Siegel, who at the time was head of the mergers and acquisitions department at Kidder, Peabody & Company. Mr. Siegel quit a similar job at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. earlier this month and pleaded guilty to criminal insider-trading charges a day after Mr. Freeman and two other Wall Street executives were arrested. Government's Accusations **********In return for the details about Unocal, the Government asserted, Kidder, Peabody gave information to Mr. Freeman about a takeover attempt against Storer Communications that proved helpful to Mr. Freeman's personal trading account. **********Mr. Freeman, who is out on $250,000 bail, has denied the allegations, and Goldman, Sachs, where he has worked for more than two decades, is said to be vigorously helping in his defense. **********Wall Street sources, moveover, say an internal investigation of Mr. Freeman's dealings, conducted last week by Goldman, Sachs and others, has unearthed no wrongdoing. **********Goldman, Sachs has hired two former high-powered Federal prosecutors to represent the firm and Mr. Freeman. Paul J. Curran of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler is working with Mr. Freeman. Mr. Curran, United States Attorney in Manhattan from 1973 to 1975, ran for Governor of New York in 1982 but was defeated in the Republican primary. **********Lawrence B. Pedowitz of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is representing Goldman, Sachs. **********The case of the Goldman, Sachs partner and his troubles holds a special fascination for Wall Street, where there is a perverse sort of pleasure in the fact that even an upright organization such as the 118-year-old Goldman, Sachs can get caught up in something of questionable legality. **********Even more important, however, is the fact that other Wall Street firms seem interested in how Goldman, Sachs handles itself in this crisis. A Path Others Might Tread **********In an era when nearly every firm on Wall Street fears that it could come under suspicion, Goldman, Sachs is seen as sort of a legal pioneer blazing a defense trail that might have to be traveled by others in the future. **********''There are people rooting for Freeman,'' said one trader, explaining that Wall Street is particularly upset about the way in which Mr. Freeman and the two other executives were treated during their arrests. If Goldman, Sachs fights, many Wall Streeters reason, it may help slow down the storm that threatens to swallow up the financial community's reputation. **********Still, Wall Street has a sinking feeling about all that has been going on. Until now, United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani has been on a hot streak, with a dozen Wall Street professionals implicated one way or another in the scandal. Many of them are buying themselves more lenient treatment by helping the Government with its case against others. **********The common belief in the investment community is that in the arrest of Mr. Freeman, as well as those of Richard B. Wigton of Kidder, Peabody and Timothy L. Tabor, formerly of Kidder, there was a message. But many are asking: for whom? A Message From the Firm **********Goldman, Sachs, too, seems to be sending a message - that it sticks up for its own. In this adversarial climate the firm, a newcomer to controversy, has closed ranks, permitting Mr. Freeman normal access to his office, as well as all the time he needs to consult with his lawyers. **********''He was doing exactly what he should have been doing,'' is reportedly the rallying cry for Mr. Freeman being heard around the halls of Goldman, Sachs these days. ''They sell and publicize what he did,'' said one Wall Street source, referring to the interdepartment cooperation that allowed Mr. Freeman to work alongside the firm's mergers and acquisition team. **********What was his job? And how did Mr. Freeman, manager of the Cardinals baseball team in the Rye Little League, find himself in the middle of an uproar? **********As head of Goldman's very small but very profitable arbitrage department, Mr. Freeman was active in betting on takeovers. Would X Company, for instance, be able to take over Y Company, and if it did how much was the stock worth? **********But there was more to the job than that. As head arbitrager, Mr. Freeman would be called upon by members of his firm's mergers and acquisition team to evaluate offers. Gauging Reaction of Others **********Mr. Freeman would, experts explained, give M.&A. the lowdown on how other arbitragers might react to certain moves being considered by a Goldman, Sachs client. **********''That is standard operating procedure,'' said one person familiar with the way Goldman handled takeovers. The same is true at most other brokerage firms, according to Wall Street experts. **********At this point Mr. Freeman, or any other arbitrager, would be prohibited from buying or selling the stock of Goldman's client or the other corporation involved. **********In the course of a day, these experts added, Mr. Freeman would normally be required to keep in touch with arbitragers at other firms. And Marty Siegel, who not only headed the mergers department at Kidder, Peabody but also was the informal head of its arbitrage department, would have been a natural source of information. **********In contested proxy battles, such as the one involving Goldman's client, Unocal, the firm's arbitrage department would have been even more active. Mr. Freeman, in his role as head of arbitrage, would have been expected to contact other ''arbs'' who held large amounts of Unocal stock and try to persuade them to surrender their votes to management. Teamwork Serving Clients **********Such cooperation, in the corporate view of Goldman, Sachs, is the type of teamwork that it feels is necessary to serve the client best. And in a firm that prides itself on the importance of all its professional employees, from the highest in rank to the lowest, that sort of ''gang tackling'' (as it has been called in the press) is lauded. **********Whether Mr. Freeman crossed over the ill-defined line between legal and illegal contact with the other arbitragers will probably be the hottest issue of the case. Goldman, Sachs, experts believe, will probably contend that even if Mr. Freeman surrendered information that he should not have, it was done innocently. **********The Government has apparently not yet released all the information it has on Mr. Freeman. In its complaint, the Government said it had received its information about the Goldman partner from Mr. Siegel, ''among other sources.'' **********Those sources have not yet been identified, but there has been some conjecture on Wall Street that Ivan F. Boesky, the apparent ringleader of the scandal, might have pointed the first finger. Mr. Boesky was penalized $100 million in November for trading on insider information and has agreed to plead guilty to an unspecified criminal charge. Secretive About Sources **********The Government has been so secretive about these other sources that even many of those intimately familiar with the case have no hint as to their identity. **********If Mr. Boesky is one of the other sources, however, that would mean that two people who have agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges have accused Mr. Freeman. And if that should be the case, Goldman, Sachs and Mr. Freeman are likely to argue that each did so to spread the blame. **********Goldman, Sachs, the conservative firm that still shuns clients wanting to attempt unfriendly takeovers, now finds itself in the unaccustomed position of taking a forceful lead in one of the biggest controversies ever to confront Wall Street. **********''Of course, people are uncomfortable that anyone could make such an accusation,'' said one source close to Goldman, Sachs. But, the source added, Goldman, Sachs is so annoyed at the way the matter was handled that ''it has rallied the firm'' to put up a strong defense."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/17/business/major-decisions-in-insider-trading-law.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 657, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Chronology", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Major Decisions in Insider Trading Law", "print_headline": "Major Decisions in Insider Trading Law", "body_text": " **********Trading of securities by company executives based on inside information has been illegal throughout much of the history of corporate America. It was not until the 1960's that Federal authorities sought to broaden the notion of ''insider'' to include printers, financial analysts and journalists. Following are some of the major developments - before yesterday's Winans decision - in insider trading law.  1909: The United States Supreme Court establishes a rule that the director of a company must either disclose the inside information or abstain from trading. Although the case, Strong v. Repide, made it clear than an executive could not use privileged information for profit, it did not address the issue of who is an insider.  1934: Congress passes the Securities Exchange Act, which contains a key provision, Section 10, broadly outlawing certain forms of stock fraud. Based on Section 10, the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1942 adopts Rule 10b-5 making the fraud provisions applicable to purchases as well as sales of securities. Section 10 and Rule 10b-5 become the key provisions to prosecute illegal insider trading. Neither provision actually defines insider trading.  1968: The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York rules that anyone who possesses inside information of a consequential nature must either disclose it to all of the investing public or abstain from trading until that information is public. Acting on a tip that the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company had discovered a site near Timmins, Ontario, rich with copper ore, company officials traded heavily in the stock before disclosing the find. **********The officials were sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by shareholders, who contended that the executives had traded on inside information. In 1968, the Court of Appeals ruled against the executives, saying that anyone who possesses inside information of a consequential nature must either disclose it to all of the investing public or abstain from trading until that information is public.  1980: The Supreme Court reverses the insider trading conviction of Vincent F. Chiarella. In 1978, the S.E.C. said Mr. Chiarella, a printer at Pandick Press, had pieced together the names of corporate targets from confidential documents and then traded on that information. A Federal court, using Section 10 and Rule 10b-5, convicted Mr. Chiarella of 17 counts of securities fraud and sentenced him to one year in prison. **********The Supreme Court said there must be a confidential relationship, or fiduciary duty, between any defendant and someone else for there to be a violation of the securities law. Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell, writing for the Court, said Mr. Chiarella had owed no duty to the sellers of the stock he had bought.  1983: The Supreme Court rules that Raymond Dirks, a financial analyst, did not commit illegal insider trading by telling clients to sell their stock in the Equity Funding Corporation. Mr. Dirks had uncovered a huge fraud at Equity Funding in 1973. Rather than make his discovery public, he told clients to get rid of their stock in the company. Justice Powell, writing for the court, set certain limits on the insider trading law and said the S.E.C. was wrong to assume that anyone who receives an inside tip and trades on it violates those laws. **********Justice Powell said the duty of a person who receives an inside tip - known in securities jargon as a ''tippee'' - depends entirely on whether the source of the tip has breached a legal duty to the corporation's shareholders in passing the information along."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/20/business/company-news-moore-mccormack-chief-to-buy-units.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOORE McCORMACK CHIEF TO BUY UNITS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; MOORE McCORMACK CHIEF TO BUY UNITS", "body_text": " **********Moore McCormack Resources Inc. has agreed to sell its Great Lakes and ocean bulk shipping subsidiaries to its chairman, James R.

But there have been challengers. The first was Alexander Hamilton, who in 1791 argued for government policies that would encourage native manufacturing while protecting it from British exports. **********Britain was the world's great trading power then - a role that eventually passed to the United States, without much attention having been paid to Hamilton's theories. But now that Japan wears the crown, some professors at the Harvard Business School are trying to supply the theoretical framework for another challenge to free trade. **********The professors' views are not brand new. But the audience seems to be growing. Last week, for example, representatives of the auto, machine tool, chemical and semiconductor industries traveled to Harvard, in shifts, for workshops that lasted six days. A principal concern was the onslaught of low-cost, high-quality Japanese goods, and the professors, in effect, justified a tougher strategy to deal with the competition. **********''We are looking for an intellectual structure that reflects the real world, and this one does,'' said Andrew A. Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, representing an industry that is losing badly to the Japanese. **********The Harvard theory comes in two layers, one involving trade strategy and the other Japan's manufacturing prowess. The latter has to be matched, the professors said. American factory costs have to come down, partly through joint research projects, such as Sematech, the semiconductor industry's embryonic effort. The technology that emerges from this research should be shared by competitors within an industry. This sort of factory technology sharing is rare in the United States. But the goal is to do away with competition at the factory level. Instead, each company in an industry would have expertise to build a state-of-the-art ''generic'' factory. Competition would be elevated to product design and to marketing. In addition, manufacturing efficiency would be enhanced through greater loyalty between customers and suppliers. Such loyalty comes easily to the Japanese, but is resisted by Americans. **********These manufacturing ideas are shared by the five principal members of the Harvard professorial group: Joseph L. Bower, Bruce R. Scott, Robert H. Hayes, Kim B. Clark and Richard Walton. The ideas also are being pushed by the Berkeley Roundtable on International Economics at the University of California. The Berkeley professors helped to run the workshops at Harvard last week. **********The trade part of their theory centers on the proposition that the law of comparative advantage, the main underpinning of free trade, is unrealistic. Here the professors disagree a bit among themselves. But the gist of their case is that, until Americans realize that free trade is a mirage, they will be reluctant to defend American industry. **********Comparative advantage holds that the natural tendency of any nation is to sell abroad the goods that it produces better than other nations. Even when two industrial powers such as the United States and Japan make many goods well, they tend to export the items that one is relatively better at producing than the other - for example, computers from America and small cars from Japan. **********Most American economists, and many business executives, still believe in the essential truth of comparative advantage and in the power of exchange rates to eventually reverse the American trade deficit. ''Show me something that has worked better than free trade and I'll sign up for it,'' said John Hackett, chief financial officer at Cummins Engine, which makes diesel engines. **********But the business school group, and particularly Mr. Scott, insists that comparative advantage is no longer a natural phenomenon. Mr. Scott argues that comparative advantage in modern society is created and manipulated. He says this is exactly what the Japanese do when they build up huge industries at home, protected by trade barriers, then ''dump'' excess production abroad at low prices. Their goal, Mr. Scott argues, is to systematically overpower industry after industry. **********But the business school professors oppose protectionist trade laws. They want a Government trade strategy that singles out priority industries for help. Semiconductors is one because electronic chips are widely used in American products. **********The Government would also push measures that gain American manufacturers ''fair access'' to Japan. Last year's semiconductor anti-dumping agreement, negotiated with the Japanese, is the type of pressure favored by the professors. **********That might not be Japan-bashing, but it certainly is economic nationalism in the Hamilton tradition - a nationalism that in an economy so central to world trade could, in the view of Robert B. Reich, another Harvard University economist, ''very easily transmogrify into protectionism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/30/business/dividend-meetings-151587.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********Following is a partial list of dividend meetings for the week of March 30, 1987:           MONDAY        Ameron Inc   Unocal        TUESDAY        Carolina Freight   Cascade Nat Gas        WEDNESDAY        Amer Water Wks   Nevada Power        Houston Indus        THURSDAY        General Dynamics   Orange & Rockland Utils        Mercantile Stores   Phillips-Van Heusen        FRIDAY        Flowers Indus   Sterling Drug"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/27/business/l-sales-force-051587.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sales Force", "print_headline": "Sales Force", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Regarding the ''Death of the Salesman'' (Prospects, Sept. 6), the practice of department store management dealing directly with resource management is hardly a new phenomenon.

However, Ms. Steinem said, ''They are very good. We are pleased with them.'' **********The money from the sale of the magazine will go to the Ms. Foundation for Education and Communications. Ms. Steinem said that neither she nor Ms. Carbine would profit from the sale. **********Sandra Yates, president of Fairfax Publications (United States) Ltd., said that the two parties hoped to close the deal early next month and that Fairfax would begin a direct mail campaign to increase circulation by more than 40 percent within five years, to 650,000, and to lift advertising. **********''It's a title that has a lot of potential for growth, given the sufficient resources,'' Ms. Yates said.

On Monday a senior Administration official said the White House would wait until after Nov. 7, the deadline for the Guatemala plan to be carried out. But then a White House spokesman corrected him and said the official position is that no decision has been made. **********For weeks the White House has been trying to decide how to pursue the President's hard-line goals in Nicaragua while also seeming to support the Central American peace process, even though it is based on an agreement that Mr. Reagan has characterized as ''fatally flawed.'' **********Some officials are convinced that Congress will not renew aid to the contras as long as the Nicaraguans seem to be complying with the regional peace accord. At the same time, a White House official said, the President remains adamant. **********''We're caught in a box,'' the official said today. ''He won't be satisfied until we have a full American-style democracy there, and he doesn't think the Sandinistas are capable of that.'' **********Officials said Nancy Reagan had been urging her husband's senior aides to find a solution to the dilemma, ''to get him out of trouble on this issue,'' one official said. Worry About Harsh Language **********A senior White House official acknowledged that the President's harsh language might not be helpful to the White House when it does ask Congress for renewed contra aid. But he said Mr. Reagan and the national security adviser, Frank C. Carlucci, believed the harsh tone was needed to convince the contras that the United States has not abandoned them. That, the official said, would help keep desertion rates low. **********When the United States cut off all official military aid to the contras, in 1985 and 1986, the contra forces actually expanded dramatically. **********As he has before, Mr. Reagan set out a list of demands the Sandinistas must meet to satisfy him. **********''Open up the jails and let the thousands of political prisoners free, let the exiles come home, allow freedom of worship, free labor unions, a free economy,'' he said, repeating demands he has made before. **********But then Mr. Reagan added a new one. ''Dissolve the so-called neighborhood watch committees,'' he said, apparently referring to the Sandinista Defense Committees. Modeled After Cuban System **********The committees, called ''the eyes and ears of the revolution,'' operate in every neighborhood and help the Government maintain control. They distribute food ration cards, supervise registration for the military draft and monitor any dissident behavior. **********The Guatemala peace plan does not mention those committees, and officials believe the Sandinistas would be reluctant to disband them. Verifying that they had been disbanded would be difficult in any case, they added. The committees are modeled after a similar system in Cuba."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/25/world/compromise-seen-in-us-europe-trade-fight.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1987-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 567, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPROMISE SEEN IN U.S.-EUROPE TRADE FIGHT", "print_headline": "COMPROMISE SEEN IN U.S.-EUROPE TRADE FIGHT", "body_text": " **********The United States and the European Community appeared to be edging toward a compromise today in a conflict over feed-grain sales to Spain that has threatened to develop into an Atlantic trade war. **********''It looks like an agreement may be coming,'' a European official said early this afternoon as European and American negotiators were in a second day of talks at the office of the United States special trade representative, Clayton K.

The duties would affect all 12 countries.  The Europeans, in turn, have threatened to hit back with a new high levy on American shipments of corn gluten feed, a byproduct of corn milling, that is fed to cows and chickens in Europe. **********The United States duties are to be assessed on European products, valued at about $400 million, that include low-priced wine, high-priced brandy, gin, canned ham, endives, olives, carrots and brie and some other cheeses. **********Because many of these products are popular with young American professionals, the conflict has been jocularly referred to as the ''yuppie trade war.''

''This year,'' said the publisher, James S.

He has been smoothing the way for his sales force with quarterly delivery of baskets, worth as much as $50, filled with food, wine and kitchenware. These go to about 350 advertiser and agency decision-makers on the level of those who don't answer their own phones. **********Those making smaller decisions are invited to join groups of 20 for a cooking lesson in the magazine's test kitchen and a dinner in the dining room afterward. About 20 of these sessions are held a month. **********Mr. Prince's budget in 1986 was $500,000 but that included the cost of audience research the magazine purchased. **********Mr. Berrien, 35, and his associate might well typify the audience the magazine is trying to reach. The publisher calls them ''the people who work hard and want to play hard.'' They are people who can knowledgeably discuss the better restaurants and good wine years. **********''We treat food as theater,'' Mr. Prince said. **********''This is a magazine about fun,'' Mr. Berrien said.  And the well-fed but trim twosome noted that part of the fun of dining out is listening in on conversations at neighboring tables. To understand that is to appreciate the new campaign that will break in Adweek and Marketing and Media Decisions later this month. **********It goes like this: on top of a picture of beautifully served food go such bits of dialogue as ''Sometimes I really think you go too far!'' ''What's the matter? All I said was, 'Don't you think I need an answering machine for my car phone?' '' **********Or ''Jean and Rodney are going to St. Barts. Kathy and Malcolm are going to Moorea.

''Can't we find an obscure place that isn't known?'' **********The idea, Mr. Prince said, ''is to let advertisers eavesdrop on our readers.'' **********The print advertising campaign in the trade press, on which at least $250,000 will be spent during the rest of the year, will augment the freeloading events, not replace them. **********The advertising was created by Ogilvy & Mather, which gives good service to this relatively small spender since Ogilvy is also the prime agency of American Express and the company's other magazines, Travel & Leisure and New York Woman. **********The interesting thing about all three is that together they add very little to the company's bottom line, but, Mr. Berrien notes, their editorial raison d'etre is to get the reader to spend money for things that can be paid for with American Express Cards. **********Food & Wine had a 500,000 circulation rate base when acquired in 1984 and 505 pages of advertising. This year it has a 750,000 rate base and will have more than 750 pages of ads. **********Much of the growth is due to repositioning as the fun magazine for the younger and more affluent in a niche between Gourmet and Bon Appetit. The advertising theme line had been ''The magazine for young gourmets.''

O'CONNELL; William B. O'Connell is president of the United States League of Savings Institutions.", "body_text": " **********IN a quiet setting in Stamford, Conn., there is a group of seven men who make up the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Although this group has a profound influence on the economic life of the country, the members are not publicly elected, nor appointed by or answerable to any elected official body. **********Nonetheless, the board has issued rules that sometimes go against the expressed will of Congress. Over the years, the standard-setting body has had a long history of conflict with public policy. **********This thwarting of Congressional will continues today. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, Congress began to deregulate the nation's financial institutions, dismantling laws and regulations under which banks and savings institutions had operated since the 1930's. While the need for deregulation is widely accepted, it has not been established without costs and strains on the financial system. **********In an era of debilitating Federal budget deficits, financial institutions themselves have borne the brunt of the costs of deregulation. In response, Congress has on several occasions enacted measures designed to stretch these costs over a period of years, affording the nation's financial institutions the opportunity to work through these fragile times. **********The board has decided that it knows better than Congress and has determined that financial institutions should not be afforded the opportunities granted by law to adjust to a deregulated environment. It is ironic that many of the financial institutions that failed in recent years were reporting stellar performance under generally accepted accounting principles up to the time they collapsed. **********These are examples of the board's usurpation of the public policy-making role: *********** In the early 1980's, double-digit interest rates caused huge losses at many of the country's savings banks and savings and loan associations. In 1982, Congress passed the Net Worth Certificate program whereby the Federal deposit insurance agencies, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, were authorized to purchase capital certificates from affected institutions. This program was designed to buy time for such institutions to return to health when interest rates declined to more traditional levels. The wisdom of Congress was borne out by the fact that most of the institutions that were allowed to use the Net Worth Certificates have returned to health, saving the Federal insurance agencies billions of dollars. Although Congress mandated that such certificates would count as capital or net worth of the institutions that issued them, the board's staff determined in 1983 that they would not count as such. As a result, many institutions did not participate in the program, and some failed. *********** Agriculture is going through a tough period and this has translated into problems for the commercial banks that serve the farmers. In an effort to buy time for such banks in the same manner as had earlier been used for savings institutions, the 1987 Banking Act allows banks to write off losses on agricultural loans over a period of up to 10 years, rather than having to recognize them immediately. While the board has not addressed this question yet, we are assured informally by the staff that it will not go along with the Congressionally authorized forbearance. *********** Two-thirds of the savings institutions insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation have an investment in that corporation's fund known as the Secondary Reserve. For years, institutions carried this investment on their books as an asset. Earlier this year, Federal regulators said they would have to write off this investment because of the weak condition of the insurance agency. The accounting board concurred and even took the remarkable position that the seizure of this asset by a Federal agency was an ordinary rather than an extraordinary accounting event - an important distinction in the rarefied world of accountants. Congress, however, rightly thought that the regulators' action represented an inequitable expropriation from the institutions that held the investment. In the Competitive Equality Banking Act, signed Aug. 10, Congress ordered that the appropriated investment be paid back over the next six years. Despite this action, the board refused to retract its position and allow institutions to restore the investment as an asset on their books. In so doing it dismissed the arguments of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the primary Federal regulator for savings institutions. **********IT is unsettling to have a small private body of accountants overriding the Federal board, turning into supplicants board members who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. **********I am not advocating that weak banks or savings institutions be allowed to project a false sense of health. Any of the measures I have mentioned have been authorized by Congress and must be clearly disclosed to the regulators as well as to shareholders so they can see the condition of each institution with and without the helping measures that Congress has allowed. **********Nor am I advocating that the board, which was set up by the accounting profession to avoid government regulation, should be disbanded and accountants brought under Federal regulation. If the board is not more cognizant of the public policy implications of its actions, however, it risks that very outcome."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/05/business/company-news-investor-reduces-rorer-holdings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Investor Reduces Rorer Holdings", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Investor Reduces Rorer Holdings", "body_text": " **********The British investor Alan E.

Applications are down significantly, and the schools are scrambling for candidates. In 1974, when medical school applications peaked, there were 2.8 applicants for each available slot; now there are just about 2 prospects for each seat. The peak for law schools was not until fall 1980, but the valley is just as deep. Applications to law schools declined about 17 percent between 1981 and 1985, according to William J. Kennish, consultant to the Law School Admissions Council, although they increased slightly in 1986. **********Some professional schools are trying to attract nontraditional candidates. The Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York has been trying to lure non-science majors. ''A broader-based humanities education may produce physicians who are better able to relate to patients as people,'' explained Dr. Barry D. Stimmel, academic dean at Mount Sinai. This year the school began an ambitious humanities recruiting program. Colleges were invited to enroll five humanities sophomores in a pre-med curriculum of minimum science with students spending summers at Mount Sinai. Admission to medical study is guaranteed if they maintain a B average. **********Medical schools have sought minority students for two decades - with limited success - but that competition has really put the squeeze on predominantly black medical schools. **********''We look on the opening of medical schools as very positive, but it did make things more competititive for us,'' said Dr. David Satcher, president of Meharry Medical School in Nashville, which is 85 percent black. Meharry's recruiting efforts begin early. The college has a summer program for freshmen and sophomores at feeder colleges, and even a program for selected high schools. **********Over all, the number of medical school applicants has declined partly because of the high cost of a medical education and the increasing limits on doctors' incomes, Dr. Stimmel said. He added: ''In New York City it's not unusual to graduate owing $50,000. Government control and the rise of H.M.O.'s limit autonomy and income for physicians. There's been enough in the press that the message is finally getting across to medical school applicants.'' **********The effect of bad publicity is also felt by law school recruiters. ''We've been hurt by the notion bantered about that there are too many lawyers,'' grouses Suzy L. Golden, acting director of law school admissions at Golden Gate College. ''There probably is a glut, but if you're good, there are never too many.'' Golden Gate has cut the size of its entering class so it can afford to take only the better students. The entering class this fall at the urban San Francisco school is 130. In 1982 it was 300. **********Schools like the University of Toledo law school are banking on increased scholarships to stabilize enrollment. The Ohio school of 600 offers 15 full and 20 partial grants to new students, double the grants given in 1982. **********''One must be inventive,'' said Ms. Golden. ''Although the decline in applicants seems to be leveling off, we've all learned a lot. We've learned you've got to determine where your market is, who you are and what you have to offer.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/15/business/south-africa-sale-by-ford-will-give-blacks-big-stake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 764, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA SALE BY FORD WILL GIVE BLACKS BIG STAKE", "print_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA SALE BY FORD WILL GIVE BLACKS BIG STAKE", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company is poised to sell its South African interests in a complex deal that would give its predominantly black work force a major share of the business, but leave its products still available there. **********The company has been under intense pressure to pull out of the country to protest the Government's apartheid policies.

That could put the Cahners purchase price at $45 million to $60 million or more. Cahners declined to commment, and so did Syd Silverman, the owner of Variety. **********The acquisition by Cahners will end an era of family ownership for Variety, which was founded in 1905 by Mr. Silverman's grandfather, Sime. Today three of Mr. Silverman's four children still work at the paper, housed in an unprepossessing Manhattan brownstone on West 46th Street, just a block from where Sime Silverman started. **********For 40 years Variety has been a staple of the entertainment industry, and it remains the only trade paper to report box-office grosses on a weekly basis for a vast number of the movie theaters in major American cities. **********Although Variety started as a film trade paper, it now also reports on the television, cable and music industries. Despite this diversification, its headlines and terminology - ''legs'' for a film that is a long-running hit and ''boffo'' for a box-office success - are part of the Hollywood language. **********For years, entrepreneurs eager to gain leverage and glamour in the entertainment business have tried to buy the publication. Among those rumored to have been interested in Variety recently was the Times Mirror Company. **********''The pressure escalated after the Broadcasting and Billboard deals,'' Mr. Silverman said yesterday in a telephone interview from his home in Westchester County. **********Times Mirror bought Broadcasting magazine for $75 million last November. Billboard Publications, which issues the leading trade journal in the music recording field, was bought for $100 million in March by Affiliated Publications, corporate parent of The Boston Globe. Family Members' Contracts **********Mr. Silverman emphasized that neither he nor his children were leaving Variety. He has a five-year contract with an option to renew, he said, and his four children, including one who is a college senior, all have five-year contracts. **********Mr. Silverman acknowledged that Cahners made the most attractive offer but added that he also liked the fact that there was no conflict of interest because Cahners has no broadcasting properties. **********''There is not a sale but a merger,'' Mr. Silverman said. ''This will make Variety stronger with all corporate resources.'' **********Noting that Cahners reports to its parent company in England, he said, ''That will take some of the pressure off us. There is someone between us and the muzzlers on Wall Street'' -an allusion to the pressure for quarterly earnings improvement. **********''But we will certainly do our share,'' he added. **********There are roughly 125 people on the Variety staff, with offices in New York, Hollywood, Toronto and Paris. Daily Variety has a circulation of 22,000, and Weekly Variety has a circulation of 33,000. The latter figure represents a decline of 4,000 in the last few years. **********Mr. Silverman attributed the circulation drop to cutbacks at the television networks, among other factors. However, some critics said yesterday that Variety faced more serious competition, not only from The Hollywood Reporter but from new publications such as Electronic Media, a relatively new weekly that is owned by Crain Communications. **********Cahners, based in Newton, Mass., generated $267 million in sales from its operations last year. The company does not break out magazine profits separately. **********Cahners also owns the Cahners Exposition Group, which puts on more than 200 trade shows worldwide, as well as R. R. Bowker, which publishes magazines and directories for libraries. **********Last year it acquired Technical Publishing from Dun & Bradstreet for $250 million.

Meeting behind closed doors for three hours, the Democrats tentatively approved a dozen tax changes that would meet about half of their goal. **********Only a few of the $6.3 billion in tax changes approved today were considered sweeping, including a three-year extension of the expiring 3 percent excise tax on local and long-distance telephone service. **********By and large, the proposals affect only certain taxpayers and businesses. Among them are new ''user fees'' for certain Government services, changes in the rules for corporate estimated taxes, elimination of scheduled reductions in estate and gift tax rates, and the curtailment of an estate tax loophole. Search Now Becomes Harder **********Democrats planned to continue work on the package on Thursday, expecting that the next $6 billion would be harder to find and the proposals more controversial. Their plan was to spend Thursday sifting through unused ideas from the Reagan Administration's original income tax overhaul proposals. But aides thought few would be adopted, given that they were rejected by Congress during the two-year tax overhaul debate. **********Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he was disappointed that the Republicans had chosen not to participate. But he said the Democrats felt a responsibility to put together a $12 billion tax bill as part of an overall deficit reduction package in order to avoid $23 billion in automatic spending cuts as set forth by the recently modified Gramm-Rudman law. **********Republicans have sought to reduce the $12 billion revenue figure, asking the Democrats to cut more spending instead. But various Republican compromise offers were rejected today by House Democrats, and Republicans signaled their refusal to participate in drafting the tax bill. **********Representative John J. Duncan of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans prefer that the automatic spending cuts occur rather than ''disproportionately increasing the taxpayers' burden.'' Tough Going for Democrats **********Without Republican participation, the Democrats face what they admit will be a tough battle in getting a tax bill passed on the House floor, particularly if President Reagan refuses to bend from his strong stance against new taxes. **********''I'm not comfortable doing it,'' Mr. Rostenkowski told reporters. ''I would prefer to have bipartisan support. But I don't have the luxury of waiting.'' **********Asked whether he thought a bill could pass the House, he said, ''I don't know.'' **********''It could all end up being an exercise in futility,'' added Representative Brian J. Donnelly, a Massachusetts Democrat on the committee. **********Democrats are trying to fashion a tax package that would minimize objections from other Democrats and avoid the types of tax changes that would bring an almost certain veto from President Reagan. Many of the changes approved today by the Democrats came directly from Mr. Reagan's 1988 budget proposals. And the committee's decision to look at income tax changes followed recent suggestions by James C. Miller 3d, the Administration's budget director. **********Senior aides to Mr. Rostenkowski said the committee does not intend to consider major increases in excise taxes or increases in income tax rates, the latter of which President Reagan has repeatedly pledged to veto. **********Mr. Rostenkowski said he hoped to finish the tax bill by the end of next week, along with a bill that would make hundreds of ''technical changes'' to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. **********On the Senate side, the Finance Committee is set to begin considering similar legislation on Thursday, but no specific proposals were expected to be discussed until a later session. The Latest Changes **********These were among the changes approved today: *********** An extension for three years of the excise tax on telephone service, which had been scheduled to expire at the end of this year. *********** A requirement that employers pay a payroll tax on cash tips received by waiters and other service personnel. *********** A repeal of the current exemptions from highway trust fund excise taxes for buses and state and local governments. *********** A new user fee for each ''determination letter'' and ''private letter ruling'' issued by the Internal Revenue Service to taxpayers. *********** An increase in various fees charged by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. *********** An increase in various fees charged by the Customs Service. *********** An extension and expansion of the Internal Revenue Service effort to collect past-due Federal agency debts from taxpayers. *********** A freeze in the gift and estate tax rates at current levels, rather than letting them drop next year as previously scheduled. *********** A curtailment of a loophole in the estate tax law for sales of stock to Employee Stock Ownership Plans. *********** A modification of corporate estimated tax rules in a way that would force certain companies to speed up their estimated tax payments during the year. *********** An extension of the present Federal Unemployment Tax Act (F.U.T.A.) tax rate of 6.2 percent of the first $7,000 in wages paid to an employee for three years, through 1990, rather than a drop to 6.0 percent as previously scheduled. **********Also approved was a provision to give individuals and businesses some relief this year from more stringent estimated tax rules stemming from the 1986 tax act.

R. Jayewardene, officials from both sides said. Agreement on the issue would mean that Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jayewardene could sign an accord on the peace plan as early as next week, officials said. **********The package of proposals is said to involve key concessions by President Jayewardene, who appears to have compromised on his longstanding refusal to unite the north and east in an autonomous province. **********The Tamils would be expected to surrender their weapons and stop using the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, home to 52 million Indian Tamils, as a base for their activities. Tamil Population Is Split **********''It's very close to being tied up,'' one Indian official said. But he also cautioned reporters that ''the last part of the negotiations is always the trickiest.'' **********The 16.6 million people of Sri Lanka, an island nation off the southeastern tip of India, are split into two main ethnic groups, the majority Sinhalese, who for the most part are Buddhists, and the Tamils, a minority of about 15 percent who for the most part are Hindus. **********The Tamils of Northern and Eastern Provinces in Sri Lanka have been agitating for increased autonomy since 1956, when the Government acted to make Sinhala the official language. The Tamils have their own language. **********Open warfare began in 1983 when Tamils killed 13 soldiers and rioting followed in which more than 1,000 people were killed. Most of the victims were Tamils. **********The Tamils themselves are split. The north and east, where many of them live, are centers for separatism. However, another sizeable group of Tamils, in the south-central hill country, are not separatists. **********The chief of the main separatist guerrilla group, Velupillai Prabakaran of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, arrived in New Delhi today on an Indian plane for a probable meeting with Mr. Gandhi over the weekend. India Has Acted as Mediator **********The Indian Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Jyotindra Nath Dixit, was also on his way here with details of the proposed accord, officials said. Mr. Dixit and other Indian Embassy officials have had intense talks with President Jayewardene and his aides. **********For several years, India has acted as mediator between the two sides. **********With the approval of the Sri Lankans, an Indian diplomat carried the latest proposals to Mr. Prabakaran at his guerrilla headquarters in the Tamil-dominated Northern Province. The militant leader has been there for several months directing rebel operations against Sri Lankan troops. The Government troops made major gains in an offensive this summer. **********Representatives of the Sri Lankan militants could not be reached for comment on the sudden developments. Officials here, who had been in touch with them, said they had ''responded positively.'' #70-Member Council Foreseen Mr. Jayewardene wants India to be a guarantor of the accord, which officials say envisions an amalgamation of Eastern and Northern Provinces with one chief minister or top elected official, one governor and 70 members in the unified provincial council. **********Thirty-six lawmakers are to be picked from Northern Province and 34 from Eastern Province under the accord, which would have to be approved in a referendum in the two provinces within one year. **********Mr. Jayewardene had resisted the plan to unite the two territories, arguing that the population of Eastern Province was equally divided among Moslems, Sinhalese and Tamils. **********But there are still questions of whether Mr. Jayewardene will be able to convince hard-liners in his ruling United National Party on his reported moves. One important leader whose cooperation is crucial to the success of the plan is the Prime Minister, Ranasinghe Premadasa, who cut short a visit to Japan to return to Colombo. **********Mr. Premadasa is identified with the militant group in the ruling party and has frequently criticized India's role in the Sri Lankan ethnic problem. **********Colombo had denounced a unilateral Indian airdrop of relief supplies on June 4 over the region around Jaffna, capital of Northern Province, calling the Indian action a violation of Sri Lankan sovereignty. Since then, however, the two sides have cooperated in sending food, medical goods and other relief material to the north, where supplies of consumer goods have been disrupted by the civil strife.

Benson has stepped down from his post monitoring the frontier where Soviet culture and politics meet. **********His name is better known in Moscow's literary circles than in New York's, but it was Mr. Benson's knowledge and persistence that wrought the 1985 cultural exchange agreement sending the Bolshoi Ballet to the United States and bringing Vladimir Horowitz to Moscow, where the audience wept at the music he made. And at a time when members of Congress and Administration aides were clamoring for greater security, espousing the view of an embassy as a fortress, it was Mr. Benson, 60 years old, the head of the embassy's cultural and press offices, who did as much as possible to get himself out of the fortress. **********His excellent command of Russian and nuanced knowledge of Soviet culture was nurtured in of scores of evenings in Russian kitchens, of walks in the springtime mud of Peredelkino with writers like Anatoly Rybakov, of hours watching the crowds at the graves of Boris Pasternak or the balladeer Vladimir Vysotsky. ''Ray's little black book would be the best entry to contemporary Soviet culture,'' a Western European diplomat said. **********''He knew everybody,'' one of his American colleagues said. ''If there was a rumor of anything happening in the cultural world here, he could find out about it instantly.'' **********Mr. Benson is not the only senior diplomat who is leaving. Four of the top nine officers, including Richard Combs Jr., the charge d'affaires, and Adm. Ronald Kurth, the military attache, ended their tours this summer. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock Jr. and seven other top officers are new within the last year. This summer's turnover rate for the embassy over all is about 70 percent. **********For many of those leaving, the last two years were a professional and personal maelstrom, their duties defined by summitry and spy scandals, their family lives sprinkled with worries about spy dust, microwaves and Chernobyl. **********Like some of the others who have left, Mr. Benson told friends he felt a bit battered and disillusioned by the last year of turmoil. Just as the professional staff was recovering from its months-long trial of taking over the housekeeping chores after the withdrawal of the Russian staff last October, a furor erupted over breaches of embassy security. Many embassy officials complained that they were being made scapegoats for security agreements made years before. **********Mr. Benson made little reference to the demoralizing one-two punch of the last year, but showed a brusque pride in the way he and his colleagues had come through that period. **********''Imagine telling the bank officers in the Chase Manhattan building that from one day to the next they'll have no help keeping their building clean, that they'll have no drivers or runners, that the servants at their homes are gone, that they'll have nothing except water, light and central heating,'' he said. **********''Imagine telling them that one day and having them open for business the next,'' he said. ''That's what happened to us. That's what we did.'' **********Mr. Benson first saw the Soviet Union as a 5-year-old returning from the United States with his Russian-born parents in 1932. After a year, his parents separated, and his mother took him back to the United States. He returned here 42 years later. **********Mr. Benson has been well positioned to judge what Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies mean for freedom of expression in the Soviet Union. **********''Lots of things have happened here that are more optical than real, more audible than substantive,'' Mr. Benson said of the recent changes in the Soviet Union. ''But some things are substantive. For 70 years, they were running along on an ideology that would, they said, effect change. To admit that this is not so is a staggering task.'' **********After his retirement, Mr. Benson will become a visiting professor at Middlebury College, heading an effort by a consortium of colleges to build a new Soviet-American student-exchange program."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/30/business/business-digest-friday-january-30-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 663, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, JANUARY 30, 1987", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: FRIDAY, JANUARY 30, 1987", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********A revamping of the nation's financial system was proposed by E.

And books are ordered - or passed up - on the basis of whim, jacket design, pressure from salesmen or any number of other subjective criteria. **********Moreover, they are one of the few products returnable for full credit, much to the despair of the many publishers who would like to end that time-honored practice. **********Harcourt Brace Jovanovich tried to change it in 1981.

She called the growth ''robust,'' noting that it was accompanied by such modest inflation that there was no longer any chance that the Federal Reserve would need to tighten monetary policy in the near future. **********At the Commerce Department, Robert Ortner, Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, suggested that Monday's stock market collapse, which he attributed mainly to ''market psychology and computerized trading,'' would probably have only a ''minor'' effect on the economy. **********''It may have some effect on consumer spending and/or on business investment,'' Mr. Ortner said in a prepared statement. ''But the size of the impact depends on how strong the economy is otherwise. If the economy were already weakening, the impact might be large, but in a strengthening economy the effect probably will be small.'' **********He also noted that, while the stock market was a fairly reliable predictor of the course of the economy, it had flashed a clear warning of only four of the eight postwar recessions and that, in 1962, 1966 and 1977, major drops in the market were not followed by recessions. **********Other economists, however, suggested that the plunge in stocks could cut economic growth by up to two percentage points over the next year. With the pick-up in activity this summer, the economy needs only to rise at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the current quarter to reach the Reagan Administration's target of 3.2 percent growth for the year. Food Offset by Energy **********The price report for September showed that a rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in the price of food - a fluctuation that once again stemmed mainly from the cost of fruit and vegetables - was largely offset by a downturn in energy prices and a smaller increase for shelter. **********''At least in the short run, this should cool people's fears of inflation,'' said Patrick C. Jackman, a senior Labor Department price official, of today's report. He predicted that, unless there was some special shock, such as a disruption of Middle East oil supplies, consumer inflation would be in the 4.5-to-5-percent range for this year, up from 1.1 percent last year and from an average of 3.9 percent for 1982 through 1985. **********The energy index, which had jumped 1.7 percent in August, fell five-tenths of 1 percent last month with fuel oil, natural gas, electricity and gasoline all showing declines, the Labor Department said. **********A sharp nine-tenths of 1 percent decline in the lightly weighted ''other goods and services'' category also helped minimize the price index's overall rise of five-tenths of a point. A major factor in the category's decline was a seasonally adjusted drop in tuitions, school fees, books and supplies. Before adjustment, however, tuition rose 5 percent. Housing Cost Unchanged **********The cost of housing, which accounts for 43 percent of the price index, was unchanged last month after a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in August. Charges fell for out-of-town lodging and fuels and other utilities, including local and intrastate telephone service. **********Transportation costs, easing somewhat because of a sharp downward swing in motor fuels, rose two-tenths of 1 percent, after a seven-tenths increase in August. September's decline in gasoline, though small, was the first this year; prices jumped 21.4 percent in the eight months through August. **********The price of used cars also fell for the first time this year, but prices of new cars rose by the same one-tenth of 1 percent average that has prevailed so far in 1987. **********The index for apparel and upkeep rose 1.1 percent last month, reflecting the introduction of fall and winter merchandise. Medical care and entertainment costs both rose five-tenths of 1 percent. Few Big Food Increases **********Grocery store food prices climbed six-tenths of 1 percent after falling in July and August but, apart from fruit and vegetables, there were few big increases. A prominent exception was milk, which jumped 1.9 percent, the biggest increase since May 1980. **********Viewed another way, the price index report showed that commodities rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month while service inflation fell to zero from six-tenths in August. **********Before rounding, the price index's increase last month was 0.1751313, a level that, if maintained and compounded for 12 months, would produce an annual inflation rate of 2.1 percent. **********Before seasonal adjustment, the price index rose five-tenths of 1 percent, three-tenths higher than the widely cited adjusted figure. Mr. Jackman said he could not find in his records any previous month in which the difference has been so great. **********The price index for urban consumers now stands at 344.4, which means that a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in 1967 now costs $34.44. Hefty Rise in Final Sales **********Consumer spending played an important role in the $35.9 billion, or 3.8 percent, rate of increase in the third-quarter G.N.P., which included a hefty 6.2 percent advance in final sales while investment in inventories fell. This, said Mr. Ortner, was ''a combination that usually augurs well for activity in the coming quarters.'' **********New-car sales were the main reason for the sharp rise in consumer spending, but Mr. Ortner acknowledged that the 19.9 percent rate of increase for such sales was too torrid to be maintained. **********The slowdown in inventory investment mostly reflected a drop in new-car production. Lower automobile assemblies help cut dealers' inventories but trimmed about one-half point from G.N.P. growth. **********Growth in capital spending was also sizable, but residential investment slipped as higher interest rates cut into housing starts, today's report showed. Net Exports Down **********Real exports swelled to a rate of $430.6 billion, from $414.5 billion, but imports rose somewhat more. As a result, net exports of goods and services fell $5.2 billion further into the red, to a rate of $137.9 billion. **********However, it was a big jump in imports of oil, by $19.3 billion in the quarter, that more than accounted for the deterioration. Excluding oil, the real merchandise trade balance continued a strong improvement, Mr. Ortner said. The trade sector is increasingly counted on to drive the nation's economic expansion, taking over from the American consumer. **********Today's report also showed that the nation's savings rate - savings as a percentage of disposable income -remained at the second-quarter level of 3 percent. **********Inflation fell as gauged by two G.N.P.-related measures, as well as by the price index. The G.N.P. fixed-weighted price index climbed at a 2.7 percent rate in the third quarter, down from 4.1 percent in the spring. The ''implicit price deflator'' eased to a 2.4 percent rate in the September quarter from 3.5 percent in the preceding three months."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/27/business/credit-markets-bonds-regain-part-of-losses.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1987-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 835, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonds Regain Part of Losses", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Bonds Regain Part of Losses", "body_text": " **********Treasury note and bond prices yesterday recovered some of their losses of earlier in the week, as the Government completed a three-part, $25 billion note financing. **********Securities dealers said that demand yesterday for two-year and four-year Treasury notes sold earlier in the week was good enough to benefit yesterday's $7.25 billion auction of seven-year notes. The new 7 percent issue due in 1994 sold with an average yield of 7.04 percent, and was offered late in the day at about 7.03 percent. **********The modest rise of about one-quarter point in Treasury bond prices lent a good tone to the corporate and tax-exempt markets, where prices rose slightly. Corporate debt financings included at least five new issues totaling more than $600 million. 'A Lot of Money Around' **********''The seven-year auction had no bearing on any new bullish or bearish attitude in the market,'' said Daniel T. Napoli, president of Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc. He said that trading activity in the Treasury market remained light, ''but the simple fact is that there is just a lot of money around.'' **********Charles F. Wills, director of fixed-income research at the Provident National Bank in Philadelphia, said that the recent pattern of modest, sustained economic growth does not point to any significant changes in interest rates. ''The big moves in rates are behind us'' he said, ''and good performance now will depend on technical analysis, things like credit analysis and reading indentures to select high-coupon bonds not likely to be refunded.'' **********Although several securities dealers said foreign demand for the seven-year notes was meager, they noted that Treasury bond prices benefited as the dollar stabilized against the yen. A few traders noted there were rumors that the Japanese Ministry of Finance had asked major Japanese trading firms to stop speculative selling of the dollar. **********Mr. Napoli said that ''there seems to be general agreement that the dollar will weaken,'' a perception that causes many foreign investors to concentrate on debt issues in currencies that are expected to appreciate or that offer higher yields than Treasury issues. ''But once there is some semblance of stability, we could see a rush back into the dollar'' and some greater overseas demand for Treasury issues, he said. Prediction by Baker **********According to some analysts, doubts about the dollar's stability may persist until there is more evidence -not just predictions - that the American trade deficit is contracting. Economists are now awaiting the April 14 release of the Commerce Department's February trade data. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d recently predicted in a television interview that the American trade deficit would contract by $15 billion to $20 billion this year. **********By the time trading stopped in New York yesterday, the Treasury's closely watched 7 1/2 percent bonds due in 2016 were offered at 99 14/32, to yield 7.55 percent. The bellwether long-term bond was offered at 99 26/ 32 last Friday, and its yield remains well within the range of 7.42 percent to 7.61 percent that has prevailed since Feb. 11. **********Among new issues, the two-year and four-year offerings were trading with higher prices and lower yields than the averages set at their auctions earlier this week. The 6 3/8 percent issue due in 1989 was offered to yield 6.39 percent, down from 6.43 percent at auction Tuesday, while the 6 3/4 percent issue due in 1991 was at 6.72 percent, down from 6.79 percent Wednesday. Money Supply Rises **********Prices of debt issues were little changed after the Federal Reserve announced a $1.2 billion rise in the M-1 money supply measure, to $740.2 billion, in the week ended March 16. Although M-1 growth has been a robust 16.7 percent during the last year, it declined in February and has expanded more slowly in March. The M-2 money supply measure, which is more closely watched by Fed officials, also fell last month and is expected to show slow growth in March when complete monthly data is published April 16. **********Other Fed data showed that financial institutions borrowed an average of $432 million at the Fed discount window in the two-week reserve accounting period ended March 25, after excluding extended loans to troubled institutions. Borrowings were up from $383 million in the previous two weeks, but the increase was not large enough to suggest any change in monetary policy, analysts said. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of seven-year notes:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)       $   Average Price   99.772     Average Yield   7.04%     Low Price   99.772     High Yield   7.04%     High Price   99.881     Low Yield   7.02%     Accepted at low price   62%     Total applied for$26,944,383     Accepted   $7,325,769     N.Y. applied for   $24,553,778     N.Y. accepted   $6,553,778     Noncompetitive   $248,000     Interest set at   7%          The 7-year notes mature April 15, 1994."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/15/business/sales-of-us-built-cars-fall-15-percent-in-period.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1987-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 693, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sales of U.S.-Built Cars Fall 15 Percent in Period", "print_headline": "Sales of U.S.-Built Cars Fall 15 Percent in Period", "body_text": " **********Sales of new American-made cars fell 15 percent, to 193,139 units, in the first 10 days of April, the eight manufacturers reported today.

Weaker Than Projections **********Analysts said the decline, after an apparent improvement at the end of March, seemed to signal that consumer demand for cars and light trucks was fundamentally weaker than the companies had forecast. The question, the analysts said, was whether the weakness was only temporary or a signal of a longer-term decline in demand for high-priced durable goods. **********''I'm beginning to think we are looking at some fundamental weakness in the market,'' said Edward J. Sullivan of Chase Econometrics. ''The effect of the new tax law was gone by March, and we should have seen stronger sales.'' **********But Susan G. Jacobs of Merrill Lynch Economics said she expected the sales lull to be temporary. ''I think the current sales pace reflects a hesitancy on the part of consumers as they adjust to the new tax law,'' she said. She added that she expected improved sales by late spring, with an annual sales rate of 7.5 million to 8 million cars a year. **********The General Motors Corporation suffered the biggest drop, as it has most of this year. G.M.'s sales of 98,792 domestic cars represented a 24 percent decline from a year ago. **********The Chrysler Corporation's car sales were down 12 percent, to 26,901 units, while the Ford Motor Company reported only a 2.5 percent decline, to 57,503. The American Motors Corporation sold 715 cars, a drop of 55 percent, while Volkswagen of America's sales were off 41 percent, to 1,100. **********Sales for Honda of America increased 58 percent, to 4,793, because of higher production at its Marysville, Ohio, plant. The Nissan Motor Company, which makes cars in Smyrna, Tenn., reported a gain of 45 percent, to 2,637. The Toyota Motor Corporation, which began making cars late last year in the United States, sold 698 in the early-April period. Truck Gains for Ford, Chrysler **********G.M.'s light-truck sales declined 11.6 percent, to 37,552, but both Ford and Chrysler reported strong gains in the period. Ford sold 38,647 vehicles, an increase of 11.3 percent, for a light-truck total that surpassed G.M.'s. Chrysler gained 17 percent, with 15,723 sales. **********For the year through April 10, 1,259,807 cars have been sold, a drop of 12.5 percent from the 1986 level. But light-truck sales of 946,760 represent an increase of 3 percent from last year's level and are an indication of the continuing shift by consumers from cars to such vehicles as mini-vans, which are classified as trucks. **********G.M.'s sales may improve as its new Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta models and a new full-size pickup move into the market. But for the year to date, its market share has declined to 51 percent, from 57.1 percent in the 1986 period. **********Ford's market share has grown to 28 percent, from 24.6 percent, and Chrysler's is up to 13.7 percent, from 13.2 percent.

The decline occurred during a rise in the overall market. **********Officials of the trade commission acknowledged that the study did not analyze the long-term price effects of the legislation that was passed into law, but rather measured the short-term reaction of investors to the proposed restrictions on takeovers. 'Significant' Decline Cited **********The announcement of the Cuomo bill ''resulted in a highly significant'' statistical decline in the market value of the companies, said Laurence Schumann, the author of the study. ''Clearly, the bill was viewed by the market as harmful to shareholders.'' **********The study comes at a time when sentiment is rising in Congress to curb hostile takeovers on a national level, rather than just state by state. The insider trading scandal has uncovered abuses on Wall Street of the takeover process, prompting several Senate and House committees to consider legislation that would make hostile takeovers more difficult to complete. **********So far, the Reagan Administration has supported few changes in the existing takeover laws. In fact, the trade commission's study buttresses the preference by the Reagan Administration for less regulated markets, and further deregulation. Chairman's View **********''This study supports what I've been saying all along,'' said Daniel Oliver, chairman of the F.T.C., ''that Government intervention with the free market is the principal source of restriction on competition.'' **********In its study, the commission says that other research into hostile takeovers had shown that Federal and state restrictions - more than 35 states have restrictive takeover statutes - increase the price that raiders must pay for target companies. These studies have often been used as a theoretical basis for states imposing such restrictions, and a rationale for arguing that such measures help, rather than hurt, the shareholder. **********But Mr. Schumann argues that studying only successful takeovers fails to measure the impact of restrictive regulation on the broad spectrum of shareholders in companies that could become takeover targets. He adds that the market's reaction on all takeover targets to any possible legislation is a more accurate reflection of whether takeover curbs are advantageous or disadvantageous to shareholders. **********As such, the commission's study focused on all of the 94 publicly traded companies that fall under the jurisdiction of the 1985 New York State law - companies incorporated in New York that also maintain their principal executive offices in the state. That list included such major corporations as the International Business Machines Corporation, Macy's, Mobil, CBS, Corning Glass, International Paper, McGraw-Hill and Grumman. **********Both the effects of the bill and its constitutionality have yet to be proved, said Arthur Fleischer, a takeover attorney with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, ''because I don't think any major New York firm has become the object of a hostile takeover yet.'' #2 Key Curbs in Bill The Cuomo bill, passed by the State Legislature on Dec. 10, 1985, has two primary restrictions. It prohibits anyone who is buying 20 percent or more of a company's stock from ''engaging in any business combination'' with the company for five years, unless approved by the board of directors before the purchase. The bill also requires that in any takeover, all stockholders receive the same price for their shares. **********The Cuomo bill was in fact the second takeover proposal passed by the Legislature in 1985. Earlier that year, the Governor had vetoed a more restrictive bill on constitutional grounds. **********In its study, the F.T.C. noted that after the veto of the first bill on Aug. 13, the stocks of the 94 affected companies rose significantly, confirming that ''the bill was viewed by the market as harming shareholders, and was not in their best interest,'' Mr. Schumann said. **********The F.T.C. concluded that rather than protecting shareholders, the Cuomo bill tends to insulate incumbent managements and favors ''managers at the expense of shareholders.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/business/the-executive-computer-when-you-write-by-committee.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Sandberg-Diment", "pub_date": "1987-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1199, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "When You Write by Committee", "print_headline": "THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER; When You Write by Committee", "body_text": " **********Early in my writing career, I was approached by a film producer to convert Hemingway's ''Hills like White Elephants'' into a television script.

Then the gentleman in charge of production spent an evening in our apartment ''fine-tuning'' the results of my labors. **********I had the good sense to leave the dialogue intact, since it was written by Hemingway. The producer, however, felt it needed ''contemporization.'' His imaginative rewriting continued well past breakfast the following morning. By the end of all this, the short script, altered and revised completely a number of times, had returned to very nearly the exact state in which I had submitted it. Satisfied that it was now ready to be viewed and commented upon by the 32 other people involved in the effort, the gentleman left, manuscript in hand. **********I swore I would never again write by committee. **********This experience flashed through my mind as I opened a software package called For Comment ($195 for the IBM PC and compatibles from Broderbund Software, Inc., San Rafael, Calif. 94903, tel. 415-479-1170). For $995 one can buy the network version of the program, which will accommodate the output of as many as 16 separate authors. The number of reviewers that can be likewise accommodated is not limited by either package, although in both versions the comments of no more than 16 people can be collated with any given document. **********Billed as ''the first review processor,'' For Comment claims to be designed for the legal and teaching professions and those involved in corporate communications, the development of policy statements or any other matters requiring revisions, suggestions and comments by numerous people. My first reaction on hearing this news was that the program must be some kind of sentence-oriented Scrabble. Broderbund is, after all, a game company. It is best known for such digitized thrillers as Blade Runner and such computerized hobby kits as Print Shop, an electronic version of the old rubber-stamp type sets. But no, For Comment is a serious business program, albeit one designed for a specialized niche. **********The software consists of two separate programs packaged together. One program is for authors, the other for reviewers. The major difference between the two is that documents can be originated only through the authors' version. Once a manuscript such as a position paper has been composed, it can then be circulated among a number of reviewers for comment, in one of two ways. **********In offices where personal computers are linked by a local area network, or LAN, reviewers can access a For Comment document they are to study directly. The software supports six different networks, including the IBM PC Network, Novelle's Advanced NetWare and 3 Com's Ether Series. **********Where no network exists, the document is circulated among the reviewers by way of a ''floppynet,'' where a disk containing the document file and a separate floppy containing the reviewers' version of For Comment are passed around. The reason for the two disks is that the reviewers' portion of For Comment takes up 250K of disk space. A document with space-hogging review comments usually cannot be squeezed onto the same disk that the program occupies. Included with the program is an electronic routing screen on which reviewers can each enter a tick indicating that they have worked on the file. **********A WORD processor is needed for a writer to create a document for review. For Comment accepts entries directly from a score of popular word processing programs, including MultiMate, New Word, Nota Bene, Volkswriter 3, WordStar 2000 and WordPerfect, as well as entries presented in ASCII. Thus, an office whose word processing has not been standardized should encounter no major problems utilizing For Comment. However, when a transfer is made through ASCII, as is necessary in importing material from XYWrite, Leading Edge Word Processor and Microsoft Word, formatting will not be transferred along with the text. **********In whatever form the text is entered, once it is on disk, the electronic routing sheet can be made up. More than simply a directive to those who are to comment on the manuscript, the routing screen is a safekeeping device permitting three levels of security. Under the highest security, comments or revisions cannot be changed, even by the reviewer who made the notation. Only the original author of the document is free to discard suggestions or alterations. The provisions of the other two security levels are less stringent. **********Also available is a password security system, possibly a necessity in some LAN-equipped offices. Unfortunately, this system is based on simple five-character strings, and anyone reasonably familiar with computers and determined enough to pry could probably crack its code in relatively short order. **********For that matter, those who suppose any of the current crop of file encryption programs offer meaningful security beyond the level of ordinary office snooping should find the article ''A Survey of Data Insecurity Packages'' in the January 1987 issue of Cryptologia (published by the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Terre Haute, Ind. 47803, tel. 812-877-1511) revealing. **********Once over the password hurdle, legally or otherwise, a reviewer working on a For Comment manuscript marks the document at the point where a note is to apply and enters his or her commentary, which can be up to 60 lines long, in a window that materializes on the lower half of the screen. A second reviewer remarking on the same point enters the further comment in the same place. This second remark appears in the window slightly indented from the first and delineated by a differently colored border. The date, but not the time, and the initials of the reviewer are appended to each comment made. **********The multiple windows utilized by For Comment limit the display of the document to a mere 10 lines whenever notes are inserted. From a visual viewpoint, this approach can make it difficult for a reader to maintain continuity while reviewing the text. Certainly the program is simple enough to learn and use. But employing such an electronic time-shift bull session without exercising considerable care and restraint could easily lead to a great deal of wasted time in producing a corporate communications version of the proverbial elephant designed by committee."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/world/korean-reportedly-saw-waite.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 301, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Korean Reportedly Saw Waite", "print_headline": "Korean Reportedly Saw Waite", "body_text": " **********A Moslem militia representative said today that Terry Waite, the kidnapped British church envoy, was apparently seen by a freed South Korean diplomat while the diplomat was a hostage in Lebanon. **********The militia representative said the diplomat, Do Chae Sung, who was released Oct. 27, had reported seeing a foreign captive who fit Mr. Waite's description. **********The militiaman said Mr. Do had described the hostage as a very tall, bearded man with his hair combed backward.

They have very short memories, and what they are doing is playing with fire. We have not minced our words in telling them this, and we will not remain idle.'' Basis of the Understanding **********There are two pillars to the Phalangist-Palestinian entente, Israeli military sources said. **********The first is money. The Phalangists need cash, and Mr. Arafat, having been thrown out of both Tunisia and Jordan, has no other alternative than to invest his money in buying his way back to an independent base of operation in Lebanon. **********But for the Phalangists, the arrangement is apparently not only good business but also good politics. One of the basic laws of Lebanese politics is that ''my enemy's enemy is my friend.'' **********According to Israeli officials, several key Phalangist leaders, most notably Samir Geagea and Karim Pakradouni, perceive that their main enemies in Lebanon today are the Shiite Moslems. The Shiites are the rising force in Lebanon and a long-term threat to the historical Maronite Christian hegemony of the legal Lebanese political structure. **********Israel twice sent naval patrol vessels last week to turn back Cypriot ferries sailing from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Junieh, a Phalangist-controlled port just north of Beirut. Israeli officials said they suspected the ferries were being used by the Phalangists to take Palestinian guerrillas into Lebanon. **********Moreover, several Israeli experts on Lebanon are advising the Defense Ministry to consider temporarily blockading the Junieh port, or even severing Israel's longstanding ties with the Maronite Christians, in hope of creating better relations with the Lebanese Shiites. **********''Everyone knows how to switch sides in Lebanon but Israel,'' said Yosef Olmert, a Lebanon expert at Tel Aviv University. ''The Syrians went from supporting the Christians to the P.L.O. and back to the Christians. The Maronites were with the Syrians, then against them, then for them. Amal was with the P.L.O., now it's against it. Even the Hezbollah militia moves around. Only Israel does not understand the rules of the game.'' 'We Are Being Used' **********''Israel is always worried about undermining the Christians,'' Mr. Olmert went on, ''because they could be helpful in the future, particularly against the Syrians. The fact is, we are being taken for granted. We are being used. We have got to demonstrate to the Phalangists what we can do to them.'' **********The Phalangists have been cooperating with Mr. Arafat's guerrillas in several fields. According to Israeli military officials, the Phalangists, apparently with the support of the Lebanese President, Amin Gemayel, a Christian, have been selling Lebanese identity papers and passports to Palestinians to help get them through roadblocks. **********Millions of dollars have changed hands, according to Israeli officials. **********The Phalangists have also been providing the Palestinian guerrillas, along with weapons, a route into Lebanon from Cyprus via the port at Junieh. The P.L.O. cannot use the regular Beirut harbor and the airport because they are controlled by anti-P.L.O. Shiite Moslems. Smuggled Across Green Line **********From Junieh, the Phalangists are reportedly smuggling P.L.O. fighters across the Green Line, which divides Christian East Beirut from the Moslem West. Once across the Green Line, the Palestinian guerrillas can then join up with thier compatriots in the West Beirut refugee districts and in southern Lebanon, where they are fighting daily battles with Shiite militias. **********Israeli officials say the number of Palestinian guerrillas involved in these transfers are in the hundreds. Their importance is that they are all pro-Arafat officers and organizers who can lead the Palestinian manpower already in the refugee districts. **********Since Israel uprooted Mr. Arafat's guerrillas in 1982, the Shiites and the Syrians have been trying to keep the Palestinians out of the country and to assert their own unrivaled authority in West Beirut and southern Lebanon instead. **********By strengthening the P.L.O. fighters in Lebanon, the Phalangists apparently believe they are prolonging the street fighting between the Palestinians and the Shiites and between the Palestinians and the Syrians, Israeli military officials said. **********Prof. Clinton Bailey, an expert on Lebanon at Tel Aviv University, said the Shiites, backed by the Syrians and other Lebanese Moslems, ''have been putting heavy pressure on the Phalagists to change the Constitution and give the Moslems of Lebanon a greater share of legal power.'' 'A Natural Counterbalance' **********''Arafat is a natural counterbalance to this pressure,'' Professor Bailey said. ''So long as the Shiites and Syrians are preoccupied fighting with the Palestinians, no one can really mount an effective challenge to the Christians' predominant position in the Lebanese structure.'' **********The Christians' relationship with the P.L.O. also gives the Phalangists some important bargaining chips for the future. Israeli officials say the Phalangists can now offer to ''sell out'' the Palestinians in return for concessions from the Shiites and the Syrians. **********Only Tuesday, President Gemayel sent a delegation to Damascus seeking a meeting with Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad, who has been putting pressure on Mr. Gemayel to agree to constitutional changes that would grant more power to the Moslems. **********Professor Bailey said: ''I can now imagine Gemayel saying to Assad: 'Look, I have these new friends, the Palestinians. I can now hold out a lot longer than you think. Maybe you should meet me halfway.' '' **********Although the return of Palestinian guerrillas to southern Lebanon may not be perceived as an immediate threat by some of the Phalangists, for Israel it is. **********Today, the Palestinian guerrillas returing to southern Lebanon may be fighting the Shiites, Israeli military officials say, but tomorrow, or in six months, after another shift in Lebanese alliances, they could be involved in action against Israel. **********''We have to take it seriously,'' said Zeev Schiff, the military editor of the daily Haaretz.

''We don't think any of these people need to be convinced that the Sandinistas cannot be trusted,'' a State Department official said. **********But even as Administration officials repeated their wariness that the plan adopted by Central American leaders might help the Soviet-backed Sandinistas, there were signs today that the plan had also caused problems for the Nicaraguan Government. A Call to Costa Rica **********Diplomats said President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua recently telephoned President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, the principal architect of the peace proposal, to explain why he traveled to Havana immediately after the accord was signed in Guatemala on Aug. 7. The diplomats said Mr. Ortega had complained that he had to get Fidel Castro's approval to ward off pressures from hard-liners in his own Government. **********''He said his purpose was to strengthen his internal position,'' an official knowledgeable about the events said. According to one diplomat, Mr. Ortega said he was principally concerned about challenges from Tomas Borge, Nicaragua's Interior Minister, who controls the country's internal security and intelligence organs. Abrams Leads Discussion **********Mr. Ortega was also seeking Mr. Castro's agreement to withdraw Cuban forces from Nicaragua to comply with the accord's provisions that all foreign forces eventually be withdrawn from the region, the official said. After the Ortega-Castro meeting, a communique was issued in which Cuba expressed its support for the Guatemala plan. **********The discussion by United States officials in Washington today was led by Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. More than 30 officials analyzed the regional accord in detail. Mr. Abrams has described the accord as ''more a preliminary agreement than a final peace treaty'' and has cautioned that it contains many ambiguities. **********The Administration, which had earlier offered its own peace plan for the region, has been forced to confront instead the accord that was signed in Guatemala City by Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador. A U.S. Campaign **********As part of its response, the Administration is trying an intense diplomatic effort to assess the accord and to shape it to its liking. The envoys are to return to their postings Tuesday to relay the American concerns before the Foreign Ministers of the five countries confer the next day in San Salvador. **********The accord signed in Guatemala is designed to resolve conflicts throughout Central America but is mainly focused on Nicaragua. It calls for scheduled cease-fires, an end to outside aid for rebel groups, the establishment of national commmissions to reconcile political differences, amnesties and movement toward full democratic rights. **********It is generally regarded as more favorable to the Sandinistas than the plan put forward this month by the Administration and Representative Jim Wright of Texas, the Speaker of the House. That plan calls for an end of military aid to Nicaragua as well as an end to military aid for the Nicaraguan rebels, and would seek an immediate suspension of emergency law in Nicaragua along with an immediate cease-fire. It envisions negotiations to restore full civil rights and elections in Nicaragua. Congress would be asked to resume aid to the rebels if there was no agreement on negotiations by Sept. 30. #1973 Accord Cited An Administration official said today that those attending the State Department meeting were given copies of the 1973 agreement negotiated between Washington and Hanoi and signed in Paris to end the Vietnam War. That agreement was used, the official said, as a case study of how an agreement with ambiguous provisions could be exploited and even ignored by a Communist government. In violation of the 1973 accord, North Vietnam overran South Vietnam and united the two parts of Vietnam under its banner in 1975. **********In connection with its stepped-up diplomatic effort to play a role in the shaping of any peace accord, the Administration hopes to have ambassadors in all five of the countries by early next month. The United States is now represented by ambassadors only in El Salvador and Honduras and by diplomats of lesser rank in Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Guatemala. **********Those attending the meeting today included Edwin G. Corr, Ambassador to El Salvador; Everett E. Briggs, Ambassador to Honduras; Todd Stewart, charge d'affaires in Costa Rica; John Moddernor, the charge in Nicaragua, and Jerry Lamberty, the charge in Guatemala. Deane R. Hinton and James Michael, the State Department's choices to be the Ambassadors to Costa Rica and Guatemala, also attended. The Administration has not signaled its choice for ambassador to Nicaragua to succeed Harry E. Bergold Jr., who was reassigned this summer. **********The envoys to each of the five countries discussed how the Guatemalan proposal would affect that country and how that Government viewed the proposal. Security Interests an Issue **********The meeting also focused on what senior officials have said are United States security interests in the region involving the Soviet Union. Earlier, one official was emphatic that Washington would not tolerate the introduction by Moscow of jet fighters into Nicaragua. ''That is a U.S.-Soviet issue,'' the official said. The Guatemala accord does not deal with that issue and officials have cited this as a major ambiguity. **********As the envoys gathered in Washington, the Administration renewed its denunciation of the Nicaraguan Government for breaking up protests over the weekend in Managua. **********''The suppression of these demonstrations and the arrests of these political leaders call into serious question the Sandinista Government's willingness to fulfill the commitments made by President Ortega to democratize Nicaragua,'' a State Department spokeswoman, Phyllis Oakley, said. **********''The arrests of these political and human rights leaders and the brutal manner and great speed with which the marches were suppressed, would seem to indicate that the Nicaraguan Government wishes to intimidate and oppress the opposition rather than fulfill its promises for democratization under the Guatemala agreement,'' she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/29/business/kodak-fuji-rivalry-over-business-takes-an-academic-turn.html": {"writer_name": "Lee Daniels", "pub_date": "1987-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 919, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kodak-Fuji Rivalry Over Business Takes An Academic Turn", "print_headline": "Kodak-Fuji Rivalry Over Business Takes An Academic Turn", "body_text": " **********Like many American corporate giants, the Eastman Kodak Company battles its Japanese competitors in whatever marketplace they meet.

It apparently became alarmed when it learned of the admission of the Fuji employee, especially because of his work in the company's new products division. **********The Simon program is relatively small, with only 300 students, and Kodak executives were worried that, in the normal give-and-take of classroom discussion, Fuji would have indirect access to some of Kodak's most sensitive information. **********In a statement issued yesterday, Kodak said it had acted out of concern that its managers ''would feel inhibited in discussions and-or reviewing case studies for fear of revealing proprietary information.'' **********But it maintained it did not threaten or force the business school officials to reconsider their admissions decision. **********Kodak gave $625,000 for programs at the University of Rochester last year and announced earlier this month that it would give $36,000 annually toward a program to teach business executives to take creative risks. The university, which has about 4,550 undergraduates and 2,200 graduate students, received a large portion of its endowment from George Eastman, Kodak's founder. In terms of endowment, it is one of the nation's 10 richest universities. **********For its part, the Simon School helped to place Mr. Sakai in another widely known business school - the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. - before rescinding his enrollment. **********The Simon School said it acted not only because Kodak was concerned but because it was worried ''about a possible constraint Mr. Sakai's presence might produce on the free exchange of information in the classroom.'' **********The school's official statement, read over the telephone by a spokeswoman, said that Mr. Sakai's background in product development ''produced an isolated incident in the history of the Simon School'' that, the statement said, ''in no way reflects any policy in place.'' **********Experts knowledgeable about American graduate business education and about the sharp competition between Japan and the United States businesses said that they knew of no other incident in which an American corporation had influenced a business school not to admit a foreign national. **********One prominent economist said he worried that publicity about the incident could create further ill will and be particularly controversial in Japan, where there is a keen sensitivity about being the target of what is seen as chauvinistic American criticism. **********Edward Lincoln, a research associate and expert on Japan at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said, ''It's certainly true that American businesses have been disturbed by the large number of Japanese nationals in American business schools and American scientific-research programs.'' **********''But,'' he added, ''I think there's a zero chance that any good business school would tailor its admissions policies to suit them.'' **********Officials of Fuji could not be reached for comment at the company's headquarters in Tokyo. A spokesman for the leaders of the company's United States subsidiary said that they did not know about the situation because Mr. Sakai was an employee of the parent company. **********One specialist on Japan said that although Kodak's apparent role was unusual, Fuji's decision to sponsor an employee like Mr. Sakai for a school so intimately connected with its primary rival has to be regarded skeptically as well. **********Russell Palmer, dean of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said: **********''I don't see how a business school such as ours could get into trying to sort out all the potential conflicts that can arise in a business school student body. **********''We have people here, too, from American companies that are competing against each other. Everybody who comes here has free access to information. Our job is to disseminate information and spur learning, and hopefully, creativity.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/03/business/business-digest-wednesday-june-3-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 713, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: WEDNESDAY, JUNE 3, 1987", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: WEDNESDAY, JUNE 3, 1987", "body_text": " **********A Shift at the Fed **********Paul A.

Less than two years after spending $100 million to acquire the once-troubled Bowery, the owners will double their money by selling the savings institution to H.F. Ahmanson & Company of Los Angeles for $200 million. **********But the sweet payoff, announced Monday, has put the original transaction, in which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ceded ownership to the investors, in a new light. A number of banking experts are wondering whether the F.D.I.C. gave away too much and whether it should have cut the investors in at all. **********''Why couldn't the F.D.I.C. have bought the Bowery, rehabilitated it and sold it itself at a profit?'' asks George G.C. Parker, a professor of banking at Stanford Business School. **********''What the F.D.I.C. said was, 'We'll take over all the garbage, we'll give you the good stuff, and you get all the profit,''' said Paul Nadler, a professor of banking at Rutgers University in Newark. ''It was an absolute rape of the public.'' **********In exchange for agreeing to take over the Bowery in the autumn of 1985, the bank's current owners requested and won nearly $275 million in cash assistance and guarantees from the F.D.I.C. The guarantees, worth $115 million, involved the assumption of certain problem loans and the indemnification of a certain amount of losses on better-quality loans left with the bank. **********The guarantees and the $160 million cash contribution made the F.D.I.C.'s commitment nearly triple that of the investor group. Even so, the insurer will not share in the sales proceeds. The Bowery owners who will profit include Richard Ravitch, former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; Laurence A. Tisch, chairman and chief executive of CBS Inc., and Warren Buffett, the Nebraska financier. **********For years, the F.D.I.C. has maintained that when it bails out an institution like the Bowery, no public money is used. L. William Seidman, the F.D.I.C.'s chairman, repeated that point in an interview yesterday. ''The money that is involved is the result of the banks' paying premiums to the F.D.I.C.,'' Mr. Seidman said. ''There is no tax money involved.'' **********But increasingly, bank experts outside the F.D.I.C. are taking a broader view. At the Wall Street firm of Ryan, Beck & Company, for instance, Michael Horn, a savings institution specialist, agreed that the F.D.I.C.'s rescue funds come from insurance premiums. But those premiums, Mr. Horn noted, are an operating expense that affect what banks charge consumers and businesses for loans. Professor Parker, meanwhile, argued that the public does have an interest in how the F.D.I.C. negotiates bailouts in light of what he called the implicit Government backing of the insurance corporation. **********In any case, the F.D.I.C. said it had no alternative but to shape the deal with Mr. Ravitch the way it did. ''We shopped the Bowery for three years; no one wanted it,'' said William M. Isaac, former head of the agency. And H. Rodgin Cohen, the Sullivan & Cromwell attorney who represented the Bowery, said the F.D.I.C. would have been in an even worse position had it rejected the Ravitch group. **********''The profit the F.D.I.C. made was the avoidance of losses it would have incurred if it had to give the bank to someone else, who would have asked for even more assistance,'' Mr. Cohen said. **********Of course, the case of the Bowery was not the first time the F.D.I.C. had poured millions of dollars into a troubled institution to keep it afloat. And, significantly, the F.D.I.C. has driven a harder bargain in the past. In the collapses of First Pennsylvania, Continental Illinois, Bank Oklahoma and, most recently, the First City Bancorporation, for instance, the F.D.I.C. made sure it would be compensated for its contributions by receiving either warrants or stock in the troubled bank. **********It is becoming increasingly clear, banking experts say, that the F.D.I.C. does have alternatives to selling out to private bidders. One is simply to liquidate the institution, a choice that, in the Bowery's case, might have produced no greater losses for the F.D.I.C. than the route it took. The F.D.I.C. could also run a troubled institution itself, a route that will become increasingly viable under new laws regarding regulators' powers. **********For now, though, the F.D.I.C. seems intent on resorting to private-sector ownership as often as possible. **********While the F.D.I.C. has a fiduciary duty to the banks that pay its insurance premiums to strike the best deal possible, it risks alienating prospective buyers if it demands too much.

By most estimates, more than a quarter-million Salvadorans, refugees of that country's civil war but also of its poverty, live in the metropolitan area.

Others enter with the help of the American church-based sanctuary movement, which has vowed to defy the Reagan Administration's position that most Salvadorans who have entered the United States have done so for economic reasons and therefore are not political refugees. **********Demographers and Central America specialists say the tide of Salvadorans coming to this country has swelled in the last five or six years. According to the Urban Institute in Washington, which made estimates for the Department of Health and Human Services, there are between 500,000 and 850,000 Salvadorans in the United States. **********Los Angeles ranks first among cities with between 250,000 and 350,000; Washington is second with 80,000 to 150,000, followed by New York and San Francisco, each of which has 60,000 to 100,000. The institute's estimates were derived from interviews with social service agencies in those cities. **********A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Duke Austin, said that the agency did not know what proportion of all Salvadorans in this country were illegal aliens, but that it estimated that half a million Salvadorans were here illegally. Amnesty for Some **********Recent changes in American immigration policy provide an amnesty for illegal immigrants who arrived before Jan. 1, 1982, thus excluding the Romeros and many, if not most, Salvadorans here. Many are reluctantly making plans to return. The Romeros said they would remain and try to gain political asylum or some other legal status. **********''We all are worried about what might happen because the situation in El Salvador remains the same, if not worsened,'' Mr. Romero said. **********The Romeros live near downtown Los Angeles in the Pico-Union district, an area dotted with Salvadoran restaurants and travel agencies and home to the largest concentration of Salvadorans in California. **********Mr. Romero, a 35-year-old janitor at a suburban condominium, first came to the United States in 1981 on a temporary visa to obtain medical treatment for a wound in Miami. He said he had been ''shot by members of the National Army in El Salvador'' while he was photographing Government human-rights abuses for a human-rights agency of the Roman Catholic Church. He returned briefly to El Salvador, then came to Los Angeles in 1982. 'I Couldn't Work' **********The visa that Mr. Romero obtained from the United States Consulate in San Salvador was only for himself, not his family. ''The consulate said if they got visas, too, we would all stay here and not return,'' Mr. Romero said. ''That is what I wanted to do,'' he admitted. ''I couldn't work in El Salvador without being persecuted'' for his human-rights activities. **********He had heard that California had job opportunities and that ''the area we could live in without any barriers of language was Los Angeles.'' He also knew his best hopes of reuniting with his family depended on their crossing over through Mexico. **********The smuggler, known to them as Julio, separated Mrs. Romero and her daughters at Tijuana, sending the mother with a companion on a dangerous hike through the border mountains, while Anna, then 7, and Marta, then 4, were supplied with false American birth certificates and driven through the Border Patrol checkpoint. **********Today the Romeros have a third child, Arnulfo, 4, born in this city. Mrs. Romero, 33, works at a Chinese restaurant. Though they are living with relatives here - 10 people in a one-bedroom apartment - they regularly send money to family in El Salvador. ''We have a roof and food, but our people in El Salvador do not have security,'' Mr. Romero said. Brutal Repressions **********Eduardo Canjura and his wife, Maria, came to Los Angeles only two years ago. Mr. Canjura, a 44-year-old bricklayer, said he was driven from his small village by lack of work, but arrived in San Salvador in 1980 to find brutal repressions. ''Someone, I don't know who, put the finger on me, said I was a subversive,'' Mr. Canjura said. **********What followed was a months-long nightmare of imprisonment and torture at the hands of the army, he said. After he gained release in a general amnesty, an American sanctuary group heard of his story and helped spirit him out of the country with a Mexican visa. **********Eventually the family was reunited here. Mr. Canjura works at odd jobs found by Caracen, a Central American relief agency, and Mrs. Canjura has joined the legion of illegal domestic workers in Southern California households. They live happily, they said, in Santa Monica in an apartment building that is slightly run down, but just steps from the same ocean beach where other Californians live the good life. **********''There are many good people who help us a lot, and we are like little ants just trying to get by,'' Mrs. Canjura recently told a visitor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/07/business/italy-host-for-the-economic-summit-a-land-of-family-businesses.html": {"writer_name": "Mary Suro", "pub_date": "1987-06-07", "snippet": "LEAD: LONG ago Adele Fendi told her daughters:", "word_count": 867, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ITALY: HOST FOR THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT - A LAND OF FAMILY BUSINESSES;\nInside the House of Fendi", "print_headline": "ITALY: HOST FOR THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT - A LAND OF FAMILY BUSINESSES;\nInside the House of Fendi", "body_text": " **********LEAD: LONG ago Adele Fendi told her daughters: **********LONG ago Adele Fendi told her daughters: **********''You girls are like five fingers on a hand; you only work well when you're together.'' Over the years, Paola, Anna, Franca, Carla and Alda Fendi used that advice to build an empire of furs, leather designs and ready-to-wear clothing into one of the most exclusive fashion enterprises in the world. ''Le sorelle Fendi,'' who range in age from 46 to 56, have been making fashion history for the last 20 years. **********Since 1965, when they began their collaboration with the Paris-based designer Karl Lagerfeld, who also designs their ready-to-wear clothing, they have changed the way wealthy, stylish women wear fur. **********They have dyed their furs rich, unheard-of colors like purple, emerald green and apricot. They rejuvenated the matronly mink coat and promoted such lesser-known skins as weasel, ferret and squirrel. They braided pelts and mixed them up; sable with opossum, fox with rabbit, mink with mole. Using new techniques, they quilted and crocheted furs, patterning them in designs inspired by Impressionist paintings and Eskimo prints. They also revolutionized the feel of fur coats, making them so light that they could be folded into an overnight bag. These moves gave Fendi a reputation as the most innovative furrier in the world. **********So exclusive is the Fendi label that a three-quarter-length honey-colored Russian sable coat in the 1987 collection will retail in the United States for about $200,000. A respected Roman furrier, who preferred not to be indentified ''out of respect'' for the sisters, claimed that she could sell a similar coat for about $110,000. **********''The Fendis and I buy our pelts at the same auctions so we pay about the same price for materials,'' the competitor said. ''The Fendis, however, can charge about twice as much because of their name.'' **********The Fendis also helped take the stiffness out of the old-fashioned sturdy leather bag. While shops like Gucci were concentrating on making traditional designs, the Fendis were coming out with purses that were soft, pliable and roomy. Their distinctly untraditional collections featured bags that were woven and meshed in bright, alternating colors, others that combined unlikely materials such as ribbed rubber with sumptuous calfskin. Leather bags with the double-F logo are selling in the $200-$400 price range at Bloomingdale's stores in New York. **********Their most recent success has been Fendi perfume, which costs $160 an ounce (eau de toilette is priced at $32 for a 1.7 ounce bottle) and was introduced in 15 Bloomingdale's stores this year. According to Joseph F. Ronchetti, president of Elizabeth Arden, the perfume's distributor, Fendi fragrance had sales of $1 million in its first five weeks on the shelves, which he called a record for new perfume promotions. **********With 100 Fendi boutiques worldwide and collections in 500 department stores producing sales of $170 million last year, up 20 percent from 1985, the sisters still defer all plaudits to ''Mamma,'' who died in 1978. It was she, they say, who instilled in them the esprit de corps that is the foundation of their business. ''We're used to being together; we've had a lifetime of playing together, amusing ourselves together,'' said Carla. ''Working together now is a joy.'' **********THE women were born and raised in the business. In 1925, Adele Fendi and her husband, Edoardo, opened a small boutique and workshop in Rome specializing in quality leather goods and fur designs in ''poor pelts'' like squirrel and Persian lamb. Their craftsmanship and unique designs earned them a following and as their business grew, so did their family. Each daughter entered the trade buried deep in the folds of a lace-lined bassinet, which had become a fixture at the shop. **********Early on, the girls learned the meaning of family unity. If one did something wrong, all were punished. Yet over the years, they developed specialties: Paola, the company president, is the expert in furs. Anna is the creative one. Franca manages leather designs and directs boutiques in Rome. Carla handles public relations and advertising. Alda works closely with Mr. Lagerfeld on fur styling. **********The five, who together own the company, meet at least once a week to review all activities. Contested decisions are always made on a majority-rules basis, with each sister having an equal vote. ''There is never a question of egos or who's in command,'' said Mr. Ronchetti. ''They function absolutely professionally as a team. There are no prima donnas.'' Arguments occur, of course, especially during creative sessions. But Carla insists there are no rivalries or jockeying for position. Instead, she says, the only objective is to to maintain a successful family enterprise. **********This sentiment, it seems, has permeated the roots of the family tree.

'The Worst Is Behind Us' **********''I think we're getting clear evidence that the worst is behind us,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. **********But the analysts and the Commerce Department cautioned that the figures remain highly volatile and noted that the overall trade deficit in dollar terms was no lower than the average for January and February. **********At the White House, Marlin Fitzwater, the Administration spokesman, called the decline in March ''good news'' and said the trade data ''indicate that the nominal trade deficit is gradually declining.'' Nominal refers to the dollar value of goods as opposed to the volume of goods as measured by unit counts. **********On Capitol Hill, where Democrats control both chambers, the reaction was considerably less upbeat. The House Speaker, Jim Wright of Texas, said that the news was chilling and that it underscored the need for rapid action to pass comprehensive trade legislation. ''Treading water is not making the shoreline,'' Mr. Wright said. A Peak in Late 1986 **********Nearly all private economists agree that in terms of volume the trade deficit peaked during the second half of 1986 and has fallen since then by about 20 percent. The current debate centers on whether the dollar-denominated deficit - the one reported today - has also turned down. **********Mr. Sullivan thinks it has, even though he observed that March is usually a strong month for exports. But Walter M. Cadette, a vice president at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said today's report did little to prove such assertions. **********''Things look very much the same as before,'' Mr. Cadette said. ''There seems to be a gradual improvement in volume terms, but you're getting an offsetting deterioration in the terms of trade, which is a fancy way of saying the price of imports is going up.'' **********The dollar's sharp fall against the yen and most European currencies in the last two years has made American exports more readily marketable abroad while making foreign goods more expensive here. This, given enough time, inevitably causes the trade deficit to shrink. **********But the adjustment is rarely smooth or its timing predictable. The J-Curve **********One important reason is that, in a phenomenon described by an economic principle called the J-curve, the short-term effect of the dollar's decline is a rise in the reported deficit, not a decline. This happens because the higher total price of imports tends, for many months, to overwhelm the reductions in volume. **********Eventually, when order pipelines must be refilled and consumers may have changed their spending patterns, the J-curve effects wear off. Analysts said today that with the yen having fallen from about 150 in March to about 140 today, the United States will be even more competitive in the months ahead, even though the Commerce Department's figures may not clearly reflect this. **********The financial markets registered no strong reactions to the trade-deficit report, although the consensus seemed to be that the numbers had fallen a bit short of expectations. Vague disappointment about the trade report was cited as the dollar fell worldwide and bond prices were modestly lower. It was also one of several factors cited for the mixed day in the stock market, which ended with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 4.19 points, to 2,325.49. Exports Highest Since March '81 **********Exports rose to $21.1 billion in March, 20.6 percent above the January-February average and the highest level since March 1981. Manufactured goods accounted for 81 percent of the increase. **********Imports, rising to a record $34.7 billion, climbed only about half as fast as exports - 11.2 percent from the January-February average. Manufactured goods accounted for 80 percent of the gain. **********The American trade deficit with Japan eased a modest $118 million from February to March, with the bulk of the gain accounted for by higher exports. Trade with Japan accounted for 36 percent of the overall American deficit. **********The deficit with Canada improved by $424 million, entirely reflecting higher exports. The department also said it had undercounted exports to Canada by about 20 percent last year. It said that it was considering ways to make its figures more accurate and that one possibility was to use Canadian import data instead of American export documents. Expanded Gap with Europe **********But the trade deficit with Western Europe expanded during March to $2.5 billion, from $1.9 billion. The deterioration against West Germany alone was $547 million, to $1.6 billion. **********The trade imbalance in manufactured goods narrowed by 7.1 percent, to $11.7 billion, while the nation's bill for imported crude oil and petroleum products eased slightly, to $3.2 billion. The agricultural surplus shrank to $193 millon, from $279 million, as imports grew faster than exports. **********Jerry J. Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, called today's trade figures ''quite good, better than at first sight.'' **********He said the numbers, combined with information from constituents, ''show we're having some success'' in raising export levels, which according to most analysts is the key to redressing the trade imbalance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/08/world/shultz-confirms-funds-from-brunei-vanished.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 205, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shultz Confirms Funds From Brunei Vanished", "print_headline": "Shultz Confirms Funds From Brunei Vanished", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State George P.

A Senate intelligence committee report last week said that such accounts were used to funnel profits from arms sales to Iran to the contras. The report indicated that Mr. Calero may have controlled three of the accounts himself. **********Millions of dollars placed in those bank accounts are missing. Senate Report Disputed **********Mr. Calero said he never thanked Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the former National Security Council aide, for any diversion of funds from Iran to those accounts. The Senate report said contra leaders had been ''appreciative.'' But Mr. Calero said, ''I can't have expressed appreciation for money we haven't received.'' **********Disputing another assertion in the Senate report, Mr. Calero said, ''Mr. North never told me that we would get funds from Iran, from Israel or from any other place.'' **********Asked about reports that Arturo Cruz, a key civilian contra leader, intended to resign from the United Nicaraguan Opposition, the rebel coalition, Mr. Calero said he would not comment ''until I hear Arturo Cruz speak himself.'' The resignation threat stems from intense infighting within the coalition, which Mr. Cruz reportedly contends is unfairly dominated by the leaders of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the rebel army headed by Mr. Calero. Some Equipment Is Denied **********Contra leaders have been unhappy since the C.I.A. resumed supplying the rebels with military equipment last fall because they believe the agency has parceled out the equipment too slowly, according to Administration officials familiar with the program. **********The agency has refused to give the contras much heavy or sophisticated equipment, such as trucks and surface-to-air missiles. One reason is that Congress has an opportunity later this month to rescind $40 million of the $100 million in aid approved last year. That is not likely to happen, most Administration officials contend. But if that aid is rescinded, the agency has concluded, the contras probably could not maintain or make good use of the equipment. **********Mr. Calero said that the rebels had been given some surface-to-air missiles since the resupply operation began, but that more were needed. He said his troops also needed machine guns, mortars, grenade launchers, light antitank weapons, rifles and ammunition. More cargo planes and helicopters for medical evacuation and transport were needed as well, he said. **********Despite that, Mr. Calero said that 6,000 rebel troops had penetrated deep inside Nicaragua and had encountered only minimal reistance from the far larger Sandinista army. In December, American officials said almost none of the contra troops were inside Nicaragua because the Sandinista army had effectively blocked them from crossing the Honduran border. Now, Mr. Calero asserted, his forces are facing ''only random resistance from the Sandinista forces, and only 300 men have been forced back to the border.'' **********Members of Congress and others have said the contras will have to make significant military gains if they expect to get any more American aid. **********Despite the reports about the diversion of profits from arms sales to Iran to the contras, and the supply of tens of millions of dollars by Saudi Arabia and other countries, Mr. Calero said the contras got only $1 million last year in addition to the $27 million for nonlethal supplies given by the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/06/world/china-says-it-downed-a-vietnamese-fighter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Says It Downed A Vietnamese Fighter", "print_headline": "China Says It Downed A Vietnamese Fighter", "body_text": " **********China said today that its Air Force shot down a Vietnamese jet fighter this afternoon after it twice intruded into Chinese air space. **********The official New China News Agency said the Vietnamese MIG-21 had intruded nearly 20 miles over southern China.

His older brother, Abbas, was detained on Jan. 26 and led the authorities to a bigger cache of methyl nitrate on the French frontier. **********In an apparent retaliation for the arrests, gunmen in Beirut seized two West German business representatives, Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt.

Mr. Levesque, who was 65 years old when he died of a heart attack Sunday, was given what was widely referred to here as a state funeral, complete with honor guards, a lying-in-state, and a service in the Quebec Basilica that was accompanied by passages from Mozart's Requiem. His coffin was covered with the fleur-de-lis flag of Quebec. A private burial followed in a suburban cemetery. **********The organizer of the funeral was the Quebec provincial government, which was headed by Mr. Levesque as Premier from 1976 to 1985. But it was a small token of how much easier matters have become between French and English Canada in recent years that nobody was heard to object to the idea of a state occasion being held by Quebec, nor even to the fact that only a solitary Canadian maple leaf flag, fluttering at half-staff above a copper-green roof in the old city, was visible among the blue-and-white banners of Quebec. A Rite of Reconciliation **********In much of English-speaking Canada, accounting for nearly three-quarters of this nation of 25 million people, the funeral was seen as a rite of national reconciliation. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, abed with flu on Wednesday, flew from Ottawa to lead a contingent of federal officials who walked behind the cortege. With him was a cluster of English-speaking politicians, including the premiers of at least two provinces that aligned themselves against Mr. Levesque's goal of independence for Quebec. **********The paradoxes might have pleased Mr. Levesque, although the pomp of the ceremony probably would not. A chain-smoking former journalist and inveterate poker player who carried a pack of cards in his pocket to some of the most important political showdowns in Canada's recent history, the separatist leader was known almost as much for his impatience with the trappings of office as for his conviction that Quebec could never be ''maitre chez soi'' - master of its destiny - as long as it remained part of Canada. **********In television commentaries, in Mr. Mulroney's eulogy before leaving Ottawa, in editorials across the country, English-speaking Canada hailed Mr. Levesque, at the end, as a man who had helped bind the country together - by forcing it to face up to Quebec's differences. In this view, an accord signed this year between Mr. Mulroney and the new Quebec government of Premier Robert Bourassa, by granting Quebec constitutional status as a ''distinct society'' and by winning the province's pledge to remain part of Canada, healed wounds that have festered since French Canada came under British dominion with the fall of Quebec in 1757. **********One person who signaled that he was uneasy with this view was Mr. Levesque's great political adversary, former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who battled with the separatist leader for 20 years over the independence issue. Mr. Trudeau appeared briefly at the lying-in-state in Montreal, attracting angry words from at least one Levesque supporter. But he stayed away from the funeral, perhaps conveying anew what he has said before - that those who think that Mr. Mulroney has buried the independence issue are deluding themselves. Applause in the Streets **********Mr. Trudeau's view is that the new constitutional accord, by encouraging Quebec to assume broader powers, will give fresh life to a separatist movement that was defeated in a Quebec referendum in 1980 and further rebuffed when Mr. Levesque's Parti Quebecois was ousted from office in an election in 1985. In support of his case, Mr. Trudeau, who retired as Prime Minister in 1984, has cited the fact that prominent separatists -Mr. Levesque among them - took heart from the ''possibilities'' for enlarging Quebec's role at the expense of the national Government that opened up with the new pact. **********In the streets of Montreal and Quebec City this week, and in the scarlet-paneled chamber in the National Assembly here where Mr. Levesque's body lay beneath a mural showing the French king's officials in council in Quebec in 1663, there were voices suggesting that Mr. Trudeau could be closer to the mark than Mr. Mulroney. Amid the powerful emotion stirred by Mr. Levesque's death, crowds in both cities lined up until past midnight to view the coffin, applauded it as it was driven through the streets, and, in Montreal, broke into the singing of a Quebec nationalist anthem, ''Gens du Pays.'' **********''Rene's death has revived everything,'' said Colette Bouchard, a Quebec City music teacher who used her lunch hour today to file past the bier. Mrs. Bouchard, a woman in her 40's who worked as an election organizer for the separatist party, said she believed that Quebec's seven million people had been ''reluctant to make the big jump'' that Mr. Levesque asked of them in the 1980 referendum, but would emerge from the ''pause'' of the Bourassa period to push once again for independence. **********Similar views were expressed by others in the line, including a senior Quebec government official, a university professor and an off-duty cook. But the word that recurred more than any other in discussing Mr. Levesque was ''fierte,'' meaning pride, a commodity of special importance among people who felt for decades that they were second-class citizens in Canada. **********''You know, he believed in us, and that gives me more pride and confidence, I guess,'' said Pierre Herve, in his 20's, after watching the coffin pass slowly along the Grande Allee, in the heart of the old city. He added, ''We loved the fellow.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/21/business/company-briefs-538487.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 410, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Argyll Group P.L.C., London, said it had conditionally agreed to sell its U.S. drinks subsidiary, Barton Springs Inc., to a new company controlled by Barton's chief executive, E.M.

Have the investors in gloom and doom suddenly been converted into optimists? Hardly. Rather, the gold bugs view each record-breaking advance in stock prices as a step closer to the inevitable end of the bull market. **********When that happens, the gold bugs expect a mass flight of capital out of ''paper stores of value'' and into such tangible assets as precious metals. **********Some of this thinking has also gained adherents among institutional stock portfolio managers, who have increasingly been using gold futures as well as options on these contracts this year to hedge, or insure, against a market correction. **********Many metals market analysts say this is why gold, silver and platinum soared with the stock market in the first quarter; soured when equity prices meandered aimlessly in the second quarter, and then rebounded with the record advances of stocks during the current quarter. **********While this theory seemed to be contradicted by yesterday's drop in precious metals prices as the Dow Jones industrial average reached yet another high, brokers said the decline in gold, silver and platinum largely reflected light profit taking by managed commodity funds whose trading strategy is determined by computer. **********''Until recently, it was assumed that the stock and precious metals markets generally had to move in opposite directions,'' said Jeffrey M. Christian, whose CPM Group Ltd. serves as consultants on the precious metals markets to Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''This was never a hard and fast rule. Similarly, the fact that precious metals have tended to move in tandem with the stock market does not mean the gold bugs have had any change of heart.'' **********Rather, Mr. Christian said, this year's odd linkage between the stock and precious metals markets ''can be explained by the belief held by an increasing number of stock investors here and abroad that it may be prudent to own some gold as a hedge. This view has become more pronounced as the stock market took off into uncharted heights this year. The preferred hedging medium of the institutional portfolio managers has been options on gold futures, while the gold bugs still favor owning physical metal in the form of bullion coins or bars.'' **********Any increase in prices and activity of gold options and futures serves to bolster the physical market in bullion. Another and quite unexpected factor that supported gold in the first quarter was the sudden explosion in silver prices after seven years of decline. **********''We tend to think that silver prices followed gold and not the other way around,'' Mr. Christian said. ''Similarly, the upturn in platinum prices in recent weeks has also put a strong plank under gold prices.'' **********Aside from the gold bugs who expect a stock market debacle and the institutional portfolio managers who are simply hedging against a more modest correction, precious metals prices have also benefited from strong technical factors. **********The current upward cycle in gold began in March 1985, when the spot price fell to $282 an ounce, Mr. Christian noted. That was the metal's lowest level since the record high of $850 reached on Jan. 21, 1980. Spot gold closed at $458 yesterday, up $56 an ounce since the start of 1987. **********By comparison, spot silver, which hit a record high of $50.35, also on Jan. 21, 1980, reached a low of just under $5 last summer, traded at $5.43 at the start of this year and closed yesterday at $7.65. Platinum's record price of $1,050 an ounce was posted in early March 1980; its low since then was $250 set in March 1985. Platinum traded yesterday at $620, compared with $470 at the start of 1987. **********The strike by South African gold miners, which began last Sunday, has had only a minimal effect on the gold market so far, in part because there is no shortage of gold. The gold chain that someone will buy today may contain metal mined a few months or a few centuries ago. The strike has not interrupted the flow of gold into the market, or the rate at which the metal is absorbed by industrial users, investors and financial institutions. **********Fred R. Demler, metals analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert, also noted that the output of gold from new and old mines in North America, Australia and other regions has been rising steadily each year, while South African mine production and ore qualities have been declining. Before the strike, South Africa had been expected to produce about a third of the 1987 global mine output of 1,800 metric tons of 32,150 ounces each."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/19/business/futures-options-crude-oil-off-sharply-rallies-to-close-higher.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Crude Oil, Off Sharply, Rallies to Close Higher", "print_headline": "FUTURES/OPTIONS; Crude Oil, Off Sharply, Rallies to Close Higher", "body_text": " **********Crude oil futures took a roller-coaster ride today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, posting sharp losses early, then recovering to close higher in a late rally, traders said. **********December crude finished 24 cents higher, at $18.64 a barrel, but earlier it had been down 35 cents, at $18.05.

He added that it was another signal to Eastern's unions that if management did not get cost reductions it would dispose of more of the airline's assets. Controls Landing Slots **********Mr. Starkman said that if the shuttle was put on the block a number of airlines would be interested in it because it controls many landing slots at La Guardia Airport and at National Airport in Washington. Slots are difficult to obtain at both airports. **********In addition, the shuttle is one of Eastern's more profitable operations, ferrying thousands of passengers daily between Logan Airport in Boston and La Guardia and National with hourly flights. **********Mr. Lorenzo, who won control of Eastern last fall, is waging a bitter struggle with the carrier's unions over cost reductions and has said that Eastern's assets would be deployed elsewhere if an agreement could not be reached. **********The company announced on Wednesday that it was eliminating 3,500 jobs to cut costs.

McGillicuddy, the bank's chairman, last week told senior officials about those layoffs, about 9 percent of the work force, according to analysts and officials at other banks. Since September 1986, the bank has reduced its work force by 2,900 people. Manufacturers would not confirm the reports. **********Manufacturers is not alone in cutting staff. In September, Chemical Bank announced it would dismiss 2,000 people, roughly 10 percent of its staff. And in November, Citibank cut 1,000 jobs in New York alone. Analysts said all the banks are reacting to a shrinking loan market and intense competition from foreign banks. Impact of Charges **********Many other banks have turned to their automatic teller machines as a source of revenue. Nationwide, about a third of all banks that have such machines charge a fee for withdrawals. Deposits and requests for balances are generally not assessed a fee.  Manufacturers Hanover, in a letter to customers several weeks ago, said that a fee of 25 cents a withdrawal would be assessed if the combined average monthly balance in savings and checking accounts was less than $1,000. A customer could also avoid the charges by maintaining a combined balance of at least $2,000 in all his or her accounts, including certificates of deposit. Whether the charges will deter the bank's customers from frequent use of the machines is not yet clear. **********Executives at other banks, who asked not to be named, said they expected to soon begin charging New Yorkers 25 to 75 cents to make cash withdrawals from automatic tellers. Consumer Groups Object **********When automatic teller machines were introduced nearly a decade ago, they were hailed by bankers as a watershed technology that would lower the cost of banking and allow banks to postpone charging consumers for the rising costs of banking services. **********Consumer groups have condemned the imposition of fees on the use of the machines, noting that they discriminate against customers with lower balances. **********''We oppose it vehemently,'' said Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a Washington-based public-interest group. ''Having suckered in sufficient numbers of consumers to use these machines, the banks propose to sock people with additional costs to patronize them.'' **********Citibank, one of the first big banks in America to use automatic tellers and one of the biggest boosters of the concept, went so far as to force certain low-balance consumers to use automatic tellers. That experiment was abandoned when consumers revolted. But Citibank has charged fees all along for cash machine use by low-deposit customers. Charges at Chase **********After Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover is the third large New York City bank to charge its customers for cash withdrawals from automatic tellers. Chase Manhattan tried the idea earlier this year, then switched to a flat monthly charge of $10 for customers with low balances. **********Around the country, where similar fees have been imposed, bankers are facing growing consumer discontent. But the initial indications are that they plan to continue the charges. **********While the cost of operating the machines is a fraction of what it costs to train and pay tellers, the banks still bear operating costs. **********For example, the machines must be filled with money, operators must be hired to handle customer inquiries, and the vestibules where the machines are situated must be heated, air-conditioned and cleaned. Unprofitable Accounts **********The charges imposed reflect ''the cost of the machines and the unprofitability of the low-balance accounts,'' said Robert Hutchinson, a senior vice president at Manufacturers. **********The Marine Midland Bank and Chase Manhattan charge 75 cents a withdrawal in upstate New York when their customers withdraw money from their accounts using machines in other banks - which are tied together in several networks. Other banks, like Chemical, allow customers of low-cost checking programs to make a number of free automatic-teller withdrawals and then charge 75 cents a withdrawal. **********When pay-per-use does become standard at New York City cash machines, bankers said, it will probably be similar to fee arrangements set up in recent years for checking accounts. That is, just as customers who maintain high balances get free checking, high-balance customers will not pay for automatic tellers. **********By comparison, customers who maintain lower balances - who typically pay for checking at present - will begin paying to use the automatic teller. Withdrawals from cash machines, in short, will be treated like writing a check. Pitfalls of the NYCE System **********If the issue is just now reaching a culmination, one reason is the so-called New York Cash Exchange. Better known as the NYCE system, this network of 4,500 automatic tellers in 18 states has been a blockbuster success, allowing large New York City banks to compete more effectively against Citibank, which has its own proprietary teller-machine network. The systems allows consumers to get cash day and night at thousands of locations. **********For many banks, however, participation in NYCE has proved costly. Because the machines seem to be everywhere, many customers have begun to make smaller and more frequent withdrawals. Although the average NYCE withdrawal is $66, many customers have taken to withdrawing $20 here, $20 there in a daily regimen that bankers said had become extremely costly to them. **********Banks pay a fee of 13 cents to 19 cents whenever one of their customers withdraws money from the machines of another bank under the NYCE system. Some banks pay the fee to the bank whose machine is used, while other banks pay the fee to NYCE. **********For instance, Chemical pays Chase if a Chemical customer uses a Chase machine. But Chemical would not receive a fee if a Chase customer used a Chemical machine. The fee would go to the NYCE system. This disparity is leading many banks to consider imposing charges. **********''Customers don't care which machines they use, and for some banks it can be a hefty cost,'' said an analyst at one of the major New York City banks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/22/business/fuji-to-market-us-goods.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 191, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fuji to Market U.S. Goods", "print_headline": "Fuji to Market U.S. Goods", "body_text": " **********Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the Japanese maker of Subaru automobiles, said today that it had formed a company to sell American-made products in Japan. **********The Subaru World Trading Company will operate at first through 70 Subaru dealerships in Japan.

Meanwhile, its holdings in Britain climbed to 14 percent from 8 percent. **********''One attraction of the British market is that the political environment increasingly seems to be favoring the Conservative Party,'' said Herve van Caloen, who manages the European portion of the Scudder fund's portfolio. **********Scudder International's major holdings there include Burton Group, a retailing company, and I.C.I., the giant chemical producer, along with Rio-Tinto-Zinc, a mining company.

Japan's export-oriented industries, with their work force reductions reflected in the nation's unemployment rate, came under pressure because of the yen's sharp rise against the dollar in the last 18 months. **********Why, then, has the Japanese stock market been toppling records? ''The reason is an excess of savings over the level of investment that was channeled into the stock market,'' explained Mr. de Vismes of the Transatlantic Growth Fund. ''In effect, there was no other local alternative outlet.'' **********His fund concentrated its investments in domestic Japanese sectors, emphasizing housing, construction and merchandising companies that stood to benefit from efforts to stimulate the economy. **********In Europe, the strong currencies of West Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland are working to the advantage of Britain, according to Mr. de Vismes. His fund has added B.A.T.

The buying was particularly noticeable in financially sensitive issues like savings and loan associations, banks and insurance companies. All have suffered substantial declines in the last 10 days. **********For analysts who monitor trading by insiders for clues to investment strategies, the failure of insiders to sound a clear warning of the market selloff is troubling. **********''They completely missed it,'' said Norman G. Fosback, editor of The Insiders, a newsletter published in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Favorable readings on insider buying had led Mr. Fosback to run the headline ''Bullish -Bullish - Bullish'' in the letter of Oct. 16, the day the market suffered its first 100-point decline.A Bearish Reading **********The Vickers Weekly Insider Report, another newsletter, had found bearish readings in September, as insiders were making three sales for every purchase. It tracks only transactions of 100 or more shares on the exchanges and 500 shares or more in the over-the-counter market. More recent numbers, from the eve of the selloff, were more bullish. **********Investors watch insiders on the theory that the people closest to companies possess the best information about business prospects and on average make the most informed buy and sell decisions on common stocks. **********Whether that theory needs reworking is unclear. If the break in stock prices carries no bad news for business - like the sharp corrections of October 1978 and 1979 - then insiders' apparent optimism on business fundamentals could be vindicated. But if the collapse in stock prices signals major trouble for the economy, as some economists argue, then corporate officers and directors will have been as taken by surprise as other investors were. **********Edwin A. Buck, who edits the Vickers Weekly, called the most recent figures on insider transactions ''very bullish.'' He expected the week ending today to show only about 1.5 insider sales for each purchase, a ratio that traditionally has been positive for the market.A Small Sample **********Mr. Fosback reported a ''sharp acceleration of buying'' in the week just before the collapse, though the sample of reports filed so far by insiders with the Securities and Exchange Commission is very small. By law, insiders have up to 40 days to report their trades. **********''You would have to say this is a good harbinger for the market's long-term health,'' Mr. Fosback said. ''Insiders are fundamentally, not technically, oriented. They see good bullish fundamentals.'' **********Among companies attracting surges of inside buying through late September was Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. At Harcourt, which borrowed heavily this year in a recapitalization to escape a raider, the company's chairman, William Jovanovich, bought 437,000 shares in late September at close to $10. The shares closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $3.75, down, 87 1/2 cents, near last week's low of $3.625. Two other Harcourt insiders bought a total of about 45,000 shares at about $10. **********''The insiders are telling us the economy is great,'' said Mr. Buck of the Vickers Weekly. ''They're saying that the things in the headlines - the budget deficit, a weakening dollar, the balance of payments - won't affect the economy that much.

Chief", "print_headline": "Webster Takes A Strong Hold As C.I.A. Chief", "body_text": " **********William H. Webster has moved to assert himself in his first three months as Director of Central Intelligence, tightening control over covert actions and ending a system under which some officials bypassed superiors to report directly to his predecessor, according to Reagan Administration officials. **********Since replacing William J. Casey, who died May 6, Mr. Webster has set up a committee of senior agency officials to review proposed covert actions to make sure that all viewpoints are considered before recommendations come to him. Significantly, the panel is headed by an official outside the agency's clandestine service. **********But Mr. Webster has not yet made any startling personnel changes at the C.I.A., and officials there are still anxiously studying his every move for clues to the direction he plans to set. 'Making Some Subtle Changes' **********According to knowledgeable officials, Mr. Webster, who was formerly Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, wants to continue in his new job after the next President takes office 16 months from now. That gives him, as a Presidential appointee, a relatively short time to build a record attractive to either a Democrat or a Republican. **********''He has been quietly and deliberately making some subtle changes that do not upset the apple cart but have the effect of changing the place,'' said Robert M. Gates, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. **********Despite some urging from Capitol Hill, Mr. Webster has decided to move slowly in replacing any of the senior officials about whom questions were raised in the Congressional investigations of the Iran-contra affair. He has appointed a special counsel to review the agency's role in the affair and has said he will make no decisions until he receives a report. **********Several intelligence officials said Mr. Webster had shown his independence from the White House early on, with the development of the Persian Gulf policy. The C.I.A.'s analysts, officials said, regarded Iran's threat to respond to the American escort operation more seriously than others. Mr. Webster was a forceful advocate of his agency's position, even though it undercut Administration policy. **********''That immediately conveyed that he was going to protect the independence and integrity of his analysts' judgments,'' an intelligence official said. **********Some officials said Mr. Webster was not opposed to covert operations and that such operations, including support for the Angolan rebels, were continuing. But it is clear that Mr. Webster wants to address one criticism of the agency that emerged from the Iran-contra investigations: that covert actions were initiated without a thorough review of the consequences. **********Mr. Webster's approach, officials say, includes a more rigorous assessment before a covert action is begun and more frequent reviews of operations in progress. **********While most officials with knowledge of the C.I.A. spoke favorably of Mr. Webster's first few months, he has some critics. They point to the fact that he has already taken some time off from work, among other things. **********Some of them suggested that he was paying too much attention to the trappings of office, noting that one of his first moves was to obtain a long-range jet for the C.I.A. that could be used for trips by its senior officials. **********But, Bill Baker, director of public affairs for the C.I.A., said the agency had operational uses for the aircraft. **********As for his work record, Mr. Baker said the Director often began his day with a 7:30 breakfast and left for home late in the evening. ''Whenever you get a new guy in an organization, you get a lot of tea-leaf reading,'' he said. ''That can lead to mis-impressions.'' A Change in Supervision **********The part of the agency most deeply implicated in the Iran-contra affair was the operations directorate, supervised by Clair George. One directorate official, Alan Fiers, acknowledged that he had remained silent while others in the Administration gave Congressional testimony he knew to be misleading. Two agency officials in Central America, the Costa Rica station chief and chief of base in Honduras, have acknowledged to C.I.A. investigators that they initially lied about their ties to the Nicaraguan rebels. **********Under Mr. Casey, Mr. Fiers, chief of the agency's Central America task force, reported to the Director, bypassing several levels of managers. Under Mr. Webster, Mr. Fiers is supervised through the normal chain of command. **********Mr. Webster has said he will make no decisions about what to do with the operations directorate officials mentioned in the Iran-contra investigations until he receives recommendations from Russell J. Bruemmer, the special counsel he named to study the matter. **********Disclosures during the Iran-contra affair about the operations division have almost guaranteed that Mr. Webster will be watching it more closely, a task that may prove difficult. The F.B.I., which Mr. Webster headed for nine years, has a long history of elevating decisions to the desk of the Director. On the other hand, the C.I.A.'s directors have, in the words of a former senior agency official, found that to penetrate a culture where secrecy is deeply rooted, they needed to be ''entrepreneurial'' in finding out what was being done in their name. **********Administration officials said Mr. Webster had taken a greater personal role than did Mr. Casey in examining the intricacies of the C.I.A. operations. **********''He wants to know what's going on a day-to-day basis,'' one official said. **********Congressional and Administration officials say Mr. Webster will need to steer a narrow course. But he needs to take some decisive actions after the Iran-contra affair to win the support of the Congressional intelligence committees and avoid more sweeping restrictions proposed by lawmakers. **********And, they said, if he moves too quickly, he risks damaging morale at an agency buffetted by both the Iran-contra investigations and some well-publicized failures in recent years. **********One possible clue to his actions in the next year can be found in 1978, when he took over the F.B.I. 'He Would Not Be Stampeded' **********The bureau had been subjected to several years of bad publicity over its involvement in domestic surveillance and break-ins. Early in his tenure, Attorney General Griffin B. Bell sent Mr. Webster a list of 68 agents involved in possible wrongdoing and subject to discipline or dismissal. **********As the months went by, Mr. Webster came under increasing pressure to make a decision. ''He would not be stampeded,'' recalled Lee Colwell, a Webster aide at the time. ''He was very concerned that we deal with facts, and not stories in the newspaper.'' **********In the end, Mr. Webster announced that he would dismiss two supervisors and give letters of censure to two others. He later reversed his decision on one of the supervisors, taking into account his cooperation with Justice Department investigators. **********As for the field agents involved, Mr. Webster announced in December 1978 that it would be ''counterproductive and unfair'' to punish agents for following orders they believed were lawful."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/09/business/market-place-the-setbacks-in-retail-sector.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1987-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 819, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; The Setbacks In Retail Sector", "print_headline": "Market Place; The Setbacks In Retail Sector", "body_text": " **********THE recent flurry of takeover proposals in the retail industry has proved of fleeting interest to investors. The stocks of three target companies - Dayton Hudson, Zayre and Alexander's - rose on the takeover announcements but have lost value in the last few days. **********And some analysts are not so sure the declines are simply the result of an underlying caution about the takeover efforts. With the national retail chains reporting their September results yesterday, Monroe Greenstein, analyst for Bear, Stearns & Company, said: ''The market's attitude, besides its caution about the bids being made, is based on sluggish retail sales. September's sales weren't bad at all but if you combine them with August, they do not appear strong. This means that the current third-quarter earnings will be coming down for some of the big companies.'' **********As for the merger pitfalls, Mr. Greenstein said: ''Look at Dayton Hudson. After the Hafts raised their bid to $68 a share from $65, the market dumped on the stock, so that now it's down $10 a share.'' This seemed to show that the market did not think the Hafts could be successful. **********Mr. Greenstein said he did not think that the decline in retail stocks was the result of a general Wall Street downturn. ''Retailing stocks tend to underperform the market as a whole,'' he said. ''And when you combine that with disappointment over sales and the way such retailing highfliers as The Gap and The Limited have tumbled, you have some big declines in the retail sector.'' **********Mr. Greenstein said that the August-September sales figures show ''there is some backup of fall inventories.'' He added: ''Stores overbought on sweaters and now they've got them up to their eyeballs. But what they really want are lots more acid-wash miniskirts and jackets. No one wants all those sweaters and everyone wants the acid-wash stuff.'' **********Yet with all the skepticism over the takeovers, there is a sense among analysts that new efforts will soon be made. The Hafts are seeking a proxy fight to oust Dayton Hudson's board, which had rejected the original $65 bid and the $3-a-share increase earlier this week. The company told analysts that it wanted to remain independent and had no interest either in restructuring or recapitalizing. It now appears that two determined forces are maneuvering for new positions. **********Some of the skepticism about the merger proposals is based on the strength of the targets. ''You have to question why the Hafts think they could or should acquire a well-established company like Dayton Hudson, which has done so many things to improve its businesses,'' said Arthur B. Britten, a New York retailing management consultant. ''Most likely if the Hafts succeed, they will break up the company, which would pay for all the money and trouble it took. That would be typical these days and that's why Dayton Hudson will fight it.'' William N. Smith, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said: ''The market has been trashing the retail stocks and tarring all companies with the same brush. Some companies are doing very nicely. **********''As to Dayton Hudson, the general investors have soured on both the seriousness of the Hafts and also on their ability to finance their $68-a-share offer. Nonetheless, the Hafts seem to be more serious about acquiring Dayton Hudson than they have in the past. But the financing of the $68 bid makes it all seem pretty rich, maybe too rich.'' Dayton Hudson's stock fell $1 yesterday, to $58, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The other takeover moves, at the Zayre Corporation and Alexander's Inc., developed earlier this week. Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., a leading shopping-center developer, informed Zayre that he planned to add at least another 78,000 shares to his undisclosed kitty of Zayre common. Yesterday, Maurice Segall, Zayre's chairman and chief executive, said, ''I have neither heard from Mr. DeBartolo on the phone or received any more letters from him.'' Zayre's stock dropped $1 yesterday, to $32.50. **********As for Alexander's, the situation seems to have stabilized. Donald J. Trump, the developer, and Interstate Properties Inc., another developer, said on Wednesday that they had agreed for a year to act jointly in buying or selling the 43 percent interest in the common stock of Alexander's that they hold together. **********A few days before, when they appeared to be moving to compete with one another for the 15-store chain that holds valuable real estate, the stock rose. But with their new friendship, the stock fell for two consecutive days. It closed yesterday at $54.50, down $1.875."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/08/business/economic-scene-reconstructing-world-system.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1987-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 898, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Reconstructing World System", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Reconstructing World System", "body_text": " **********IS the current international economic and security system, the ''Pax Americana,'' still ''robust,'' as the Japanese economist, Masahiro Sakamoto, maintains, despite unstable exchange rates, huge trade imbalances, enormous world debts, sluggish growth and persistent overcapacity and unemployment? **********Or do these severe strains mean, as Paul Streeten, professor emeritus at Oxford and Boston Universities argues, that the ''Pax Americana,'' established at the end of World War II, is breaking down and needs to be replaced by a new international order? **********Mr. Streeten, who spoke this week at Harvard University, proposes some key institutions for a safer and more effective international system: *********** An international central bank capable of creating liquidity and global reserves at a pace that would be neither inflationary nor deflationary. *********** An international income tax that would be levied automatically and progressively on all countries. *********** An international body to provide information for private and public decisions on long-term investments in plant and equipment, to help prevent lurches from scarcity to excess capacity in steel, shipbuilding or other industries. *********** An international investment trust, to channel capital from rich surplus countries to the developing countries. **********Mr. Streeten thinks it is foolish, in a world desperately short of capital, to urge Japan to cut its savings, increase its consumption and invest more at home. **********Could such an organization be kept from becoming a bureaucratic monstrosity? Recognizing that ''the stupidity of an organization is proportional to the cube of the number of its members,'' Mr. Streeten suggests establishing a ''council of wise men and women'' to monitor the system. **********The greatest obstacle to establishing the sort of system that Mr. Streeten proposes would, of course, be the surrender of some national sovereignty and the transfer of sufficient power to the decision makers who would manage the system. **********As difficult as that problem is on economic and financial matters, it would be even harder in the national security area.

Part of the explanation may be America's well-established habit of leadership, its dominance in nuclear arms, its heavy scientific and technological outlays and the preference of Japan, West Germany and other countries that the United States keep its military and economic responsibilities, for the sake of their own security and that of the system as a whole. **********Part of the reason why the existing system survives may indeed be the great difficulty of constructing a system reliable enough to take its place, in the face of the continuing threat from the Soviet Union. **********However, there are ironies in America's retention or even increase in its power, despite its apparent economic weaknesses. **********America's attributes as dominant power appear unique in the history of hegemonies. In the past, as Professor Streeten noted, the dominant nation has had four attributes: an export surplus, a capital surplus, industrial dominance and great military power. But America is retaining its hegemonic power, not in spite of its loss of the first three attributes, but because it has become the biggest trade deficit country, the biggest consumer of foreign goods, the biggest net capital importer - ''the borrower of last resort.'' As enormous importer and borrower, America has become crucial to the operation of the world economy. **********But the extremely high levels of United States trade deficits and capital imports, which have sustained the Pax Americana in the 1980's, may not be able to go on much longer, as America's foreign debts rise higher and higher. The shakiness of financial markets today, in the realization of United States dependence on continued capital inflow, have caused widespread anxieties that the tremors could cause the walls of the existing system to crumble. Can the system be reconstructed? One way out would be to combine the sort of new international institutions Mr. Streeten proposes with continued American leadership that Mr. Sakamoto and other Japanese, as well as the Europeans favor, especially in the military area. **********But to keep the system stable, the United States may have to reduce its economic burdens, and that will depend on the willingness of other countries to assume a greater share of the costs - and on the outcome of arms negotiations with the Soviet Union. **********The Russians have been carrying a military burden proportionately twice as great as the United States in relation to gross national product and would also like, as Mikhail Gorbachev has made clear, to reduce its military burdens to relieve the strains on its economy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/02/world/democrats-fail-in-senate-bid-to-delay-us-escorts-in-gulf.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Democrats Fail in Senate Bid To Delay U.S. Escorts in Gulf", "print_headline": "Democrats Fail in Senate Bid To Delay U.S. Escorts in Gulf", "body_text": " **********Senate Democrats tried to win support today for a resolution seeking a delay in President Reagan's Persian Gulf escort plans, but Republicans successfully blocked the attempt. **********The nonbinding resolution would have criticized President Reagan's plan to protect 11 Kuwaiti tankers by reregistering them so they could have American captains and flags, and thus be escorted in convoys protected by the United States Navy. **********The resolution said ''the proposed reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers should be placed in abeyance'' until all diplomatic efforts had been exhausted.

Gorbachev, for a walk along it to show him the smiling face of Hungarian consumerism. **********There is no better symbol of what one of Mr. Gorbachev's predecessors, Nikita S. Khrushchev, on a similar visit to this country, called goulash Communism than this pedestrians-only shopping street in the center of the capital. Vaci Street is where a Communist Government has set out to prove that one does not have to be a capitalist to consume like one. To critical Hungarians, the proposition is a long way from valid, in quality more than in quantity, but all concede that Vaci Street puts up a good show. **********Instead of the arid pyramids of cookie boxes, stacks of the unread collected works of Lenin and the national Communist leader or rigidly aligned bolts of gloomy fabrics that fill so many shopwindows in the lands of centralized economies, Vaci Street celebrates Hungarian flair. Elegance Is the Keynote **********The facades of the business houses along the old-established street that parallels the Danube have been refurbished and their Art Nouveau curves given a lift. Such details as street lamps, telephone booths, mailboxes and manhole covers have been expensively recreated to recall a past that makes even young Hungarians nostalgic and Western tourists regret the flashy modernity of their cities. From Vorosmarty Square along four blocks to where Vaci Street meets the approaches of Elizabeth Bridge, old-style elegance is the keynote. **********Gerbeaud, the sumptuous empire-style coffeehouse on the square, has been given its old name, although ''Gerbeaud'' never lost popular currency while the dogmatism of an earlier period effaced it officially. Ageless women still meet of an afternoon for more buttercream torte and coffee submerged under whipped cream than is good for them and to sport hats that flattered them in days gone by. **********From a concert-ticket agency, the shrill sounds of Western rock fills the square, and young Hungarians crowd before its windows to demonstrate rhythmic enthusiasm. A screen vibrates with the latest video clips of a British or American pop star who is scheduled to fill a sports arena to its rafters for a concert appearance. **********The windows of Western airline offices display views of their capitals, Alps or shores that are now accessible to Hungarians. Even Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, graces Vaci Street with an elegantly styled series of windows. #4 Stories of Fashions The modern Fontana department store has four stories of mainly imported fashions of what is the bottom of the line in Austria or Italy. They draw eager shoppers here, despite prices that represent far greater shares of normal earnings than the same items would in the West. A week's wages is the average price for a pair of jeans. **********The outlet of Adidas, the West German sportswear maker, has been besieged by shoppers since it opened last month. The lines are almost as long as those where people wait in hope of a piece of sausage or cheese in the stores of neighboring Rumania. **********But Vaci Street would be much less attractive if it were not for the shops that are hardly visible from the street. Behind almost every building are courtyards full of shops ranging from tiny to small where more or less private entrepreneurs display their wares. **********Even between two of Aeroflot's windows, a sign in an entrance way invites women to Richi Modell boutique, a fashion shop of mini-size. The word ''boutique'' and similar foreign terms that private shop owners use to make their establishments seem jet-set has aroused the anger of Hungarian language purists. They want Hungarian terms or, at a minimum, spellings like ''butik.'' A Basement 'Jeans Shoope' **********This unusual bit of xenophobia in a cosmopolitan nation has not dampened the ardor of one of Vaci Street's real drawing cards, the Blue Man Super Jeans, a basement ''jeans shoope,'' as a sign proclaims. **********Fontana, a state store, also has a foreign name, said Istvan Gomori, Blue Man's manager, so why change a brand name that has become a name to be reckoned with among the young of the Communist countries? **********To the taped sounds of country and western, jeans, denim jackets and overalls, all designed by the seven-member cooperative that founded the brand and the store five years ago, sell like hot paprika. **********At the corner of the square, a young magician is playing tricks with a reluctantly disappearing pigeon, drawing more applause than coins. Two folk singers draw laughs with their lyrics and antics and better receipts than the magician in a washboard that serves as their till. **********Among the glitter, peasant women in traditional black stand out. They hawk their embroidered blouses, tablecloths, napkins and the like, as well as chess sets and other wooden wares carved by their husbands. **********The goods are known to be smuggled, but the police do not interfere. The vendors are members of the Hungarian minority from Rumania, who have slipped the work of months of long nights past Rumanian customs guards. With their earnings, they buy food, clothing and other essentials to take home to impoverished Rumania. **********Saddened as Hungarians are by the plight of their fellow countrymen, they do not seem displeased when a visitor remarks that Vaci Street illustrates differences between Hungary and its Eastern neighbors. They would be happier yet, some suggested, if Vaci Street were even more like the shopping streets of its neighbors to the West."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/04/world/china-says-it-will-stop-arms-for-iran.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1987-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 540, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Says It Will Stop Arms for Iran", "print_headline": "China Says It Will Stop Arms for Iran", "body_text": " **********China has again told the United States that Beijing will try to stop its weapons from reaching Iran, a senior American official said here today. **********The official, Michael H.

On Monday, Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang derided as ''completely groundless'' suggestions that China was shipping arms to Iran.

''There was a repetition of their intention to prevent the diversion of Chinese-origin equipment to Iran,'' he said. **********American officials have said that China sells about $1 billion worth of arms to Iran each year. Recently, however, Iran's use of Silkworm missiles in its attacks in the Persian Gulf have strained U.S.-Chinese relations and have resulted in the Administration's decision to cancel talks on increasing technology transfers to China. **********Mr. Armacost said the Silkworm ''has a range and capabilities which permitted it to be used in a way which internationalizes the conflict.'' **********''It is being directed at flagships that are engaged in peaceful commerce,'' he said. **********He would not comment on whether China was providing weapons training to Iran but said, ''It's a good question.'' **********During the visit, which ended today, Mr. Armacost met with Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian, Deputy Foreign Minister Zhu Zizhen and Deputy Prime Minister Tian Jiyun. **********Despite his expressions of concern over arms sales to Iran, the Under Secretary said that bilateral relations remained essentially sound. ''I think there are some current problems in the relationship,'' he said.

He said: My master has gone to gather herbs.  He is somewhere on this mountain,  But so thick are the clouds, I know not the place. **********''Can you read this?'' Mr. Tian asked, turning toward the 18 children seated on thick-plank benches behind wood desks. Small hands popped up, severing the shafts of sunlight that eased the dimness of the chilly classroom. In hill-country Hunan-flavored Chinese, a young girl clattered through the simple stanza. **********''Now, who can write it in Miao?'' he asked. Four pupils slowly scratched the syllables of the Miao language beneath the Chinese ideograms. A Vanishing Culture **********In this village skewered into a twist of granite hills, children of the Miao, a small ethnic nationality unrelated to China's Han majority, study the Chinese language, poetry, history and ways of life. A glancing swipe at their mother tongue is the most these children, and Miao children elsewhere in these harsh hills, will ever learn of their heritage in school. **********For here, as in other parts of China where peoples of non-Chinese heritage dwell, the distinct culture of the Miao is fast vanishing under an unstated but unmistakable policy of national homogenization. **********''The Miao, in my opinion, will die out,'' said a northern Chinese who has spent a year studying poverty here in western Hunan Province. ''It's taboo to say that, but it''s true.'' **********There are but five million Miao in China, a million of whom live in Hunan. More than 1,000 years ago, a group of Miao, known as the Meo or Hmong in Southeast Asia, migrated northward to these impenetrable hills, then covered with trees. A History of Rebellion **********Independent, fiercely resistant to control, this area of western Hunan pulsed with rebellion time and again. Kang Xi, the Qing dynasty emperor of the late 17th and early 18th century, told his sons, ''Even the Miao can be controlled through compassion.'' **********Nonetheless, Qing emperors built an impressive chain of 500 stone forts and garrisons through these mountains to contain Miao rebellions against Chinese rule. The last uprising, or at least the last one acknowledged, came in 1942 as the Miao sought to retrieve land appropriated by local Chinese. **********The isolation of the Miao here allowed their culture and oral tradition to flourish. Magic and superstition, elaborate folk tales and hill songs invigorated village life, according to contemporary accounts. **********Today, much of Miao culture here has been suppressed and displaced by the mores and habits of China's dominant ethnic Hans. An official in the minorities affairs department of Hunan's provincial government, Ma Liangsheng, offered only one example of remaining Miao culture that is still permitted. **********''They can keep their own customs,'' he said. When pressed what customs in particular, he replied: ''Their festivals. They have their own festivals, and during the festivals they have their own celebrations.'' Educating Against 'Superstition' **********During the political violence of the Cultural Revolution that ended in 1976, he said, no festivals were permitted. Now, he said, ''We oppose superstition - we educate them against it.'' **********In some ways, the Miao are freer than most Chinese from legal strictures. Miao women tend to marry starting at the age of 17, while Han women are supposed to wait until they are 20. And couples from ethnic minorities like the Miao are usually allowed to have at least two children, while Han couples are officially limited to a single child. **********But a Miao who works in the prefectural government, Wu Housheng, was blunt about the culture's demise. **********''There is nothing printed in Miao,'' he said. ''There is no Miao dictionary. The written Miao language is an experimental language. If the leadership does not give enough funds it will be difficult to popularize the language more.'' **********In Mr. Tian's schoolhouse here, as in other schools in villages throughout this prefecture, Miao is used only in the first year of primary school to help introduce the children to the spoken and written Chinese language. In all other primary and secondary education, standard Chinese, as Mandarin is now called, is the language of instruction. Traditional Costumes **********On market days, Miao women and a few men trek hours over hill paths from inaccessible villages to market towns like Shanjiang, about 10 miles northeast of here as the cormorant flies, carrying bamboo baskets. **********Most women over 30 wear the traditional deep-blue tunic with embroidered bibs and black trousers. Most also wear the syoumai, a 40- or 50-foot length of black or blue-black gauzelike material that is wrapped around a woman's head until it looks a bit like a squat barrel. Some women jangle with silver necklaces and bracelets. **********The swarms of women banter over pork prices or the quality of factory-made cloth; there are few of the consumer goods available here that are seen in less remote areas. **********''One of the biggest problems here is to shake off poverty and to make Fenghuang not so poor,'' said Ou Daiming, a deputy director of this area of 300,000 people. ''It is a poor district and we have to build up the confidence to catch up with advanced areas. According to published statistics, the average yearly income is 395 yuan.'' That is about $106. **********''But actually,'' he added, ''the annual income is about 280 yuan,'' about $75. **********The northern Chinese investigator, who did not wish to be named, offered a less sanguine view of economic progress. **********''I've talked to many officials who are very pessimistic about the future of the area,'' he said. ''They saw no future. In one village I visited, every two people have to share one quilt. And they said they have only enough food for half the year.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/26/world/chirac-his-cocleagues-split-attacks-rightist-demagogy.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Bernstein", "pub_date": "1987-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 436, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHIRAC, HIS COCLEAGUES SPLIT, ATTACKS RIGHTIST 'DEMAGOGY'", "print_headline": "CHIRAC, HIS COCLEAGUES SPLIT, ATTACKS RIGHTIST 'DEMAGOGY'", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, with his political allies deeply divided over how to deal with the growing strength of the far right National Front Party, has publicly repudiated what he called ''intolerance and sectarianism'' in France. **********In a speech to a rally of 40,000 supporters Sunday night, Mr. Chirac denounced what he called the ''demagogy of a certain political discourse,'' a clear reference to the National Front, whose increasing appeal in France has been largely based on a highly nationalistic, anti-immigration program. **********But, while trying to distance himself from the far right, which has the backing of an estimated 10 to 13 percent of the electorate, Mr. Chirac implicitly rejected calls in his own ruling Rally for the Republic Party to repudiate the National Front. **********Never mentioning the National Front by name, Mr. Chirac called for a ''union'' of the right, a phrase that was widely described among political commentators here as an effort to win back the electorate that supports the extreme right's policies.

But he obviously resents criticism and privately expresses utter contempt for civilian political leaders, from community leaders to presidential candidates. He has persistently refused to meet with them and discuss their mutual visions for Haiti. Welcomed in Interim **********Most Haitians welcomed General Namphy as interim leader. Though he had managed a successful career under the founder of the dictatorship, Francois Duvalier, and his son, Jean-Claude, General Namphy was remembered as having somehow remained independent and uncorrupted. **********For a long time, many Haitians said General Namphy was not moving swiftly toward democracy and not aggressively rooting out Duvalier loyalists from Government posts because he was boxed in by powerful figures from the old regime. **********But his staunchest supporters began to question his intentions after he tried to push aside the civilian Electoral Council and put responsibility for running the elections in the hands of the army, an organization that historians say stole the last elections in Haiti in 1957 for Francois Duvalier. He backed down after a few days of bloody protests. **********General Namphy portrays himself and the army as above reproach, and those who have been in touch with him say he was deeply offended by the distrust demonstrated in the rejection of his elections maneuver by nearly every civic and religious organization in the country. Council Kept Its Distance **********Restored to its constitutionally endowed position of supremacy over the elections, the nine-member Electoral Council distanced itself from General Namphy and his principal colleague in the Government, Maj. Gen. Williams Regala. Furthermore it began publicly criticizing them for failing to maintain order in Haiti so that fair elections could be conducted. General Namphy became enraged. He fell silent and left the council to fend off death threats and attacks on its facilities. **********The Electoral Council has been far from flawless. The council members, including several lawyers, a businessman and a clergyman, have little administrative experience. They have reportedly bickered among themselves and been reluctant to take advice from American, Canadian and French diplomats and technicians, and they have failed to develop a comprehensive elections plan. **********Some council members have been criticized for having had connections with the Duvaliers. But they seem to be earnestly trying to bring off the elections, and no one has accused them of acting unscrupulously. They deny that they intended to insult General Namphy and say they feel they have showed restraint. **********General Namphy clearly feels otherwise. Several Western diplomats say they believe that he finally began to extend some cooperation to the Electoral Council not because of international dismay or diplomatic pressure but because the council softened the tone of its messages and began rather politely asking for help rather than demanding it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/07/world/far-reaching-economic-changes-stir-in-bulgaria.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1987-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1199, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Far-Reaching Economic Changes Stir in Bulgaria", "print_headline": "Far-Reaching Economic Changes Stir in Bulgaria", "body_text": " **********Bulgaria, the Soviet Union's most orthodox disciple, has ended a period of apparent hesitation that followed the accession to power of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, and plunged into a far-reaching program of political and economic overhaul. **********If the changes in the organization of Government, the Communist Party and the economy that have been announced in often vague terms since late July are fully carried out, this country is likely to emerge as the most thoroughly revamped of the Communist-ruled nations. **********But while some administrative restructuring appears to be genuinely under way, changes in the basic institutions that run the state and economy have not yet appeared. ''Glasnost'' -the word is the same in Bulgarian and Russian - and ''democratization'' still appear to be no more than widely used catchwords without Bulgarian contents. **********In a series of interviews, senior officials dwelled on one main theme. They said Bulgaria had gone as far as it could along the lines of a traditional, centrally planned Soviet-style economy. Subjected to frequent changes since the 1960's, this system, they said, has succeeded in raising a backward, agrarian economy to one based on a mix of industry and agriculture, and has greatly improved the nation's standard of living. 'Intensive Development' Sought **********''We have no reason to be displeased with our development so far,'' said Ivan Iliev, who heads an important commission newly formed in the party's central committee to develop economic and social policies. ''But now we must transform our economy from extensive to intensive development.'' **********''Parkinson's Law is valid in any management structure,'' said Ognyan Panov, director of the Institute of Social Management, the party's leading management expert, who spent a year studying at Stanford University. ''The present management did not want to give up its power. We started in 1980 to try to give more power to the lower levels. It didn't work. We have to change totally.'' **********The changes, as outlined in a 95-page program speech by President Todor Zhivkov, the party's 76-year-old General Secretary, in a hastily called meeting of the Central Committee on July 28, will introduce ''self-management'' throughout the economy. **********The term, the specifics of which remain to be defined, means that each industrial enterprise will make its own production and sales decisions, raise its own capital through commercial banks that are to be created, elect its own management and distribute its revenues as it wishes. Indebted to Soviet Union **********All officials emphasized that central planning would continue, but acceptance of the plan by enterprises would no longer be compulsory. **********Bulgarians and diplomats expressed uncertainty on how such enterprise independence can be achieved in a country deeply indebted to the Soviet Union, which takes 60 percent of Bulgaria's exports. Another 20 percent of Bulgarian exports go to the other member countries of Comecon, the Soviet-bloc trading organization. **********''When the Government undertakes an obligation in Comecon, it must get the consent of the enterprises,'' said Atanas Paparizov, director general of the Trade Ministry and Bulgaria's negotiator in its application for admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. ''It will have to pay the difference if it obliges the enterprise to export to Comecon goods that it could have sold elsewhere.'' **********The officials stressed that economic overhaul was made necessary by rapid technological development throughout the world. They conceded that change alone cannot close the technological gap that separates East from West. Some New Competition **********''This is the most complex issue,'' said Mr. Iliev. ''For the last 20 years the gap has been increasing. We can't hide this truth, the party and state leadership knows this.'' **********''The Eastern markets are now approaching those of the West in competitiveness,'' said Mr. Paparizov. ''They want quality, not only quantity.'' **********Mr. Iliev illustrated the reasons for Bulgaria's declining growth rate, which has sunk from more than 11 percent a year in the earlier stages of industrialization to a yearly average of 3.7 percent from 1981 to 1985. **********''For example, we use as much ferrous metal, as much electricity per capita as any developed country, but our results are considerably lower. Our quality, technology and equipment are less good. Our capacity to introduce more raw materials, more manpower is exhausted. **********''Our old methods of management were good enough when we had more resources to inject. No more. We have to give up our old methods. We need new technologies, higher labor productivity and structural changes in the economy.'' Wave of Restructuring **********Mr. Iliev's new job is in itself an example of the wave of restructuring that has swept through Government and the party. Until Aug. 18, he was a Deputy Prime Minister and chairman of the State Planning Commission. **********On that day, the National Assembly abolished the positions of eight Deputy Prime Ministers, dissolved four government councils that had been acting as superministries since last year, and scrapped the State Planning Commission, three major ministries and three state committees of ministerial rank. **********At the same time, five new ministries, each combining the functions of several old ministries or equivalent bodies, were created. Administration Revamped **********Parliament also revamped the administration of this country of nine million by abolishing the basic units of regional government, 28 districts, and creating in their place 9 provinces. **********Stoyan Mihailov, the Party Secretary who heads the Central Committee's department on ideological, cultural and press policies, said the Government and party reorganization would reduce the number of party functionaries by as much as two-thirds. **********''They are not in danger of unemployment,'' Mr. Panov said. He added that training programs were being organized to prepare those displaced for other jobs. **********Mr. Iliev said he placed his hopes for improving the economy on existing joint research programs within Comecon for Bulgaria's own scientific advances and increased transfers of Western technology in selected fields. He said newly liberalized rules for joint ventures would attract such transfers. Reflectively, he added: ''The Soviet Union might transfer technology from military to civilian production. Then our dependence on Western technology will be liquidated. In the military sphere, the Soviet Union and the West are not so different.'' Some Resistance Encountered **********Official pronouncements stress that the Communist Party's monopoly on power - ''the leading role of the party,'' in the language of Communist states - would be enhanced rather than weakened. To redefine this concept under the new rules, an exceptional party conference is being prepared for December. By then, officials said, revamping of the state and economic machinery will be completed. **********However, the changes have encountered a certain amount of resistance. **********''There are managers who oppose increased self-management,'' said Mr. Mihailov, the Party Secretary. ''It gives them more responsibility. With higher centralization, there was always the excuse that the organization above was in charge.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/10/business/british-telecom-leader-retiring.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Telecom Leader Retiring", "print_headline": "British Telecom Leader Retiring", "body_text": " **********Sir George Jefferson, 66-year-old chairman of British Telecommunications P.L.C., said today that he would retire Sept. 30.

''I've had that experience before.'' **********Everywhere on Capitol Hill, from office televisions to a loudspeaker outside the caucus room, the hearing was a constant background noise. Tourists began lining up outside the Russell Senate Office Building before 9 A.M., and were rotated in, a dozen at a time, for one-hour shifts. **********''This would be like Watergate,'' said James Lindell, a high school student from Washington State, ''except that Richard Nixon didn't have a good man like Oliver North to destroy the evidence.'' **********Representative Peter W.

Col. Oliver L. North - there were lighter moments as well. **********When Mr. Nields asked Mr. Secord what the word ''Copp'' meant in a secret memo, the witness said it had been his pseudonym. **********''I chose it because it was the author's name in a book I happened to be reading at the time,'' he said. ''I didn't have time to look in the telephone book for a name. That's the normal way we do it.'' **********After he had told of many acronyms and shifting company names for operations designed to help the Nicaraguan contras, Mr. Secord was asked what he meant by the term ''CD,'' when he said that his operation would be ''wiped out'' financially except for its ''CD.'' **********''It means certificate of deposit,'' he said, causing the audience to laugh. **********Some lawmakers dealing with the less showy business of Capitol Hill were drawn to the caucus room to hear about what Senator Heflin called a tale of ''rogue elephants, Persian rug merchants, loose cannons, soldiers of fortune, privateers, profiteers, believers, hostages and contras.'' **********Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, sat in a back row among the spectators for a while, but said as he left that he had no regrets that he did not get on the Senate committee.

Consequently, the Hunts argue, the difference should no longer be considered a secured debt. Rather, the banks should become unsecured creditors on that portion of their loans for which there is no collateral. Unsecured creditors would be repaid over 10 years, the filing states. Confidence Expressed **********''We're talking about a debt plan that has a chance of being approved by the court over the objection of the banks,'' said Henry W. Simon Jr., a bankruptcy attorney for Placid, in an interview last week. Mr. Simon said that he was confident that a plan to pay creditors could be worked out ''almost immediately - with the exception of the Placid banks.'' **********However, an attorney for the First Republicbank Corporation, R. Paul Wickes, minimized the importance of today's filing and questioned whether Placid would pursue the tactic announced in the plan. **********''The threat of such a plan is absolutely run-of-the-mill,'' he said. ''Of course, we are a long way away'' from seeing whether Placid clings to such an attempt, he added. **********Placid, which is owned by the trusts of the three Hunt brothers of Dallas, filed for bankruptcy protection last August. The brothers' two largest companies, Placid and the Penrod Drilling Company, had previously filed a $13.8 billion lawsuit against 23 creditor banks, of which 18 were lenders to Placid. **********In today's filing, Placid said that the banks' interest in their collateral was currently worth less than $500 million. At the time of the bankruptcy, the collateral was worth $350 million to $400 million. The value has increased since then as oil prices have risen. $810 Million Owed Banks Still, the banks were owed $810 million, which includes interest, on the day of the bankruptcy filing. **********With only a portion of the debt covered by the collateral, the remaining balance should be treated as unsecured, Placid said. This would mean that the banks would be counted along with nearly 3,000 unsecured creditors. **********With many of them considered friendly to Placid, the reasoning goes, the banks' power to shape the reorganization plan would be diluted. Likewise, banks would not be entitled to any interest that accrued after the bankruptcy date, the filing said. **********Additionally, the plan called for the Internal Revenue Service to be paid over six years; the I.R.S. has filed a $550 million claim against Placid for back taxes.

No Junk Bonds in New Bid **********Mr. Redstone argued that his offer was better for shareholders because it included more equity and because it did not depend on the high-yield, high-risk securities that were a crucial part of the Viacom deal. Viacom's management would depend on $1 billion in such ''junk bonds'' to complete its buyout. **********After the Redstone deal, shareholders would own 20 percent of a company that had $400 million in equity, compared with a company that had only $81 million in equity under the management deal. **********Mr. Redstone also argued that, by using bank financing, he was substantially reducing the interest expenses involved in an acquisition. **********One arbitrager noted that replacing junk bonds with bank debt could make the preferred stock more valuable. Not only might it trade at a higher price because the underlying company would be better financed, but it could also prove more valuable when the convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock. Leveraged Buyout Bid Criticized **********According to Mr. Redstone's filing, the determination of Viacom's management to proceed with a leveraged buyout apparently angered him. The filing disclosed a letter to Allan R. Johnson, chairman of a special committee of Viacom's board, in which Mr. Redstone wrote that he was convinced ''Viacom and its board had engaged in a series of acts that were contrary to the interest of the company's shareholders.'' As examples, he cited a ''poison pill'' provision, ''greenmail'' and ''golden parachutes.'' **********Some sources familiar with the offer added that it was likely Mr. Redstone could complete the deal in six to eight weeks. But other industry experts said they thought the transfer of licenses could result in the deal taking significantly longer, even as much as six months. **********While the transfer of television station licenses requires Federal Communications Commission approval, Mr. Redstone indicated that he would put the stock of Viacom in a trust while the transfer of licenses was taking place."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/20/world/visit-by-alfonsin-peacefully-ends-argentine-mutiny.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1987-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1041, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VISIT BY ALFONSIN PEACEFULLY ENDS ARGENTINE MUTINY", "print_headline": "VISIT BY ALFONSIN PEACEFULLY ENDS ARGENTINE MUTINY", "body_text": " **********President Raul Alfonsin went to an army base this afternoon and persuaded rebellious officers there to surrender, ending a four-day mutiny. **********In a dramatic end to the military crisis over human-rights abuses, the President then returned by helicopter from the military base on the northern outskirts of the capital and told 200,000 wildly cheering people in the central Plaza de Mayo that the mutineers had given up and that they would be detained and submitted to justice. **********''The house is in order, and there is no bloodshed!'' he shouted from the balcony of the rose-colored presidential palace to the crowd before him and to the nation watching on television. 'Celebrate Easter in Peace' **********''The men in uprising have backed down,'' Mr. Alfonsin said. ''In line with that which has been called for, they will be detained and put to justice.'' **********He told people to ''go home and kiss your children and celebrate Easter in peace.'' **********Then he turned and began to embrace the smiling Cabinet ministers, politicians and military leaders sharing the balcony with him at the end of the crisis that began in the western city of Cordoba on Wednesday when an army major refused to appear in court to answer charges of rights abuses. Outpouring of Popular Support **********Three and a half hours earlier today, the President made the surprise announcement from the same balcony that he was going to the school to seek the surrender of the rebels. **********He told the people to wait for him, promising that ''if God wills it, and all the Argentines are with us,'' he would find a solution to the crisis. **********Mr. Alfonsin said the support that had been given to Argentine democracy by the political opposition, labor, business and other groups had demonstrated to the mutineers and the world the country's ''definitive decision to live in democracy.'' **********The President then boarded a helicopter for the short trip to the rebels' enclave - an infantry school in the Campo de Mayo military base 20 miles north of downtown Buenos Aires. Thousands of civilians were gathered outside the school, shouting anti-military slogans. The authorities repeatedly urged them to leave the area and go downtown to await the President, but people continued to arrive. **********Mr. Alfonsin said later that he had spoken with the mutiny leader, Aldo Rico, a lieutenant colonel who was dismissed from the army Friday after the infantry school takeover. No details of the discussion were announced. 'Dirty War' Amnesty Sought **********The rebels, whose number was put at somewhere between 50 and 350, took over the school to demand an amnesty for killings and other human-rights abuses committed by the armed forces during the military's ''dirty war'' campaign against leftists in the mid-1970's. The rebels, said to be mostly captains, repeatedly asserted that they continued to recognize the authority of the President and were not seeking a coup. **********The takeover near the capital came after mid-level officers in an army unit in Cordoba, 400 miles west of Buenos Aires, rebelled in support of the Maj. Ernesto Guillermo Barreiro, who refused a summons from a Federal court to be questioned about abuses committed at a detention center in Cordoba in the 1970's. **********Major Barreiro was promptly dismissed from the army, but he remained holed up in the barracks in Cordoba, protected by sympathetic comrades. On Friday, however, Major Barreiro fled the barracks, and the other rebels in Cordoba ended their action. It was not known whether they had been detained, nor was there information on the whereabouts of Major Barreiro. **********He is among about 280 military men, roughly one-third of them on active duty, who face human-rights charges in civilian courts around the country. Troops Moved Slowly **********On Friday, the army Chief of Staff, Gen. Hector Rios Erenu, declared his loyalty to the Government and said he intended to use troops to put down the rebellion in the Campo de Mayo. **********The next two days were spent in ponderous troop movements by units of the II Army Corps stationed north and west of the capital, but by this morning most of the force, estimated at 1,000 to 2,000 men, was still camped about 25 miles north of Campo de Mayo. **********Government officials implied that the delay was an effort to allow the rebels to surrender peacefully. The Government repeatedly denied that it was negotiating with the rebels. **********Comments from some members of Mr. Alfonsin's Radical Civic Union, however, indicated that there was a problem in convincing some mid-level officers to agree to attack the mutineers. Rumors of Army Changes **********Several hours after the crisis came to an end, Government officials said General Rios Erenu, 14 other generals and 30 colonels would retire or be dismissed. The sources suggested that this was the result of their hesitation or reluctance to deal with the crisis. **********At the same time, one demand of the rebels was the replacement of General Rios Erenu. They claimed he had never adequately explained their position on the human rights trials to the President. **********In addition to the demand for an amnesty for all of the military, the rebels appeared to be seeking to focus attention on the longstanding assertion within the army and navy that middle- and lower-level officers should not be punished for things they did under orders from superiors. **********When the President went to the base this afternoon officials made it clear that he was taking the matter into his own hands as Commander in Chief. The highest-ranking army officer with him was Gen. Augusto Vidal, described as holding a military training position. General Vidal, officials said, took the rebel leader, Mr. Rico, into custody. General Vidal was also rumored as the probable next army Chief of Staff. **********The air force chief, Brig. Gen. Ernesto Crespo, was also conspicuously present at the President's side during the day, and the navy made statements of support for the Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/world/far-right-south-africans-decide-to-leave-dutch-reformed-church.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 532, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Far-Right South Africans Decide To Leave Dutch Reformed Church", "print_headline": "Far-Right South Africans Decide To Leave Dutch Reformed Church", "body_text": " **********About 2,500 right-wing dissidents today walked out of a meeting discussing the liberalization of the Dutch Reformed Church, the main Afrikaner church that justified the creation of apartheid. **********At the meeting in Pretoria attended by more than 3,000 from the right wing, the dissidents voted by a margin of 4 to 1 to form a new all-white church and accused the Dutch Reformed leadership of embarking on a ''new course of liberalism'' by criticizing apartheid policies and seeking to open the church to all races. **********But 500 to 800 of the dissidents voted not to quit, electing instead to work from within to oppose the ''liberal moves.'' **********Meeting in Pretoria in Skilpad Hall, where the far-right Conservative Party was established five years ago, the dissidents added momentum to the right-wing backlash against the Government of President P. W.Botha. Impact Yet to Be Determined **********Prof. Johan Heyns, head of the Dutch Reformed Church, who has led efforts to desegregate the church, said the effect of the walkout would be determined by the number of people who followed the dissidents out of the church. **********''It is a sad event and both an act of disunity regarding the church and an act of disobedience regarding scripture,'' he said. **********Professor Heyns, who emphasized that he regarded the action as a walk-out, said the move illustrated the close link between religion and Afrikaner nationalism. ''But this is not a basis for a church,'' he added. **********Both Mr. Botha, who is an active member of the church, and Dr. Andries P. Treurnicht, leader of the Conservative Party and a former Dutch Reformed minister, were reported to be deeply concerned about the break. Appeal to Dissidents **********In a statement issued on Tuesday, Dr Treurnicht indicated sympathy with the dissidents, but appealed to them not to break with the church before exhausting other options. **********The dissidents, organized as the Continuation Committee of Dissatisfied Members and led by Prof. Willem Lubbe, have rejected recent moves by the church to unite with its black, Indian and mixed-race ''daughter churches'' and to distance itself from apartheid. **********Professor Lubbe said the new church would be called the Afrikaner Reformed Church and predicted that it would win wide support nationwide. **********A breakaway had been regarded as inevitable after the Dutch Reformed Church's general commission rejected the dissidents' objections on Tuesday. Seeds Sown by New Policy **********The breakaway from the 1.7-million-member church, which includes most members of the National Party Government, came after weeks of negotiations between Dutch Reformed leaders and the dissidents over a policy document that criticized apartheid and which was adopted at a synod last year. **********The document, which some saw as a turnabout in church policy, for the first time described apartheid as scripturally unjustifiable and racial discrimination as a sin.

But Mexico's two major opposition parties, one on the right, the other on the left, are preparing for the presidential campaign and election as if they really expect to win. **********''The country faces its gravest situation since 1930, and the middle class, working class and peasantry are increasingly dissatisfied with the Government and the system,'' said Heberto Castillo, who political analysts here believe is likely to emerge as the candidate of a new left-wing coalition. ''They are all thinking of a change, though they don't quite know what.'' **********The right-of-center National Action Party, a strong advocate of free enterprise and Roman Catholic values, differs with the leftist coalition on virtually every point of ideology. But it offers a remarkably similar analysis of Mexico's political situation and the oppportunities it presents for the opposition. **********''There is a climate of discontent and a growing abyss between the people and the Government,'' the party president, Luis H. Alvarez, said in an interview here. ''All the elements for change are in place. Our challenge is to reach out to the great majority, which has been silent and nonparticipative, and convince them that it is the obligation of all Mexicans to create a different Mexico.'' Election Set for July **********The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has been in power since 1929 and has never lost a presidential, senatorial or gubernatorial election, is expected to name its presidential candidate before the end of October. Voting is scheduled for July, and the new President, who is limited to a single six-year term, will take office on Dec. 1, 1988. **********With inflation and the foreign debt both at record levels, the normally weak and divided opposition believes the governing party, known as the PRI, is vulnerable in a way it was not during the 40 years of general prosperity that preceded the current economic crisis, which began in 1982. The parties are also stressing their internal democracy in contrast to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, whose candidate is hand-picked by the incumbent President. **********''The PRI's burden of culpability and errors is so heavy that it hardly matters who carries it,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''Any good intentions of even the best candidate the PRI can offer will be asphyxiated under the weight of the obligations that already exist.'' **********In the past, the National Action Party has been weakened by a reputation of being strong in the north but not truly national in scope and by internal differences, which prevented it from offering a candidate in 1976. But the party, which won 16 percent of the vote in 1982, will hold an open convention in November, at which delegates will choose among several young, articulate and aggressive candidates, including Jesus Gonzalez Schmall, a member of Congress and the party's spokesman on foreign affairs. Left Usually Splintered **********The traditionally splintered parties of the left, which have never won more than 10 percent of the national vote, have already achieved what they see as a major advance. In an open primary election scheduled for Sunday, they choose a single candidate to represent five parties and part of a sixth, gathered under the banner of the new Mexican Socialist Party. **********In hopes of improving its chances, the new party, whose members range from Trotskyists to non-Leninist Socialists, has gone to great lengths to shed anything that would give it a sectarian image. It has dropped the hammer and sickle from its banner, the party platform favors retention of private property ''up to a certain size,'' and Mr. Castillo, the architect of the fusion, has even been addressing businessmen's groups in search of support. **********''The left must understand the difference between the ideal and the real, between what it aspires to and what is possible,'' Mr. Castillo said in a recent interview. ''Some people on the left may not like that, but I am a scientist whose specialty is designing bridges, so with me there is no such thing as dogma.'' **********Thus far, the PRI has given no indication it is worried about electoral challenges, especially not those mounted from the left. When reporters recently asked Fidel Velazquez, a labor leader who is a pillar of the governing party, about the Mexican Socialist Party, he replied, ''Five times zero is still zero.'' Hopes for Leftist Candidate **********But that attitude could change if Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of the Democratic Current, a dissident faction in the governing party, emerges as the candidate of the unified left. Mr. Cardenas, former Governor of the state of Michoacan, is the son of a former President who founded the PRI and is revered by Mexicans for his populist economic policies and strong nationalism. **********Mr. Castillo said that contacts with Mr. Cardenas have been initiated and that he hoped to persuade members of the dissident group to take a place under the left-wing umbrella. Mr. Castillo said that if he won the Socialist nomination and Mr. Cardenas later broke with the PRI and joined the leftist coalition, ''I would be disposed to cede my place to him'' as the sole candidate of the left. **********''I talk to them every day and tell them their place is here,'' Mr. Castillo said. ''They have no future in the PRI, but if they are to work with us, I hope they hurry.

Off to the side stood the country's Moslem minority, regarded as an ethnic group here, and another community of Tamils in the tea plantations, unrelated by history or caste to the Jaffna Tamils. View of the Sinhalese **********To most Sinhalese, the sides were never equal. Behind the Tamil militants, they saw India - the 50 million ethnic Tamils of Tamil Nadu state across the narrow Palk Strait, and beyond them a Government in New Delhi that allowed the guerrillas to train and live on Indian soil. **********Over the last few years, when Tamils died in Jaffna at the hands of Sri Lankan troops, especially in cases involving civilians, there was outrage in Madras and New Delhi. When Tamil militants arrived for sporadic talks with Sri Lankans in foreign cities, they were escorted by Indians. **********When the Sri Lankan Army embarked on an offensive five months ago against the Tamil guerrillas of the Jaffna Peninsula, the Indians dropped relief parcels to the rebels. **********Today, Indian troops are killing Tamils in Jaffna, some reportedly civilians, and the strongest of the Tamil armies, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, has turned its guns and propaganda on the Indians. Now Resented by Tamils **********New Delhi's forces are now combatants, resented by Tamils as well as Moslems and Sinhalese, and seen by all of them as intruders. A high Government official said some Tamil militants who have fallen out with the Liberation Tigers are hiding in Hindu temples in the largely Sinhalese city of Colombo, where they feel safer than in the north. **********The majority of Tamils are Hindus, and the Sinhalese, Buddhists. But this is not a religious conflict; there are Christians in both groups. **********In Sri Lanka, sympathy has strengthened among Tamils for the rebels in areas where they are fighting, to the consternation of Indians. **********The once-solid front among the Sinahalese inside and outside Government, is crumbling as dissension has grown over the invitation of Indian forces into the country. Several Cabinet ministers, among them officials who once advocated a more conciliatory attitude toward the Tamils here, are now critical of the Indian-Sri Lankan accord of July that brought the Indian peacekeeping force to Sri Lanka. Around the country there have been assassinations, thought to be by a radical Sinhalese nationalist group, of Sinhalese local Government officials who had openly supported the accord. **********At the same time, President J. R. Jayewardene, whom Indians not long ago said they found difficult and unpredictable to deal with, has suddenly become a public defender of New Delhi's policies and its troops. **********For the Liberation Tigers and their leader, Velupillai Prabakaran, the world has turned upside down several times this year. A few weeks ago, his Liberation Tigers had been promised a control of a new governing council for northeastern Sri Lanka. **********But then he overplayed his hand, apparently ordering his guerrillas to drive ethnic Sinhalese from their homes in territory he hoped to control in the Eastern Province. The violence that followed left more than 200 Sinhalese dead and villages in ashes. **********Mr. Prabakaran is now a hunted man, pursued by both Sri Lankans and Indians.

He was. **********And it is the place where Juan Lechin Oquendo, the capitalist-baiting labor leader - he regularly proclaims that Bolivia has been sacked over the years by foreigners and the country's own capitalists - has had frequent chats this year over juice and coffee with his good friend Mario Mercado, one of Bolivia's most important businessmen. Contradictions in Style **********Such contradictions in style have been one of the constants in the life and politics of Mr. Lechin, who just stepped aside as leader of the Bolivian Workers' Federation, the labor organization that was born of the 1952 revolution and is often ranked just below the military in power. **********Mr. Lechin is an erect, silver-haired man with an equally silver moustache whose only hint of proletarianism is the open-necked shirt under his elegant sports jacket. He gave his age as 72 years old in an interview last November. Some people say he is a year or two older. **********In a recent interview, he said that anyone wanting to know a man's age should ask his female friends, not the man himself. **********As he likes to point out, he is younger than Victor Paz Estenssoro, now serving his fourth term as President. Mr. Paz will officially turn 80 in October, although Mr. Lechin says the President is already 80. Tin Industry Nationalized **********Mr. Lechin, Mr. Paz and a handful of other leaders of the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement made the revolution that first brought Mr. Paz to the presidency in 1952. **********Together, on Oct. 31, 1952, Mr. Paz and Mr. Lechin signed the decrees nationalizing the holdings of the tin barons, the small group of men that developed and controlled 80 percent of Bolivian mining. Tin, until recently, was responsible for most of Bolivia's foreign exchange. **********The Bolivian Workers' Federation, known by its Spanish acronym, COB, was founded the year the revolutionary forces came to power. Its most important component was the Mineworkers' Federation, of which Mr. Lechin had been executive secretary since 1944. **********He ran both labor groups and at the same time served in the 1952 Government, first as Minister of Mining, later as Vice President. Neither Mr. Lechin nor anyone else in a position at that time to complain saw any conflict of interest in his wearing all those hats. **********''Here, the unions don't just seek economic ends,'' he said in explanation. ''For 40 years the miners have sought to fortify the state.'' Opponent of President **********Today, however, President Paz is trying to turn Bolivia away from statism and toward a more open, free-market economy. At the same time, the collapse of the international tin market has forced Bolivia to close the largest tin mines and dismiss three-fourths of the miners, which, in turn, has greatly debilitated the Mineworkers' Federation. **********Some critics of the President see this as a sellout to his revolutionary past, but Mr. Lechin, now in strident opposition to Mr. Paz, said the President's heart was never in the revolutionary process, that he agreed to nationalization only because the mine workers pushed him along. **********Although Mr. Paz has been widely praised for halting the wild inflation that dominated Bolivia when he returned to office two years ago, Mr. Lechin asked rhetorically which was better: ''That people die from hunger, or that we have economic stability?'' **********Mr. Lechin, whose father was of Lebanese descent, studied at what he called an expensive high school, the American Institute run by the Methodist Church. But family financial difficulties prevented his going to the university. 'Talk to the Rich' **********It was as a result of those early ties to the affluent, he said, that he would ''not refuse to talk to the rich.'' **********Always an avid player of team sports, he said it was his soccer skill that got him a job as a secretary in the mines of Simon I. Patino in 1929. He made one of the company teams on a Sunday and got a job on Monday. **********He left the mines in the mid-1930's to fight in the Chaco War against Paraguay, then worked in a variety of other jobs before being appointed to a municipal government post in the mining district. **********He said it was then that he began to defend the interests of miners, who had not previously been able to face the mine managers and discuss wages and benefits. **********In the long career that followed, he survived one attempt to hang him and two imprisonments of several months each. He also went into exile about 15 times. He was saved from hanging, he said, when miners came out to demonstrate and those holding him decided he was too heavy for any of the branches on the trees. **********Although foreign analysts of Bolivia tend to characterize him as a loose-cannon leftist, Mr. Lechin said he was ''nationalistic and revolutionary.'' 'Policy of Independence' **********''I am not a Communist,'' he said, ''but I follow a policy of political and economic independence for this country. I want a state independent of the United States.'' **********The main thing he did not like, he said, were the ''trans-nationals or big private enterprise.'' **********Saying it was time to devote himself full time to creating his own political party, Mr. Lechin gave up leadership of the miners last year and of the Workers' Federation this year. But he lost the fight at the federation convention last month to name one of his longtime followers as his successor. **********Instead, the federation delegates elected Simon Reyes, a Moscow-line Communist. Some analysts predicted that Mr. Reyes would move cautiously and bring more predictability to the Bolivian labor movement. **********Mr. Lechin implicitly agreed with that when he said that Mr. Reyes's election was a result of ''an alliance of the right of Bolivia, beginning with the Government.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/business/a-debt-accord-for-venezuela.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Debt Accord For Venezuela", "print_headline": "A Debt Accord For Venezuela", "body_text": " **********The government of President Jaime Lusinchi today approved an agreement with creditor banks to reschedule $21 billion of public sector debt. **********After a special session of the cabinet, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters the accord had been unanimously endorsed, and that the documentation would now go to the country's 450 creditor banks for their approval. **********Once the banks approve the rescheduling, a date will be set for the signing, which must take place before Oct. 1. **********Cabinet approval of the agreement came after a month of discord within the ruling Democratic Action party, with some leaders complaining publicly that the terms were not favorable to Venezuela because they included no new credits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/03/world/santiago-journal-death-threats-offstage-but-the-show-goes-on.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1987-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1023, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Santiago Journal; Death Threats Offstage, but the Show Goes On", "print_headline": "Santiago Journal; Death Threats Offstage, but the Show Goes On", "body_text": " **********Through more than 14 years of military rule, many of Chile's theater groups have been islands of criticism and opposition. **********Even in the middle and late 1970's, before much of the press began to show signs of independence from the regime, the country's political situation was being examined with a mixture of bitterness, pathos and humor in a dozen or so small theaters scattered around Santiago. **********That tradition, some actors and directors say, is why 78 of them recently received written death threats, accused of being ''spearheads of international Marxism.'' **********Monday was the deadline set by the group calling itself ''Command 135 -Trizano Cultural Action Pacification'' for the theater people to leave the country.

About 2,000 supporters, some literally sitting on the rafters, listened to the music and the speeches as several hundred others jostled outside with police officers and organizers, who said the building would hold no more. **********The Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet has not commented on the threats, and the theater people have not publicly accused the Government of responsibility. But it is generally assumed that ''Trizano'' - the meaning of the word is not clear - is a right-wing extremist group of the type that have had ties to Government intelligence groups. **********When a visiting Spanish actor, German Cobos, said Monday that he considered the threats ''a form of state terrorism,'' some of the Chilean actors broke into applause. **********The Government threw a partial roadblock into the plans for the Monday night solidarity performance, which had been scheduled for a gymnasium owned by the basketball federation. At the last minute the Government said the gymnasium could not be used for a non-sports event. Actors Told to Flee **********Leaders of the actors' union, who had planned the show, learned of the decision only when they arrived at the gymnasium shortly before starting time and found policemen lined up to turn people away. Eventually, they were able to piece the evening together at the warehouse and disco known as El Garage Internacional. **********The actors and directors said the threats began to arrive on Oct. 30. Twenty-five people reported receiving individually addressed copies of a typed letter. In addition, six theater groups received letters that were presumed to cover all the members of each group, 53 people in all. **********The recipients were advised to flee the country by Nov. 30 or face the possibility of being killed. Some of the actors reported that a later letter to some of them said the threat was intended for those ''who are or would like to be members of clandestine parties,'' apparently a reference to the Communist Party and its armed affiliate, the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front. **********Edgardo Bruna, a stage and television actor who is also president of Sidarte, the actors' union, said he thought the theater people had been singled out because ''since the coup, Chilean actors have had a tradition of telling through our plays what is going on in our country.'' **********He said that actors, like many journalists, politicians, human rights workers and others, had been threatened before but that this was the first threat on such a broad scale. **********Among those threatened before who also received letters this time were Nissim Sharim and Delfina Guzman, leading members of Ictus, a theater group that has performed political works since the 1960's and has won acclaim on foreign tours. Bombs have been discovered twice at Mr. Sharim's house, and both he and Ms. Guzman have reported receiving dozens of threatening telephone calls. **********The most recent play of Ictus, ''Lo Que Esta en el Aire'' - ''Something in the Air'' - is about people who disappear after being detained by authorities. Nearly 700 people have disappeared that way in Chile, most during the first four years of the regime, but five members of the Communist Party have been reported missing since September. Cheerful and Fearful **********The atmosphere was both party-like and fearful when several dozen theater people filed into La Comedia, the home theater of Ictus, for a news conference on Monday. **********Monica Echeverria, a theater director, said she was concerned that the congenial mood might mislead the visitors. In fact, she said, ''we are very afraid.'' **********Mr. Bruna said lawyers for the threatened theater people had gone to court and obtained an order for protection. As a result, the national police agreed to guard the Sidarte headquarters and to send patrol cars periodically by the homes of those threatened. **********In the days after they learned that Mr. Reeve was coming, many of the actors could not resist expounding on the idea that the personification of the comic book hero was flying to their rescue. **********An opposition newsmagazine picked up the theme when it posed a simple question on an otherwise blank page in this week's issue: ''Why is Superman really coming?'' **********On the next page, it showed Superman flying away with General Pinochet cradled in his arms. **********Mr. Reeve, who has won critical acclaim in other roles, was not amused. **********He said this was ''a very serious situation that goes beyond comic books,'' adding, ''I'm here actor to actor, worker to worker, friend to friend.'' My concern is with human rights. No actor should have to perform under these conditions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/19/world/peres-and-russian-meet-on-peace-parley-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1987-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 510, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PERES AND RUSSIAN MEET ON PEACE PARLEY PLAN", "print_headline": "PERES AND RUSSIAN MEET ON PEACE PARLEY PLAN", "body_text": " **********Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel met with the Soviet Ambassador, Yuri V.

Shultz last night on the American position toward a peace conference. **********On the one hand, Mr. Shultz appeared to give a strong Administration endorsement to the idea of an international conference. On the other hand, he tried to distance himself from the idea, saying that neither President Reagan nor he was committed to such a conference, nor would they ask others to make a commitment now. **********Part of the difficulty in interpreting Mr. Shultz's message was that even though his speech had been rewritten several times, he spoke from notes and not from a prepared text. **********''It was not a commitment to a conference in principle,'' one Administration official said. ''It was a qualified endorsement of the idea of a conference. Then you have to fill in the blanks.''

Conable. A former Congressman from upstate New York, Mr. Conable has been the World Bank's head since last August. **********One of the bank's officials, Jacques de Groote, a Belgian who is one of the 12 executive directors, has also challenged the plan with a widely circulated complaint to Mr. Conable, and several senior officials have quit, despite the bank's expressed desires that they stay. **********And because of the preoccupation of the employees with defending their jobs, the bank's principal business of processing loans to developing countries is languishing, according to senior management of the bank as well as other employees. **********The complaint brought by the Staff Association was filed before an institution of the bank known as the Administrative Tribunal, which is made up of prominent attorneys of seven member countries and entirely independent of the bank's management. In matters involving international institutions, American courts have little jurisdiction. **********''It's in their hands,'' Peter Riddleberger, a bank spokesman, said of the tribunal. As for the bank's management, he added that ''it's preparing its response.'' **********Mr. Conable ordered the reorganization in part to make the bank more efficient for the expanded role in managing world debt problems that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d designated for it in October 1985, through a policy that has come to be known as the Baker plan. Orienting the bank away from lending for development projects and toward assistance of countries' general economies was a top objective of the Baker plan, ''Frankly, I think the reorganization has been botched,'' said Vanessa Ruiz, a partner in the Washington firm of Sloan, Lehner & Ruiz, which represents the employees. End to Turmoil Seen **********''The staff is in an uproar,'' said Edward V. K. Jaycox, an American who is a vice president and head of the steering group that designed the reorganization plan. But he said the turmoil should end by September and that the bank would be stronger, less bureaucratic and more responsive to its debtor-country clients. **********The World Bank is one of Washington's biggest bureaucracies, a sibling of the much smaller International Monetary Fund and is sprawled along Pennsylvania Avenue in 17 locations identified by letters of the alphabet. Its payroll exceeds 6,000, with mostly well-educated personnel, 75 percent of whom are foreign. In its 1987 fiscal year, which ended June 30, the bank lent $17.6 billion, $1.3 billion more than in 1986. Today, its board approved an administration budget for 1988 of $690 million, $7 million less than in 1987. **********The bank's adversary in the reorganization, the Staff Association, represents all workers but is quite different from a conventional labor organization. It elects a new head annually from the middle levels of the bank's staff, and its current chairman served as a senior economist specializing in West Africa and is assured of returning to a similar position. **********The reorganization, along with the acrimony over it, is impeding the bank's efforts to fulfill its Baker plan mission. ''Nobody's pulling the debt plan together,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, one of several research organizations that has been receiving job inquiries from economists at the bank. ''It's been a year, and all I can see is reorganization.'' A Cascading Process **********Among other things, the reorganization plan establishes four senior vice presidents, in place of two. The senior vice presidents appoint their immediate subordinates, who then pick their own, and the process continues, in a cascading process from top to bottom through the bank hierarchy. ''The scheme is tainted by the system of subjective choice,'' the complaint says. **********In August, ''round two'' of the process will begin, and will continue through September. Employees who are not selected are encouraged to search throughout the bank for a department that will take them. But some will be disappointed. Management has ordered the elimination of 390 positions and has set aside $101.3 million for those employees' separation pay and pensions and for other purposes of the reorganization, such as retraining."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/30/business/consumer-rates-yields-rise-on-cd-s.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 310, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yields Rise On C.D.'s", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES; Yields Rise On C.D.'s", "body_text": " **********Yields on certificates of deposit rose slightly last week as auctions of Treasury bills were again postponed. **********The Bank Rate Monitor's national index showed an increase of 1 basis point in the yields on six-month, one-year, two-and-a-half-year and five-year C.D.'s., to 6.66 percent, 7.04 percent, 7.45 percent and 7.95 percent, respectively.

These stations carry long-distance telephone traffic from Government offices. It Works Both Ways **********The interception of communications works, of course, both ways. The United States has a secret agency, the National Security Agency, charged with the interception of foreign communications, including those of the Soviet Union. There have been reports that listening equipment on top of the American Embassy in Moscow is being used for that purpose. **********Several members of Congress are urging the Reagan Administration to scrap a 1969 agreement that allowed the United States and the Soviet Union to build new embassies in each other's capitals. **********In Washington, the Soviet Union was given a parcel of land on Mount Alto, one of the highest points in the city. In addition to having a clear view of the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House, the Mount Alto compound also has a good view of the Naval Security Station in northwest Washington, a center for secret naval communications. **********Legislators who want to remove the Russians from Mount Alto also favor razing the new American Embassy building under construction in Moscow, on the ground that it is filled with Soviet listening devices. **********Intelligence experts say that even if the Russians were forced to move from Mount Alto, they would still be able to intercept from embassies and residences in the region. **********''One should not think that just by depriving the Soviets of Mount Alto they would not be able to intercept our communications,'' a Government authority on security said. East European Activity Noted **********Another official, referring to the other Soviet-bloc missions, said, ''They are surrogates of the Soviets in intelligence gathering.'' **********Several officials mentioned as prime listening posts an East German residence on a ridge in Arlington, Va., overlooking Washington, and the Cuban interest section in the Czechoslovak Embassy, two miles from the White House. **********The East German residence is one-third of a mile from the Pentagon. the Polish Embassy, like the Czechoslovak Embassy, is on a hill known as Mount Pleasant overlooking the White House. Moreover, the two diplomatic missions are between the White House and a microwave relay point in northwest Washington near Tenley Circle. **********The Russians use diplomatic compounds elsewhere in the United States to collect intelligence in a similar fashion, the officials said. Microwave traffic along the East Coast is reportedly collected by listening stations at Soviet residential compounds in Glen Cove, L.I., and on the Maryland shore. The officials said a Soviet residence in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco were ideal for microwave interception because of their elevation. Issue of Microwave Interception **********Telephone transmissions travel by microwave or by satellite, as well as by land lines. The Russians are able to intercept much of that, officials say, from an electronic complex at Lourdes, Cuba. **********But the Cuban installation cannot intercept microwave transmissions that travel close to the earth. An expert on intelligence, James Bamford, said the interception of microwave beams required receivers near the relay or repeater stations, which are placed every 30 miles or so to account for the curvature of the earth. **********''Microwaves travel mostly in a straight line between the stations,'' he said. Mr. Bamford and other experts said interception devices did not have to be within a direct line of sight of a relay tower. The beams have side lobes that extend a half a mile or more outside of the direct beam and can be detected. **********A former American official said the present Soviet Embassy in Washington was surrounded by taller buildings that made eavesdropping difficult. **********''Mount Alto lets them do a large volume uninterrupted by lots of interference,'' he said. Reagan Pledge Held Meaningless **********An American University professor who has written on electronic intelligence, Jeffrey T. Richelson, said of the 350-foot Mount Alto, ''It is electronically quieter up there.'' **********Because of the reports that the new American Embassy being built in Moscow is riddled with bugging devices, President Reagan has pledged that the Russians will not be allowed to move into the new embassy on Mount Alto until the United States is satisfied it has a secure embassy in Moscow. But State Department officials say this is meaningless since the Russians already occupy residences on the Mount Alto site, as do the Americans on the Moscow site. **********The National Security Agency, which is also responsible for protecting American communications, has been trying to foil Soviet eavesdropping. Among plans being considered are encoding the signals that travel through the atmosphere or using telephone cables or fiber optics. **********''The way it works now,'' a former official said, ''is that when you pick up a telephone in the Pentagon to make a call, you have no idea how it is going to be transmitted.'' Calls Switched Automatically **********Automatic switching equipment routes the call by land line, satellite or microwave, depending on which method is most efficient at the time. **********Even if a call is sent by land line, it may eventually be transferred to a microwave relay tower at either Tenley Circle or Waldorf, Md., another center for microwave transmission. **********To counter this problem, the National Security Agency has developed a secure telephone that it hopes to place in Government offices and those of military contractors. The device, which encodes a conversation at the sending end and decodes it at the receiving end, is said to be cheaper and less unwieldy than its predecessors. The National Security Agency would like the Government to buy 500,000 such phones. **********But for now, the growing sentiment on Capitol Hill is merely to expel the Russians from Mount Alto. Representative Richard Armey, Republican of Texas, who is sponsoring legislation to scrap the 1969 agreement that designated Mount Alto as the site, has distributed more than 500 lapel buttons saying, ''Reclaim Mt. Alto.'' **********Some security officials said it would be better to allow the Russians to remain at Mount Alto and use the money to protect sensitive communications."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/21/business/investing-buying-mutual-funds-at-the-bank.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallace", "pub_date": "1987-06-21", "snippet": "LEAD: AT least half of typical bank customers would consider switching their savings and checking accounts to another bank if that bank sold mutual funds, according to a recent survey by Market Facts Inc., a Chicago research firm.", "word_count": 951, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTING;\nBuying Mutual Funds at the Bank", "print_headline": "INVESTING;\nBuying Mutual Funds at the Bank", "body_text": " **********LEAD: AT least half of typical bank customers would consider switching their savings and checking accounts to another bank if that bank sold mutual funds, according to a recent survey by Market Facts Inc., a Chicago research firm. **********AT least half of typical bank customers would consider switching their savings and checking accounts to another bank if that bank sold mutual funds, according to a recent survey by Market Facts Inc., a Chicago research firm. **********Afraid of losing customers, banks all over the country - including the Zion Bank in Utah, First Tennessee, Chemical Bank in New York and Continental Illinois in Chicago - have teamed up with mutual fund organizations such as the Dreyfus Corporation, Fidelity Investments and Federated Securities. Chemical began offering its customers mutual funds because of the ''tremendous demand'' for them, said Gary M. Sherman, senior vice president. Investors can now buy mutual funds at almost two-thirds of the country's largest banks. **********Buying mutual funds through a bank provides individuals with convenience and, in some cases, comfort. Depositors can make their investments in stock and bond funds at the same place they bank. And instead of talking to a disembodied voice over a toll-free telephone line, they can sit down with someone they know at their local branch. If a problem arises with a statement, they can discuss it, in person, with someone from the bank. **********But there are costs and limitations involved in such arrangements. Like stockbrokers who sell mutual funds, bankers want to earn the greatest profit on the service. Consequently, many banks are inclined to offer their customers mutual funds that carry a sales ''load'' of 4 to 5 percent of their investment, the bulk of which the bank keeps. A survey by Alliance Capital Management found that 57 percent of the banks provided their customers with load funds last year, up from 31 percent in 1985. Of course, some banks provide no-load funds, such as those offered by Dreyfus and Fidelity, as well. **********Individuals tend to trust their banks. As a result, they expect the bank to provide the best or the most well-known funds. But banks may be more concerned with earning the highest commission and, therefore, like the typical stockbroker, offer only those funds that promised the most profit to the salesman, not necessarily those that offered the best returns to investors. **********Individuals may also face additional costs if they invest in mutual funds through a bank or thrift institution. The banks want to establish relationships with these consumers. At Manufacturers Hanover Trust, for instance, an individual is required to open an account with the bank before he can invest in some of the funds. **********Of course, the Glass-Steagall Act prohibits banks from distributing or promoting mutual funds, activities that are considered risky and better placed in the domain of investment banks. But they can manage the assets or serve as a shareholder agent for funds distributed by other organizations. Depositors at Citibank branches, for example, can pick up information on the Landmark Funds Broker Dealer Services. And Manufacturers Hanover depositors have access to funds managed by Dreyfus and Federated. **********Obviously, buying mutual funds through a bank makes sense chiefly for people who do not know how to or do not want to initiate their own investing program - those who have long depended on brokers or financial planners. ''We're all trying to see how we can reach them,'' said Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus, which has attracted $1.2 billion through arrangements with 190 banks. **********Those who know what they want can do their own research, decide on a fund, pick up the phone and deal directly with organizations such as Fidelity, T. Rowe Price Associates or the Vanguard Group. Those who do not know might walk into one of the 35 banks - including the First Interstate Bank of Wisconsin and the Wilmington Trust Company in Wilmington, Del., - that recently agreed to offer the Liberty funds designed by Federal Securities to be offered to bank customers. The family of Liberty funds includes a money market fund, a tax-exempt money market fund, a traditional growth stock fund, a municipal bond fund, a corporate bond fund and a fund investing only in securities of the Government National Mortgage Association. **********Individuals pay a sales commission of 4 1/2 percent to invest in most of the Liberty funds; the bank keeps 4 percent. The two money market funds have no commission, said James F. Getz, senior vice president of Federated. **********In addition, individuals pay the bank an annual distribution fee of half of 1 percent of the value of their account. On top of that, the customer pays Federated management fees that range upward from three-quarters of 1 percent. **********Individuals, especially if they are paying a sales commission, should demand information detailing how their funds have done over three- and five-year periods, preferably the data prepared by Lipper Analytical Services, an independent monitoring firm. Individuals investing in a growth stock fund or a Ginnie Mae fund, for example, should ask the banker for performance data on similar funds so they can compare results. **********No one yet knows how successful these bank/fund managers, as a group, have been in attracting customer dollars. None of the trade groups keep statistics. The seven funds that Landmark Funds Broker Dealer Services distributes through Citibank have attracted almost $800 million, according to Philip W. Coolidge, vice president of Massachusetts Financial Services, Landmark's parent. Chemical Bank said that a tax-free bond fund managed by its subsidiary had attracted $120 million. **********But its relationship with Fidelity has not been a ''rip-roaring success,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''Equity funds are not an easy sell,'' he said. Many people believe bank customers are more inclined to invest in safer, fixed-income securities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/07/business/avon-stock-trades-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 217, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Avon Stock Trades in Japan", "print_headline": "Avon Stock Trades in Japan", "body_text": " **********Trading begins today in Japan's over-the-counter market for newly issued shares of the Avon Products Company, an offshoot of the American cosmetics concern. **********Trading in the new Avon stock follows a public offering last Tuesday of 27.1 million shares at a price of 1,080 yen a share through underwriters led by the Nomura Securities Company. **********The sale, which represented a 40 percent interest in Avon Products Company, raised about 29 billion yen, or $216.4 million, making it the third-largest initial public offering of stock in Japan since 1984, and the largest in the over-the-counter market in that period. **********The financing was a reminder of how, in the Tokyo market, company share prices are much higher relative to earnings than in the American market.

Harris, chairman of the political science department at the University of Hong Kong. **********Hong Kong, a British territory managed by a British-appointed Governor and other appointed British and local officials, will revert to China in just a decade's time. Some people feel that unless they extract democratic concessions from Britain now they will be unable to get them from China for the period after 1997. Review Is Awaited **********British appointed officials will review the territory's political system this year. But the latest indications are that a significant move toward direct elections of legislators is unlikely to result. **********If directly elected legislators seem less likely now, the bulk of the population seems to be taking the situation with equanimity. The residents of this upwardly mobile jumble of skyscrapers and warrens tend to regard the important things in life as including shark's fin soup, expensive wristwatches and a growing bank account, while public-opinion surveys place politics quite low on the list of priorities. **********Yet concern over the present system has mounted in recent weeks because of several incidents in which officials were accused of ignoring public opinion. This could not be proved, for in the system it is difficult to gauge what the public wants. Nevertheless, the resentment has lingered and infected the political debate over direct elections. **********One of the most recent disputes was caused by the disclosure last month that the Hong Kong Government has been censoring films, apparently without legal authority, for 34 years. The most common objection to the censored films was that they would offend China. Some questionable films reportedly were even sent to the New China News Agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong, for assessment. **********The Government's reaction to the disclosure has been to propose a bill that would correct the defect and provide clear authority for censorship. New Press Law Irks **********Another dispute was caused by a revised press law that provides for fines and up to two years' imprisonment for publishing ''false news which is likely to cause alarm to the public.'' The press in Hong Kong has reacted bitterly. The Chinese-language Hong Kong Daily News, for example, printed an obituary for freedom of the press in the spot normally reserved for its editorials. **********''People are getting more and more frustrated with the Legislative Council going against people's wishes,'' said Albert W. Y. Chan, a Canadian-educated local politician. Like many others in the democratic movement, Mr. Chan suggests that Britain has betrayed the territory. He argues that London places more emphasis on good relations with Beijing than on leaving Hong Kong with democratic protections. **********The concerns of those favoring direct elections were amplified by a cautious inaugural speech this month by Hong Kong's new Governor, Sir David Wilson. Sir David, wearing the traditional white starched uniform of a British colonial governor, warned: **********''If there is to be change, it should be prudent and gradual. It must not disrupt the steady progress we have been making, nor the stability which we prize.'' **********Sir David's sentiments where echoed last week by Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, in comments to Hong Kong leaders visiting Beijing. In the strongest caution so far from China against bold moves toward democratic institutions, Mr. Deng said: **********''The political system in Hong Kong cannot copy that in the West. The present system has gone through one and a half centuries. It is not proper to copy completely the parliamentary system in Britain or the United States and to judge whether this is democracy or not.'' Democracy Provokes Suspicion **********It is not clear whether more people were dismayed by that rebuff to the democratic movement, gladdened by it, or bored by it. From an American perspective, it is striking how suspicious people here are of democracy, because of the turmoil and instability it spawns. **********''Hong Kong might be the only place in the world where, in a free election, the population conceivably would vote not to have a democracy,'' a company chairman mused recently over lunch. **********A poll conducted in late January for The South China Morning Post, a local newspaper, reported that only 6 percent of those interviewed favored the direct election of all legislators. Over all, 34 percent favored the direct election of at least a few legislators, 52 percent opposed any direct elections, and 9 percent had no opinion. **********In a more telling hint at local priorities, only 3 percent of those surveyed said they were ''very interested'' in what electoral system was chosen. Thirty-nine percent said they were ''not at all interested,'' and 43 percent said they were ''slightly interested.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/17/world/south-korea-vote-backs-candidate-of-ruling-party.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1987-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1657, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUTH KOREA VOTE BACKS CANDIDATE OF RULING PARTY", "print_headline": "SOUTH KOREA VOTE BACKS CANDIDATE OF RULING PARTY", "body_text": " **********Roh Tae Woo, the candidate of the Government party, registered a surprisingly sturdy victory today over a divided opposition in South Korea's first genuine presidential election in 16 years. **********But Mr. Roh's triumph was tarnished, and perhaps seriously tainted, by opposition charges of across-the-board cheating and ballot-rigging in the election Wednesday. **********The accusations, most of them difficult to confirm independently and some exaggerated, were nonetheless accepted as articles of faith in dissident circles. Fear of Street Protests **********That belief raised a great risk that South Korea's streets would once again become battle grounds between the police and anti-Government militants who say they will not accept Mr. Roh's victory as fairly earned. **********Unofficial tallies carried on the state-run Korean Broadcasting System showed Mr. Roh with 36.5 percent of the votes after more than 85 percent of them had been counted through early afternoon. **********Far behind were the rival opposition leaders, Kim Young Sam, with about 27 percent, and Kim Dae Jung, with about 26 percent. Another candidate, Kim Jong Pil, had about 8 percent, and a minor party figure, Shin Jeong Yil, had about 3 percent. Hard Words on Both Sides **********People in the opposition camp warned that they would mount sustained protests, and some spoke of revolution to bring down a Government that they call a military dictatorhip. **********For its part, the ruling Democratic Justice Party implied that the Government was prepared to take a hard line. A spokesman, Kim Chung Wi, said in a statement that street demonstrations planned for Friday would be considered ''an act that can hardly escape the people's censure and the just judgment of law.'' **********It appeared that immediate stability depended a good deal on public perceptions of whether the election was by and large fair. That might take a little while to emerge as South Koreans debate whether to accept the fraud charges or to blame opposition politicians for splitting the vote and letting Mr. Roh slip past. **********The answers are likely to determine whether large numbers of ordinary citizens join hard-core anti-Government activists in the streets, and then whether the disorders grow severe enough to prompt military intervention. **********The election returns so far show a surprisingly large spread in Mr. Roh's favor, considering the fact that many political analysts had considered the race to be close. In fact, one analyst said in the days before the balloting that he saw a ''40 percent probability'' that the real contest was between Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung. Mr. Roh showed unexpected strength across the country. In Seoul, which has 25 percent of the electorate and where he had been expected to finish third, he was instead running a narrow second to Kim Dae Jung. **********His plurality of 2 million votes, as of this morning, may bolster charges that the election was rigged, especially from the two Kims and their ardent followers, who had believed that there was no honest way for them to lose. **********On the other hand, the Kims combined had a lead of 3.3 million votes over Mr. Roh, lending credence to complaints -from supporters as well as critics -that it was their inability to set aside personal ambitions that had led to electoral disaster. **********Together, they had about 53 percent of the vote, surpassing the 46 percent that Kim Dae Jung had captured in the last true election, in 1971, when he ran against President Park Chung Hee in a two-man race. **********Final figures from Wednesday's balloting are expected this afternoon. Roh Was Named as Successor **********Mr. Roh (pronounced no), a former general who joined in the 1980 coup that created the present Government of President Chun Doo Hwan, had hoped to inherit the country's highest office by appointment. Mr. Chun, a longtime ally, had designated him as his successor last June. **********But that touched off angry street protests, which spread across South Korea and forced the Government to yield to opposition demands for a direct presidential election and other democratic changes. **********As it turns out, South Koreans have acquired through elections the same leader they would have inherited had there been no demonstrations or changes in the Constitution. **********But Mr. Roh's advisers insist that he will be different from Mr. Chun, despite their similar backgrounds. He will be less authoritarian and more willing to listen, they say, arguing that the events of June made him realize that a more conciliatory leadership style was required for a country of growing prosperity and pluralism. No Statements by Major Rivals **********Mr. Roh, who is to take office Feb. 25, said in a statement this morning that he would strive for ''stability and reconciliation'' and he extended an olive branch to the opposition, saying, ''I will be most willing to listen to their advice.'' **********But he nonetheless took an indirect swipe at his opponents, whom he had denounced during the campaign as bent on bringing chaos to South Korea. He alluded to that theme by calling his triumph ''a victory of the great ordinary people who chose democratic reform with stability and national development without chaos.'' **********At a news conference today, Mr. Roh reiterated a pledge late in the campaign to hold a vote of confidence on his record after the 1988 Seoul Olympics. **********A spokesman for Kim Young Sam said this morning that the Roh victory had been achieved through ''long-planned election rigging,'' which he said led to at least three million votes being ''stolen.'' The spokesman, Kim Jae Kwang, said the ruling camp had campaigned in an ''atmosphere of terror,'' and announced that Kim Young Sam's forces would ''cooperate with dissident organizations'' in resisting the new Roh government. **********Kim Dae Jung had not issued a statement or held a news conference as of this morning. **********A major federation of dissident church and human-rights groups, the National Coalition for Democracy, lost little time in announcing Wednesday that the balloting had been rigged. **********''What took place today was a fraudulent election that was so obvious and of an extent that we have never seen before,'' the group said. It seemed likely that similar statements would come soon from the opposition politicians. **********A rallying point for anti-Government activists could be the Kuro ward office in a working-class section of Seoul south of the Han River, which snakes through the capital. Ballot Box Is Moved **********In one of the more suspicious incidents Wednesday, a woman discovered that election officials were trying to move a ballot box from the ward office, more than six hours before the polls closed. The officials explained that they were simply taking 4,200 absentee ballots to a central counting place. **********But it was not clear why they decided to move the box so early, putting it on the back of an open truck, covering it with packages of dehydrated noodles and pretzels and leaving without any election monitors on hand to guarantee that nothing untoward happened. **********Four young men from Kim Dae Jung's party hurried to the large courtyard outside the ward office and seized control of the box. For hours they sat on it, arms locked, to prevent anyone from taking it. **********In the meantime, other opposition figures rushed to scene and demanded explanations from district leaders. They forced a senior election official, Kang Shil Won, to stand before them in a mock trial, grabbing him by the scruff of his neck and demanding, ''Confess your sins.'' **********Through the day, the Kuro ballot box became an opposition symbol of electoral rigging, and about 2,000 people maintained a vigil in the courtyard through the night. Dozens of Episodes Listed **********The National Coalition for Democracy printed lists outlining dozens of episodes in which they accused the Government or ruling party of fraud. These included switching ballot boxes, using ink that smudged easily to invalidate ballots, and relying on a variety of other techniques such as registering people who were dead, had moved or were under age. **********Other charges were that volunteer observers at polling places had been beaten in some precincts by thugs said to have been hired by the Democratic Justice Party. In turn, the ruling party asserted that more than a dozen of its members had been kidnapped, beaten and kicked by pro-opposition forces. **********Early today nine people were seized by dissidents for purported election fraud and were taken to Kim Dae Jung's headquarters. There, they were forced to kneel and to keep their heads down as they ''confessed'' to their crimes. **********Most of the charges, however, were difficult to verify. For example, allegations of ''relay voting'' repeatedly arose. This is a payoff system in which people are bribed to keep a flow of unmarked ballots in constant circulation for potential use by the ruling party. **********Many anti-Government activists said they had heard of incidents of relay voting, but relatively few actually saw it. Doubts About Some Charges **********Doubts about the many accusations were raised by the leader of an international observer team, one of several foreign groups that had come to watch the election. **********''There does not appear to be, based on what we've seen, widespread election day fraud,'' said Steven Schneebaum of the International Human Rights Law Group. **********Mr. Schneebaum stressed, however, that the observation was confined to election day itself. It did not include the many charges of earlier corruption, including rampant spending by the ruling camp and television coverage on the state-run network that was often biased."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/12/business/company-news-cooper-technicon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cooper Technicon", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Cooper Technicon", "body_text": " **********The Cooper Development Company said that its affiliate, Cooper Technicon Inc., would sell its worldwide industrial systems business, which produces spectroscopy equipment, to Alfa-Laval A.B. of Sweden for about $51 million.

The newspapers' editors like to suggest that they have become the custodians of political opposition and the barometer of democratic revival. **********A debate simmers over the newspapers' effectiveness in molding opinion in this land, where the ruling party monopolizes television and radio to the extent of planning pro-Government commercials for rented home videos. **********A Western diplomat said the newspapers, with a total circulation of around 3 million among the nation's 55 million people, have not kept pace with population growth, while television has spread across the nation. **********''What the referendum made clear,'' the diplomat said, referring to a vote Sept. 6 that narrowly restored political rights to leading former politicians, is that television is very important. ''The Turkish public by and large does not read newspapers.'' **********Thus, the diplomat argued, while the press campaigned virtually unanimously for the restoration of political rights in the referendum, the result offered only a slender victory. **********Those suggestions seem to make journalists bristle. ''The other side of the story,'' said Erturul Ozkok, the Ankara bureau chief of Hurriyet, the country's biggest daily, ''is that at the beginning of the referendum campaign, there was a large proportion of people who wanted to vote 'no' to the lifting of the political bans.'' **********Noting that Prime Minister Ozal wanted to keep the bans, he characterized the press's unanimity in opposition to him as ''a great triumph for Turkish democracy.'' **********Moreover, Mr. Ozkok said in an interview, the formal opposition in Parliament was enfeebled by internal division, so the press ''assumed the role.'' Press Reaches 'the Influential' **********''The press is influential,'' he said, ''because in Turkey we have a political caste, a political elite which is very powerful in forming peoples' opinions. The press reaches these people.'' The debate sometimes wallows in sleazier concerns. Some newspapers, for instance, are restrained only by strict antipornography laws from extending the acreage of female nudity adorning their pages. Others have slid from positions of prestige by trying to match that appeal to potential readers. ''The press,'' said Ilnur Cevik, editor of the English-language Turkish Daily News, ''has lost its reliability, its credibility, because most of the news that they come up with usually comes out wrong.'' He apparently excluded his own publication from the assessment. **********Yet in a land scrutinized by others for clues to its ability to implant democracy after three military interventions in less than 30 years, the bigger issue seems to be not so much the quality as the freedom most editors say they now enjoy. **********During the generals' last period of supremacy, from 1980 to 1983, most newspapers were fettered, closed for varying periods, and under constant scrutiny. **********Laws still prohibit the advocacy of Communism or separatism, or criticism of the period of military rule. Journalists are forbidden from endangering Turkey's relations with other countries. **********The ABC television series ''Amerika,'' which depicted an America under Soviet rule, was withdrawn after Soviet protest. #2 Magazines Seized Two Istanbul weekly magazines were seized this year because of articles about the Kurdish minority, a sensitive matter because authorities do not acknowledge a separate Kurdish identity. **********Some restrictions, said Hassan Cemal, editor of Cumhuriyet, the most respected daily, have led to what he called contradictions.

Col. Oliver L. North ship weapons to Iran and Central America were closely associated with the co-founder of an Australian financial concern that collapsed in 1980, according to an Australian Government investigation. **********The collapse of the financial concern came amid charges that it had laundered money earned from weapons and illicit drug sales. **********Among those linked to the failed Sydney-based concern, Nugan Hand Bank, and its co-founder, Michael J. Hand, was Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general who helped Colonel North conduct airlifts of weapons to the Middle East and Central America, according to the four-year-old Australian investigation. **********The Australian study, parts of which are still secret, was conducted by the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking and was completed in March 1983. Although it is not new, the study is receiving scrutiny again in Washington because of the details about activities and movement of weapons around the world by many of the same figures involved in the Iran-contra affair. Congressional Interest **********The Australian report, which has stirred Congressional interest, also concluded that several former Central Intelligence Agency officials and contract operatives, among them Theodore G. Shackley, Thomas G. Clines and Rafael Quintero, were involved in military and intelligence-related activities with Mr. Hand and other top officers of the Nugan Hand concern. **********The Tower Commission report on the Iran-contra affair and other published reports have linked all of these men to operations in the Middle East and Central America directed by Colonel North, the National Security Council aide dismissed last November. **********Mr. Secord and the other men in the network are the focus of a Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigation. The Australian study, a Congressional aide said, provides additional evidence that will help the committee determine whether this group simultaneously functioned over the years as official Government intelligence agents while also conducting legal and illegal operations for profit. **********''Given the recent revelations about these men, I am greatly concerned,'' said Senator Edward Zorinsky of Nebraska, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, hours before he died of a heart attack Friday. Clues Seen in Study **********Investigators with the Senate and House Select Committees on Iran also are interested in what the Australian study says about Mr. Secord and his network. The study could provide clues to help them understand why Colonel North turned to Mr. Secord. **********The Australian study does not demonstrate that Mr. Secord, Mr. Shackley, Mr. Clines or Mr. Quintero smuggled weapons or narcotics. It does, however, say that these men were close to Mr. Hand, a former Army Green Beret and military intelligence officer who served in Laos during the late 1960's with a C.I.A.-owned airline named Air America. It was the same period in which Mr. Secord played a large role in directing Air America's operations. Mr. Shackley and Mr. Clines were the two top officers of the C.I.A's Laotian station during this period as well, the report said. Mr. Hand, the report said, later worked with these men while he was directing his merchant bank, which he established in the early 1970's with Francis J. Nugan, an Australian. **********The Joint Task Force study was one of four that has been published in Australia since the bank collapsed after the death by suicide of Mr. Nugan in late January 1980 at 37. Six months later, Michael Hand, then 38, disappeared and has still not been found. Agreements and Disipute **********Two other Australian studies confirm the Joint Task Force findings. But the most recent investigation, a Royal Commission study published in 1985, disputes some of the Joint Task Force conclusions. **********During the seven years it was in business, according to the Joint Task Force study, the Nugan Hand bank was engaged in a wide range of legitimate and illegal activities conducted from offices and mail drops in 13 countries in two hemispheres, including the United States, the Cayman Island, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand. The report named 26 reputed drug dealers and provided a schedule of drug traffickers. **********Although reluctant to draw conclusions, the report noted that Mr. Hand did extensive business with American intelligence officers in Southeast Asia in the late 1960's and early 70's, and said there was ''evidence'' that ''Hand retained his U.S. intelligence ties through the 1970's and probably the 1980s.'' The evidence, however, remained classified. **********The Joint Task Force was told by an American witness that Mr. Hand was involved in deals, including a profitable 1976 shipment of 10 million rounds of ammunition and 3,000 weapons, including rifles and machine guns, that went from Boston, through Africa, ''and were eventually delivered to U.S. intelligence supported forces in Angola.'' #1976 Sale to Iran Mr. Hand and his bank, the report said, also took part in the movement by the United States Navy of a ''spy vessel'' to the Iranian Navy in 1976. **********Mr. Hand was said to have taken part in both of these transactions with Edwin P. Wilson, a former C.I.A. agent and head of a secret Navy intelligence group called Task Force 157. Mr. Wilson was arrested in 1982 and later convicted of selling arms and 20 tons of plastic explosive to Libya. **********The report said Mr. Wilson was close to Mr. Secord, Mr. Shackley, Mr. Clines and Mr. Quintero through their participation in intelligence and secret military operations for 20 years. **********Mr. Wilson, the report said, loaned Mr. Clines $500,000 to start a company that ostensibly distributed oil drilling equipment around the world and had offices in Houston. The company, A.P.I. Distributors Inc., also employed Mr. Shackley and Mr. Quintero, the report said. A.P.I. shared office space in Houston with a company controlled by Mr. Wilson, Around the World Shipping and Chartering, which United States officials said was instrumental in smuggling the explosives to Libya. Millions in Deposits **********Mr. Hand and his bank, the Australian study said, did business with Mr. Clines, Mr. Shackley and Mr. Quintero. But the report did not elaborate on the details of the business arrangements. **********The report did note, however, that Mr. Clines deposited ''millions of dollars'' in the Nugan Hand bank. **********On the day that the body of a co-founder, Francis Nugan, was discovered in Australia, said the report, Maurice Bernard Houghton, a top Hand officer and former American special forces team leader, arrived at Mr. Wilson's office in Geneva. According to an unidentified witness, Mr. Houghton left a travel case, then departed. In April, the report said, as the Nugan Hand affair began to cause a stir in Australia, Tom Clines and Rafael Quintero arrived at Mr. Wilson's Geneva office. **********According to the witness, both men ''expressed some concern over what might be in the bag and Tom said that he wanted to take the bag from me.'' The witness said he refused, but the others persisted. ''Eventually the bag was opened in all our presence.'' **********Mr. Clines and Mr. Quintero, the report said, studied the documents inside and removed one. ''During the search, Richard Secord's name was mentioned and Clines said, 'We've got to keep Dick's name out of this.' '' **********Numerous attempts were made to reach Mr. Secord, Mr. Shackley, Mr. Clines, and Mr. Quintero to discuss the Australian Joint Task Force report, without success. The lawyer for Mr. Clines and Mr. Shackley said their clients could not comment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/world/sri-lanka-rebels-and-indian-troops-fight-for-3d-day.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1987-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SRI LANKA REBELS AND INDIAN TROOPS FIGHT FOR 3D DAY", "print_headline": "SRI LANKA REBELS AND INDIAN TROOPS FIGHT FOR 3D DAY", "body_text": " **********Tamil guerrillas attacked Indian peacekeeping forces in the Jaffna Peninsula today with mortars, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, according to Sri Lankan Government radio, and the Indians responded with heavy counterattacks. **********According to Government television reports tonight, 120 Tamil fighters have been killed and a unknown number wounded since Thursday night, when the Indians began to disarm and capture guerrillas defying a peace accord. The Government reported on Saturday that 10 guerrillas had been killed fighting the Indians. **********The Sri Lankan radio said two Indian soldiers were killed today by a land mine in Jaffna. Six or eight Indians -the number is now in dispute - were killed Saturday in the Jaffna area. Sri Lankan authorities reported that at least 19 Indians were wounded today. Enforcing Peace Accord **********Indian Army troops and police officers are in Sri Lanka to enforce the peace agreement that country signed with India in July. Under the agreement, Tamil militants were to turn in their weapons in return for amnesty and a place in the political process which has been dominated by Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority. **********Several hundred Tamils have been captured by Indian troops in the north and east. More than 800 pounds of explosives plus two barrels of gelignite were reportedly seized this weekend in the Trincomalee area, where a munitions factory was also destroyed. Six Tiger camps were raided in Batticaloa. **********Reliable information on the fighting and the casualties on both sides is sketchy and hard to get. The Indians have put Jaffna under indefinite curfew, making movement in the city impossible, and the only casualty figures available come from sketchy reports on Sri Lankan radio and television. Third Day of Gun Battles **********Indian troops ordered civilians in Jaffna to report to designated centers for safety as the peacekeeping forces went into their third day of gun battles with the Tamil militants. **********As Indian troops moved more aggressively into Tamil areas in the Jaffna Peninsula and in the Eastern Province districts of Trincomalee and Batticaloa, refugees from those areas continued to arrive in Colombo and other towns in safe areas. **********More than 10,000 refugees have fled Eastern Province, according to early figures from the Rehabilitation Ministry. In addition, about 15,000 people from the countryside have sought shelter in Trincomalee, which is now under Indian control. **********Nationwide, it is believed that more than 100,000 people have been displaced by four years of guerrilla warfare. The Government had hoped to begin moving them back home after the peace agreement was signed on July 29. Those hopes have now been set aside. **********The latest refugees arriving here, interviewed in temples and other makeshift centers, said Tamil guerrilla bands appeared to have been engaged in an organized campaign over the last two weeks to drive ethnic Sinhalese from areas over which Tamils seek political control. **********A reporter visiting a Buddhist child-care center pressed into service as a refugee camp met a 22-year-old epileptic woman still in a state of shock after her mother was reported burned to death. Another young woman, all her possessions resting on a grass mat, was trying to care for a 14-day-old baby. **********Refugees, almost all of them Sinhalese from rural villages in the Trincomalee or Batticaloa areas, also said that in many cases Indian peacekeeping troops had stood by while settlements were attacked by Tamil guerrillas, who burned their homes and drove them into the jungle. **********Several refugees said they had recognized Indian uniforms or heard people speaking English, not usual among Tamil crowds. They also said Tamil militants had often arrived in villages during curfew hours, sometimes in what appeared to be Indian Army vehicles. **********A 38-year-old refugee from the village of Mihindupura, six miles from Trincomalee, said that when he ran to a military outpost to report an attack on his village by about 40 armed men, he found the Sri Lankan officers he was seeking surrounded by Indian soldiers, who would not let him approach them. **********The man, Wimalaratne, said when he protested, he was pushed back by an Indian soldier with the butt of a rifle. He pulled back his shirt to reveal a bruised and swollen shoulder. **********He is now searching for his wife and children, who had fled toward north-central Sri Lanka, he was later told. All around him were other refugees with similar stories of broken families. **********Another refugee, from Silmapura village, said that as he and dozens of his neighbors fled a Tamil attack on their homes after dark last Monday, Indian troops in the path of their escape fired, killing two people before letting the refugees pass. **********All refugees said, however, that there had been no serious problems with the Indian peacekeeping forces before the end of September, when the Liberation Tigers began violent campaigns against less militant Tamil separatists and against Sinhalese people living in traditional Tamil areas. Role of Tigers' Leader **********Details now beginning to come together indicate that a first round of violence beginning at the end of September may have been ordered by the leader of the Tigers, Vellupillai Prabakaran, after he failed to force the Sri Lankan Government to accept his nominee to head a newly created regional council for the north and east. **********A second round of violence, leaving more than 200 people dead, began Oct. 5 after 14 Tamil Tigers, who had been captured while trying to travel to southern India, committed suicide by swallowing cyanide to avoid being taken into Sri Lankan Government custody. Among the 14 were several important guerrilla leaders. **********Indian troops are reported to have been caught off guard by the outbreaks. They may have also been hampered in their response by rules requiring that military action had to be approved through a chain of command stretching back to New Delhi.

The annual meeting of the company is to be held Tuesday at its Colorado Springs headquarters. **********Ron Barusch, a New York lawyer who is advising Holly, said early today that ''there's been no response'' by the board to either offer. He declined to speculate on which bid Holly might favor. **********The offers for Holly, the nation's second-largest sugar beet processor, follow a series of buyout bids that failed over the last five years. Most of those bids from investor groups came in the last year and collapsed for lack of financing. Bid by a Similar Company **********The bid from Imperial, based in Sugar Land, Tex., is the first from an operating company in a similar business and therefore must be weighed differently by Holly, said Marjorie Crough, a securities analyst with Value Line Inc. in New York. **********She suggested that Plum Associates, an investor group led by Peter R. Harvey, an Illinois businessman, might sweeten its bid. But neither bid ''is a sure thing,'' she said, in view of Holly's history. ''There's been so many deals that fall apart,'' she said. **********In Imperial's merger proposal, each Holly share would be exchanged for $68 cash and stock in the combined company, which would be sold to an employee stock ownership plan at $29 each. Afterward, Holly stockholders and the ESOP would each own 23 percent of the company, with the rest apparently owned by Imperial stockholders. The Kempner family owns 92 percent of Imperial. **********Plum Associates, which owns 7.4 percent of Holly, proposed a $91-a-share tender offer for 66 percent of the company's stock. For the rest, Plum would exchange an undetermined number of preferred shares with a market value of $91. Sugar Cane Used by Imperial **********Imperial's roots stem from a sugar plantation of the Civil War era that was acquired by the Kempner family at a distress sale in 1907. Imperial processes sugar from cane rather than beets. The company earned $3.5 million on sales of $247 million in 1985, the latest year for which figures are available. **********The company is named after New York's Imperial Hotel, which was admired by the company's founders, I. H. Kempner of Galveston, Tex., and W. T. Eldridge of Sugar Land. **********The turmoil at Holly comes as the company's prospects look brighter. In its fiscal year ended March 31, the company's profit doubled, to $4.9 million, on sales of $317 million. Holly holds long-term contracts with beet growers and is aided by Federal price supports. **********''We think Holly is a fine company, and we think the combination would be a good one,'' said Isaac Herbert Kempner, 55 years old, a grandson of Imperial's founder. In the event of a merger, Imperial would shift its business strategy and become a marketer of sugar refined from both cane and beets, he said. Bidding Invitation Is Cited **********Although Holly has been a takeover target for some time, Mr. Kempner said Imperial decided to make its first acquisition attempt only after being invited to enter the bidding by an outside director of Holly. He declined to identify the director. **********Asked if he expected Plum to increase its bid, Mr. Kempner said, ''Not having done this before, I'm not sure what to expect.'' **********Discussions with Holly's managers have been under way for several weeks, he said, declining to specify when they began. **********Representatives of Plum Associates met throughout the weekend with Holly executives, according to Franklin Chu, a managing director for L. F. Rothschild & Company of New York, which has agreed to arrange financing for Plum's offer. **********Mr. Chu declined to say if Plum had revised its proposal as a result of the talks. But because of continuing discussions, he said, Plum will keep its offer - which had been set to expire today - on the table. **********In August Holly ended an agreement with a management buyout group led by Michael Buchsbaum, its former chairman, to buy the company for $133 million. In postponing the bid, he mentioned death threats against him and his family. Winner of a Proxy Battle **********Mr. Buchsbaum gained control of Holly in a proxy fight in 1981, and in 1982 he tried to take the company private in a leveraged buyout. That deal and two others proposed by major investors were also aborted. **********Brookehill Equities Inc., a New York investment concern, and Shamrock Holdings Inc. of Burbank, Calif., each own about 9 percent of Holly. In the past, Brookehill and Shamrock said they might try to seek control of the company. **********Executives of Shamrock and Brookehill did not return telephone calls today. **********The sugar industry has long been buffeted by volatile commodity prices and more recently by declining consumption as people turn to non-caloric sweeteners, said A. C. Greene, director of the Center for Texas Studies at the University of North Texas in Denton. **********Mr. Greene said the Kempner family, which built its first sugar refinery in 1895, helped build sugar ''into the industry it is now.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/17/world/sandinistas-to-call-for-truce.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 208, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sandinistas to Call for Truce", "print_headline": "Sandinistas to Call for Truce", "body_text": " **********A senior Sandinista official said today that his Government was preparing to declare a cease-fire in its war with United States-backed rebels. **********''It will be a sovereign and unilateral act by the Government of Nicaragua,'' said the official, Deputy Interior Minister Luis Carrion Cruz, who is a member of the ruling Sandinista National Directorate.

President Reagan has largely ignored them. He's cut budgets for urban services and housing. He's talked half-heartedly about ''free market'' solutions like enterprise zones and housing vouchers, but he hasn't committed much political capital to either. **********As a result, cities are raising taxes and fees (in highly regressive ways), reducing services further, and turning to their often-strapped state governments for help. A recent survey showed that one-third of our cities expect their main revenue sources to shrink this year; more than half are slicing capital spending. **********The Administration's position is that what is good for business is good for our cities. If cities make themselves attractive to businesses, the argument goes, we won't need urban policies. A little chamber of commerce boosterism, a few tax breaks, and a smidgen of deregulation are all that is necessary. Wrong. That dog won't hunt. Many urban problems simply don't yield to ''free market'' solutions. The evidence is clear. Poverty and unemployment in cities, especially in minority communities, continue at unconscionable levels. The homeless are not merely drunks, drug addicts and former mental patients. They are increasingly the working poor who have slipped through Mr. Reagan's much-touted ''safety net.'' Even middle-class families are finding housing harder to afford. Urban roads and waste facilities continue to deteriorate as we put off repairs. **********True, stagnant economic growth over the past 15 years makes it politically more difficult to pay for Federal urban programs. But much of the decline in urban programs is due not to lack of money, but to priority shifts, especially in favor of defense spending. Cities have been the centers of economic progress and remain critical financial and service hubs today. Moreover, suburbs are now facing many of the same problems that we have associated with big cities. There is a growing political constituency for active, throughtful programs: three-quarters of our people live in metropolitan areas; polls show that not only do voters want better urban services, but they are willing to pay higher taxes to get them. **********The Democrats, whose constituency has historically been urban, have little to be proud of. After all, they dominate Congress and have signed off on the changes that have occurred since 1981. It is crucial that the Democratic Presidential candidates not ignore the cities. **********In an Iowa debate next month, those candidates will be asked to lay out their urban platforms. What they say may determine the flavor of a critical national debate over urban policy. I hope they answer four major questions: **********FIRST, what are you going to do about urban poverty? Some of the poor are trapped in the morass of welfare and welfare dependency. Others toil, often full time, in low-wage jobs and remain poor. Proposals are now on the table to change our welfare system, including ''workfare'' and the nationalization of Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Other proposals deal with the working poor and call for increasing the minimum wage and new training programs. How can we help employable people make the transition from welfare to work? How can we generate better-paying jobs to reduce the number of working poor? **********Next, what will you do about housing? We face a dreadful housing situation for the poor (including the homeless) and near-poor. Not only has Mr. Reagan dismantled subsidized housing programs, but as many as one million units built or rehabilitated during the 1970's will probably be withdrawn from the subsidized housing market. Here is a classic example of the clash between laissez-faire policy and the realities of urban housing markets. President Reagan's offer of a few vouchers to people in markets in which housing is either scarce or too expensive is a sham. What is the Federal Government's proper role in building and allocating housing? Who will pay for livable, affordable housing? Who will build it? **********Third, should we restructure our Federal system? Ronald Reagan's ''new federalism'' turned most of the responsibility for domestic programs over to the states, without the money to pay for them. Cities, which had a pipeline to the Federal Government, have had to fend for themselves and beg at state houses. Many cities have adopted innovative ways to pay for services and to increase employment. Others have been devastated by economic events. A rethinking of how urban aid is to be organized is in order. Is the present system working well? If not, how would you revise it? **********Finally, and most fundamentally, how will you change government priorities in order to meet the needs of cities? All of this, in the end, is a question of priorities. What will you cut elsewhere in the budget and how will you pay for these programs? Will you raise taxes to pay for highways, housing and poverty aid? It is time to face some very tough choices. **********Most people want better and more efficient urban programs. They also want fresh approaches, not a rehashing of old, tired efforts. This means that we need to reshape policies that reflect today's economy and the next decade's social needs. **********The Democrats have a chance to seize this opportunity and bring forward compassionate and far-sighted programs. We will be watching and listening, both in Iowa and beyond."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/24/business/finance-briefs-095587.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 243, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Barclays American Corp., a subsidiary of the British-based Barclays Bank P.L.C., is offering $100 million of 9 1/8 percent notes due in 1997 at 99.75 to yield 9.188 percent through Goldman, Sachs.

A Socialist, for example, was reluctant to concede that any decline had occurred between 1981 and 1986, when both President and Prime Minister were from his party; a Chirac partisan, by contrast, was tempted to liken France to an airplane that had been miraculously pulled out of a nose dive thanks to the right's parliamentary victory in March 1986. **********The professorial Mr. Barre, a man of the right but a challenger to Mr. Chirac for the presidency, deftly refused the word ''decline,'' coining instead one to be found in no dictionary: ''sinistrose.'' Were it a word, it would be a noun connoting a gloomy and menacing condition. **********''The general climate at the current moment,'' said Mr. Barre on one of the in-depth television interviews that so determine political rhythms and fortunes in France, ''is a climate of sinistrose. The French seem to me worried, disoriented, disenchanted.'' **********The only politician who has embraced the ''decline'' theme with unalloyed enthusiasm is Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front. He apocalyptically warns that France is condemned to ''a fatal decadence'' if it does not throw out a lot of third-world immigrants. Keeping Up With the Germans **********Decline in comparison to what? The answer comes through consistently: West Germany, a country where people evidently work harder, strike less, have lower inflation, less unemployment and bigger incomes. **********''They pull together like a real team!'' exclaimed a French steelworker who with a group of his comrades went to visit a Ruhr Valley steel plant where incomes and productivity were 30 percent higher than on his side of the Rhine. The visit was featured on French television in footage that had almost pedagogical overtones. **********The French preoccupation with Germany is hardly new, but it has a keener edge to it falling amidst a bad patch of pessimism. It has been aggravated by the milestone visit to West Germany by the East German leader, Erich Honecker, which rekindled French fears about German reunification, and by the imminence of a superpower accord that will remove American missiles from West Germany, which rekindled other fears about neutralization. **********''Germany is our closest ally,'' said a senior French official, ''but at the same time our views and their views on so many issues - defense, ecology, the analysis of the Soviet Union - are so diametrically opposed. We sit here, on the balcony as it were, watching things happening there and we have so little control over them.'' **********The obsession with Germany slips out in little ways. In a long interview with the newspaper Le Monde, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a Socialist from the party's left wing, announced this month that he would be a candidate for the presidency if Mr. Mitterrand decided not to run for a second term. Yet two-thirds of the interview was about Germany, not France. Twin Themes **********Mr. Chevenement was at once zealous about forging closer military ties with Bonn but irritable that the inflation-conscious Germans had virtually transformed the European Monetary System into a ''mark zone.'' France, he said, needed a more reflationary policy that would increase employment and check the ''catastrophic'' loss of industry here. **********Then, in a sentence that caught twin French fears - decline at home, neutralism abroad - Mr. Chevenement observed: ''There will be no 'European Europe' with a dismantled and sick France any more than there will be one with a neutralized Germany.'' **********The French like to talk about ''les incertitudes allemandes,'' German uncertainties. They are made even worse by the less familiar phenomenon, ''les incertitudes francaises.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/07/business/new-yorkers-co-a-man-with-2478-solutions-to-the-deficit-awaits-a-call.html": {"writer_name": "Albert Scardino", "pub_date": "1987-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1508, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Yorkers & Co.; A Man With 2,478 Solutions To the Deficit Awaits a Call", "print_headline": "New Yorkers & Co.; A Man With 2,478 Solutions To the Deficit Awaits a Call", "body_text": " **********While Congressional committees were picking away at the Federal budget last week, looking for $30-odd billion to cut in the inconclusive war on the Federal budget deficit, J. Peter Grace was flying around the world calling them clowns. **********''They aren't serious,'' he says. ''If they were, they would have called me.'' **********And Peter Grace would have told them, too, just as he has told thousands of others in the last three years, exactly how to cut twice that much without raising taxes a nickel. And then he would have told them how they could go back and do it again next year, for a total of $120 billion, quick, rather than the iffy $76 billion to which the Administration and Congress have tentatively agreed. All Government has to do is to act more like a private business, he would say. W.R. Grace Has Own Problems **********Not like his own business, mind you. Mr. Grace serves as chairman, president and chief executive of W. R. Grace & Company, the conglomerate founded by his grandfather 133 years ago. Last year W. R. Grace lost $472 million on sales of $3.7 billion. **********While much of the red ink came from a restructuring, Grace has drifted downward for years. Earnings for 1985, the year before the overhaul, were less than half what they had been in 1981. But the company, with three good quarters this year, expects to return to profitability when the totals are added up next month. **********So Grace may not be the model. Rather, Congress should adopt the policies recommended by the phalanx of business executives whom Mr. Grace assembled at President Reagan's urging to examine waste in the Federal Government. **********These 2,000 business leaders studied the Federal bureaucracy from top to bottom from 1982 to 1984, then produced 21,000 pages of studies. Official Washington knew them as the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control, but to the rest of the world they were the Grace Commission. **********They discovered that those who serve in the military or work in the Federal civil service retire after many fewer years on the payroll than their counterparts in private industry. And pensions run generously to 75 percent of pay, compared with 50 percent or less in the private sector. **********As a result, Uncle Sam spends six times as much on the pension of a civil service employee, and eight times as much for military retirees, as the best private company spends on its workers. $19 Billion Could Be Saved Reform just that one item and save $19 billion a year, the commission reported. And save even more in the future, because the Government has already agreed to pay pensions that will cost $500 billion - but has set aside no money yet to cover the bill. If you were serious you would also add employees-to-be, but who's counting? Not Congress, Mr. Grace said. Not the Federal Government. **********''That's intellectually dishonest,'' Mr. Grace said. ''It's stealing from the young people of the future.'' **********If the Government can't stomach that reform, Mr. Grace has 2,477 other recommendations, ranging from higher fees in national parks to better cash management techniques for Federal money. Some are being pursued, but none would save nearly so much as the pension changes. Taken together, though, they would reduce the Federal budget gap by more than $420 billion over three years. The Tycoon of 42d Street **********All these ideas to trim the budget are sitting on the shelf, and no one from Capitol Hill even called. **********That's because sometimes it is hard to decide whether Mr. Grace, with his budget-cutting notions, is crazy like a fox, or just crazy. **********For one thing, there is his demeanor. At the age of 74, after 42 years as chief executive of W. R. Grace, he can be seen bouncing through the headquarters on West 42d Street with a mischievous glint in his eye, thumbing his nose playfully at the assistants who try to keep him on schedule in his international travels, tugging his vest down over his tummy without quite popping the buttons. **********In an office overlooking Bryant Park, he has surrounded himself with mementoes of his family: an oil portrait of his father and predecessor, photos of his five daughters, snapshots of family gatherings at one of his four houses and porcelain statues of dogs of all description. Smoking pipes, dozens of them, clutter two desks, the bookshelves and the window sill in the bathroom. **********It is the office of a tycoon, a patriarch. Today Mr. Grace controls only 1 percent of the enterprise that bears his grandfather's name, but he rules it like a fief. He is a holdover from another day, sustaining himself by force of personality. The Grace Coalition **********Then there is his method of waging war on waste. With no visible result, he has spent thousands of hours, and hundreds of thousands of his own and his company's dollars, crisscrossing the country with his message, preaching to the converted in hundreds of business audiences. **********He has enlisted Jack Anderson, the newspaper columnist, as his Sancho Panza in a grass-roots organization known as Citizens Against Government Waste. He has enrolled 164 members of Congress in what he calls the Grace Caucus. **********But Congress, the target of his assaults, pays no attention. As recently as mid-November, Congress dismissed the idea of pension reform and a suspension of automatic increases in Social Security payments - the largest items by far on the Grace Commission's list - as politically unworkable. **********That sounded familiar to Mr. Grace. When his commission delivered its report in 1985, Washington generally pooh-poohed him. He doesn't understand politics, said senators and representatives, lobbyists and Cabinet members. The people who receive Federal pensions vote, they said. The people who receive pensions from private businesses don't elect the board of directors of their company. **********But Peter Grace is in for the long haul. He has outlasted several successors presumptive at W. R. Grace. He endures; they pass from the scene. A Lesson From New York City **********And Mr. Grace has seen government get its comeuppance. He served as a volunteer adviser to Mayor Abraham D. Beame in 1975 as the Mayor struggled without success to prop up New York City's worm-eaten municipal budget. **********''Walter Wriston called me one night when I was on a business trip in Tennessee,'' Mr. Grace recalled. Mr. Wriston at the time was chairman of Citibank and leader of a bankers committee with which the city was negotiating for additional credit. He had a message for Mr. Grace to deliver to Mayor Beame: ''Tell your boy that we aren't going to roll over his loans,'' Mr. Grace remembers Mr. Wriston saying. **********The banks' refusal touched off a panic. Municipal bonds collapsed. Corporations with headquarters in New York accelerated their plans to leave the city. **********''That scared the boys at City Hall,'' Mr. Grace said, with more than a hint of satisfaction that a bunch of politicians had been taught a financial lesson. Nothing else would move them, but the threat of bankruptcy set them to hacking and hewing at the municipal budget. Thousands of police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers lost their jobs, ending the notion that employment with the city meant employment for life. A state agency was given control of the city's finances. **********''Things got better,'' Mr. Grace said. ''The politicians were scared enough to balance the budget. Now the Mayor of New York can spend his time in Nicaragua telling them how to run their Government.'' Federal Problem Is Different **********Though New York overcame its fiscal problems in less than a decade, the Federal Government cannot solve its budget crisis the same way, Mr. Grace said. ''In the first place, they can't go broke,'' he said. ''They can always print more money.'' That explains why the stock market crash has not frightened the Federal Government into a more serious effort to eliminate the deficit, by, for instance, reforming Federal pensions and postponing cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients. **********Mr. Grace thinks the only way to change the spending habits of ''the yellow bellies'' in Washington is for the voters to frighten members of Congress. **********''Moynihan starts getting sensible when Giuliani says he might run against him,'' Mr. Grace said, referring to the Democratic Senator from New York and to the United States Attorney in Manhattan, widely considered a possible opponent next year. **********''Write to Congress,'' he advises the business audiences that hang on his every word. ''If you don't think that'll do it, run for Congress. That ought to scare 'em.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/business/l-empire-replies-106587.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Empire Replies", "print_headline": "Empire Replies", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********I do not recollect ever saying that ''Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield would not use its billing newsletters for education on AIDS'' (Letters, March 22).

But few of them are now stepping forward to be big buyers of stocks again. **********Roy R. Neuberger, one of the legendary risk-takers of Wall Street, is an exception. In the selling panic of Oct. 19 and 20, the founder of Neuberger & Berman, a brokerage and money management firm, was in the market doing what he loves best - trading stocks. He was making rapid-fire decisions to buy stocks that others were dumping, often selling them just hours or days later at quick profits. **********A week earlier the 84-year-old Mr. Neuberger was cooling his heels on the sidelines. Alfred Feinman, a partner at Glickenhaus & Company in New York, said that Mr. Neuberger had nervously confided to him over lunch on Wednesday, Oct. 14, that he had less exposure to stocks than he had had in years. He had thought there was too much speculation in the market, and long-term interest rates of more than 10 percent had convinced him stocks were headed for trouble. Opportunities for a Trader **********The big slide in prices, however, has convinced him there now are plenty of opportunities, for a trader at least. While he is not involved in the direct management of the firm, he visits the office every day, walking more than 40 blocks from his apartment on upper Fifth Avenue to his midtown office. Last week, he sent a memo to the firm's staff, suggesting that now is a good time to buy stocks. **********For years, portfolio managers at his own firm, which manages billions of dollars in pension assets, and other managers, such as Mr. Feinman, eagerly sought Mr. Neuberger's views on the stock market. At major market turns, they have found that he is more often right than wrong. **********''He's performed over the years,'' Mr. Feinman said. Investment Responsibilities **********Mr, Neuberger not only gives out advice to other professional investors and trades for his own account, but also manages the pension fund of a major corporation, said to be the Eastman Kodak Company, and invests 10 accounts for his family. He declined to provide the names of stocks he has been buying recently. **********''I dislike giving tips,'' he said. But he said his portfolios are ''heavily invested'' in stocks. He has been buying stocks of companies that have ''negligible'' debt, large cash positions and strong balance sheets. **********Mr. Neuberger is one of the most active traders on Wall Street. ''If I can make 5 or 10 percent in 15 minutes, you bet I'll do it,'' he said. Yesterday, barely 15 minutes into a meeting in his office, he became nervous when his 24-year-old assistant failed to bring him information on the market. He then walked to his desk and called up information on the Dow industrials from a Quotron machine. **********As Mr. Neuberger has grown older, he has stepped up his trading. **********''I like to trade,'' he said. ''It's a substitute for tennis and other extracurricular activities.'' 'A Good Time to Take a Risk' **********Mr. Neuberger thinks that now -unlike late summer and early fall, when interest rates were climbing and stock prices were at what he considered unjustified levels - is a ''good time to take a risk on the buy side.'' Because he is a trader instead of a long-term investor, he is not as concerned with economic factors as other investors are. This is his kind of market because ''the speculators and gamblers,'' as he calls some traders, ''have moved to the sidelines.'' And he has found many more stocks selling at price-earnings ratios below the market average. **********If the Dow Jones industrial average dropped below the low set on Oct. 19, Mr. Neuberger would be worried. ''I think it would signal the probability of a depression,'' he said. But he thinks that is not likely to happen. **********However, he is prepared to bail out. Should the stock market weaken or if it appears the economy is headed for a recession or worse, he said he would sell his stocks or sell short enough stocks to offset the positions he continues to hold. Perspective on History **********These days Mr. Neuberger's perspective on history makes his views even more intriguing to colleagues. He took his first job on Wall Street in 1929. Thus, his opinion about these rocky times is even more valued. While he sees the obvious similarities between now and the 1920's, he also thinks there are many differences. **********For one, the panic selling of the 1920's was a result of individual investors selling to meet margin calls. This time, he said, the major investors are the billion-dollar pension funds. And he believes they will not dump stocks in a wholesale fashion. **********''They are a safeguard in a panic,'' he said. **********The pension funds are also not likely to be big sellers because they did not have high levels of stocks in their portfolios in October. Many pension accounts had only about 50 percent of their entire funds invested in stocks, Mr. Neuberger said. And that leads him to suspect that, as a group, ''they're just as likely to buy as sell.'' Less Pessimistic Now **********Although Mr. Neuberger spent much of last summer convinced the economy was on the path to a 1930's-like depression, he is not as pessimistic today. ''We're not even sure to have much of a recession,'' he said. He also believes that the panic of the stock market plunge has given the Federal Government the chance to make the necessary changes to forestall a worldwide depression. **********However, he thinks the targets for cuts in the budget and trade deficits are the wrong ones. Mr. Neuberger believes there should be a tax on gasoline of 50 cents a gallon, another tax on imported oil and huge cuts in military spending. **********''This is the way to change history and insure us against a depression,'' he said. Started Investing for Art's Sake **********Mr. Neuberger originally went to work as a trader on Wall Street to make money so he could invest in works of living artists who had not yet been widely recognized. They included Edward Hopper, Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. **********Today, most of his collection is with the Neuberger Collection in Purchase, N.Y. He is an honorary trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. **********But trading stocks still takes up most of Mr. Neuberger's time. The volatility of the marketplace, which can be a nightmare for some investors, provides him with more trading opportunities. Investors who do not trade their portfolios can get into trouble, he feels. **********''Trading is safer than people think,'' he said, ''and investing can be dangerous.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/12/world/shultz-said-to-warn-reagan-of-casey-s-version.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 464, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHULTZ SAID TO WARN REAGAN OF CASEY'S VERSION", "print_headline": "SHULTZ SAID TO WARN REAGAN OF CASEY'S VERSION", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State George P.

Shultz was questioned on historical comparisons involving the Iran-contra affair. **********REPRESENTATIVE DICK CHENEY, Republican of Wyoming. . . . Frankly, Mr. Secretary, one of the things that concerns me about these proceedings is that we develop sort of a hot house atmosphere. We've got . . . the best reporters in the business and some of the most distinguished members of Congress focused on these series of events. But it's sort of a mutually reinforcing kind of an operation. There's a strong incentive on the part of both groups to dramatize these events. They are important events, I don't mean to downplay them at all, but sometimes our intense focus upon the problem we're analyzing, I think obscures some relevent comparisons, if you will, to other periods of time or other events in other Administrations. **********. . . There's a tendency for us to talk about a grave constitutional crisis. Some of my colleagues are fond of saying this is the worst thing that's happened in this country since Watergate. And I must say I have trouble with those arguments, that notion that this is a crisis strikes me as inappropriate. If it ever was a crisis, it ended last December when the President put an end to those policies that are under investigation here. And to the extent that we're focused on enforcing the Boland Amendment, we have to remind ourselves periodically that the Congress repealed that law over a year ago. **********I look at the arguments about Watergate which some of my colleagues on this committee are fond of pulling out as a relevant analogy -and I must say I don't see any relevant comparison at all. I think the analogy is grossly overdone. But you served in the Nixon Administration and went through those difficult years as well, and I just wonder if you would agree with my judgment that what we have here is a radically different set of circumstances, and not a political crime but rather fundamental disputes over policy. And whatever the motives of the individuals involved might have been, and whether we agree or disagree with their policies, it's clear that it was a policy struggle, not a struggle for domestic political advantage, if you will. **********And it's also clear that this President responded very aggressively when he found he had a problem. And contrary to running the so-called coverup that was part of the Watergate incident, this President's done anything but that. He's made available even his own diary to the members of this committee, appointed the Tower Commission, cooperated in every single respect with our activities. I wonder if you might comment . . . **********A. I believe that the Watergate problems were not so much about the burglary as they were about the coverup. That was the essence of the Watergate problem. In this case, we had a set of events involving an initiative toward Iran that were undertaken, broadly speaking, given the finding that we know about, with attention to proper legality. And something happened in the course of that by way of fund diversion which the President didn't know about. And as the events started to tumble out and then especially when the President - and the President set in motion a very quick investigation by the Attorney General, as he began to sense that something was wrong - very quickly -and then when he found something was definitely wrong, he put it out immediately.

Gen. John K. Singlaub, a retired United States Army officer who has played a major role in advising and raising money for the Nicaraguan rebels, is now spending much of his time on what he describes as a treasure hunt in the Philippines. **********The nature of General Singlaub's activities here is not entirely clear. The general and some associates, who include several American military veterans, have received a Government permit to hunt for treasure. They are said to hope to find the ''Yamashita treasure,'' a hoard of gold, jewelry and artifacts said to have been plundered by the Japanese during World War II and hidden in the Philippines. **********But various Philippine sources say General Singlaub, formerly Chief of Staff of United States forces in Korea and later the chairman of the World Anti-Communist League, a private group, may also be engaged in efforts to foster anti-Communist groups here. **********A senior Philippine military officer who said he had been tracking General Singlaub's activities here said today that he believed the general was engaged in ''intense psychological operations'' to lay the groundwork for unofficial counterinsurgency programs. **********As speculation about General Singlaub's purpose here has intensified, he appears to have avoided contacts with the press. Efforts to contact him at an office here were unsuccessful. Visiting as 'Private Citizen' **********Officials of the United States Embassy and the presidential palace said they believed that General Singlaub was engaged only in treasure hunting. **********Allan Croghan, an embassy spokesman, said the general was here ''as a private citizen'' and had no connection with the United States Government. **********Teodoro Locsin, an assistant to President Corazon C. Aquino, said he believed General Singlaub was ''obsessed'' with treasure hunting. He said he had requested permits to hunt treasure in 209 locations and had received permission to hunt at one site, which was not specified. **********An American diplomat said that ''wacky as it may seem'' he was convinced that General Singlaub was really here for the Yamashita treasure. It is named for Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita, the Japanese military commander during the World War II occupation, who was executed for war crimes in 1946. **********According to Philippine and American sources, Ambassador Stephen W. Bosworth approached Philippine officials last year in behalf of General Singlaub's attempt to gain a treasure-hunting permit. Meetings With Business Groups **********But several Philippine sources say General Singlaub has also been meeting with various right-wing and business groups, giving them the impression he is representing the United States Government. He has reportedly encouraged his listeners to defend themselves against the Communist insurgents and the leftists who, some have asserted, hold positions of influence in the Government. **********General Singlaub has reportedly also met with Government officials, including Juan Ponce Enrile, who was then Defense Minister. Mr. Enrile was ousted by Mrs. Aquino in November and is now a leading opposition figure. **********In an interview today, Mr. Enrile said he had met General Singlaub twice, in March or April 1986 and again last fall. ''He was asking me about security for his treasure hunting,'' Mr. Enrile said. ''That's about it.'' **********The latter meeting aroused speculation in local newspapers because it came while dissident military officers appeared to be threatening a coup against President Aquino. **********The senior military officer, who declined to be identified by name, said General Singlaub appeared to be making ''intense psychological preparations for launching a counterinsurgency campaign.'' He said the general was offering ''methods and models of how to fight Communism if the Government does not.'' **********He said the suggestions ''center mainly on self-protection.'' Possibly a 'Cover Activity' **********The officer said he did not believe such activities were a threat to national security, adding that he felt that the country could benefit from having ''a broad anti-Communist party.'' He suggested that a treasure hunt could be ''a complementary activity or a cover activity'' for this project. **********Gen. Luis Villareal, head of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency, said he believed that the treasure hunt was intended to raise money for anti-Communist activities. **********General Villareal, the president of the Filipino Anti-Communist Movement, an affiliate of General Singlaub's group, said the treasure-hunting operations included American veterans of the Korean and Vietnam Wars. **********But both he and the senior military officer said they did not believe General Singlaub was either importing or training mercenaries. **********''That's all false, and I ought to know,'' General Villareal said. He said General Singlaub had given no funds to anti-Communist groups here. **********One well-placed military source said: ''Singlaub comes in and out of the country. He can even land at Clark without our knowing it.'' He was referring to Clark Air Base, a major American installation here. Offers of Weapons Reported **********One man involved in the activities of groups loyal to the former President, Ferdinand E. Marcos, said Americans whom he believed to be associates of General Singlaub had offered weapons and communications equipment to pro-Marcos forces. **********But General Villareal said General Singlaub had turned down requests to meet with the Marcos loyalists. **********General Singlaub has established himself in the Manila office of a Hong Kong-registered company called Nippon Star. The company opened an office last year in a building owned by Raymond Moreno, an associate of Gen. Fabian C. Ver, who was the armed forces Chief of Staff under Mr. Marcos. **********General Singlaub, 65 years old, has served in three wars and was wounded in two, winning 29 medals. **********He retired under pressure in 1978 after criticizing decisions by President Carter to reduce the number of troops in South Korea and to bar production of the neutron bomb. The Korean troop withdrawal plan was later reversed. Tales of the Treasure **********The Yamashita treasure has spawned its own mysteries and legends since the end of the war. In various accounts the loot has been estimated at tens of billions of dollars and is said to have been stashed in 172 locations around the Philippines, marked on a ''super-secret Japanese map.'' **********The treasure is said to be cursed, and tribesmen who have found caches of gold are said to have met with misfortune. There are also stories of a three-foot-high golden Buddha whose hollow stomach was filled with jewels; legend has it that the figure ended up in the hands of Mr. Marcos himself. **********Some former associates of Mr. Marcos say he told them that his own huge wealth came from having discovered the Yamashita treasure."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/27/world/zakinthos-journal-a-greek-drama-tourists-vs-turtles.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1987-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 989, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Greek Drama: Tourists vs. Turtles", "print_headline": "ZAKINTHOS JOURNAL; A Greek Drama: Tourists vs. Turtles", "body_text": " **********The sea turtles are coming again this year. And that, said Christos Pastras, between bouts of wind-surfing and collecting the $4 fee on his beach umbrellas, is a good thing. **********''We love the turtles,'' he said. ''They eat all the jellyfish.'' Not that all his compatriots on this Ionian island agree. Some Greeks, he said, feel that the sooner the turtles -an endangered species called Caretta caretta, or loggerhead - stop coming, the sooner people will be able to build hotels now proscribed by turtle conservation laws. **********And that, Mr. Pastras thought, would be a bad thing. **********The two positions resemble the bookends of a debate about the 200-pound loggerhead, which has long nested on the island. It is a reptile endowed variously with grace in the water and clumsiness on land, and a future that collides with humanity's pursuit of such basics as money, suntans and outboard engines. Between Tourism and Tradition **********''Sometimes they kill them,'' Mr. Pastras said, referring to the foes of the sea turtles and the tactics used to drive the animals away, ''Yes, I think they kill them.'' **********Others see the survival of the turtles threatened in a different way, squeezed, like many things on Greek islands, between the economic gains of tourism and the trauma it often brings to tradition. Here, as in some parts of neighboring Turkey, the turtles are losing in a bitter conflict between preservationists and would-be developers of hotels and mass tourism. **********Each year, said the president of the Society for the Protection of the Sea Turtle, Tomas Arapis, the number of loggerheads making it back to Zakinthos - drawn like spawning salmon by urges not fully understood - is reduced by about a fifth. **********''There are other reasons,'' he said, ''like pollution in the Mediterranean. But we believe the main reason is the pressure of increased tourism.'' Laying Eggs on the Beach **********The female loggerhead, he said, takes about 30 years to reach maturity and readiness for maternity. She then lumbers ashore at night to dig a hole in the beach and lay about 120 eggs, which she covers with sand. The eggs are incubated by the heat of the sand. About 55 days later, the hatchlings scramble out of the hole and dash to the sea. **********An American environmentalist living in Greece, Katherine Butterworth, said the sea turtles laid their eggs three times a season, every 18 days from June to August, but did not usually nest every year. **********They are sensitive creatures, Mr. Arapis said. They dislike bright lights and noise, and shy from beaches cluttered with bright hotels and discotheques and tourists intent on taking a nocturnal snapshot of a nesting turtle. Some, thus, lay their eggs at sea, where they do not hatch. **********And then, Mr. Arapis said, there is the umbrella issue. Renting umbrellas, as Mr. Pastras does, makes money. But driving the umbrellas into the nesting beaches - a practice Mr. Pastras says he avoids - can smash eggs. A Dwindling Population **********Then there are the motorboats that churn the waves and maim turtles, and the hotel lights that bewilder the hatchlings so they never make it to the sea, and new trees that snare hatchlings in their roots, and a host of other problems that, a year ago, prompted some environmentalists to suggest that the turtles would not make it back this year to Laganas beach, their principal nesting ground here. **********But they have returned, albeit depleted. Once, according to Miss Butterworth, there might have been 1,200 to 1,500 turtles here each season; now the estimate is around 700. **********And the turtles are girded with laws that are difficult to enforce -prohibiting nighttime visits to the beaches where they nest and halting development along whole stretches of sand. **********In some parts of Laganas Bay, no new building is permitted, provoking anger from landowners who want a slice of profit from the tourism that has blossomed since the airport here was declared suitable for international flights three years ago. A few years before that, Zakinthos was a different place, and the five-mile sweep of Laganas beach was quiet, save for the wind. Britons Descend **********These days, the island's native population is estimated at 30,000. Each holiday season, however, about 50,000 foreigners, mostly Britons on package tours, fly in aboard aircraft whose flight paths bring them swooping low and loud over a nesting area that is supposed to be still and silent for the turtles. **********A whole section of Laganas beach, the part where Mr. Pastras runs his umbrella business, is said to have been abandoned by the turtles. It now boasts instead a turtle information kiosk, built by the Sea Turtle Protection Society. **********''About 30 percent of the people on the beach ask us for information,'' said Martin Muellauer, an Austrian volunteer turtle protector sporting the insignia of the World Wildlife Fund. ''The rest don't seem to care.'' **********As for the local people, he said, gesturing toward a part of the beach where building is prohibited, ''They are very hostile toward us.'' **********Yet, in other parts of Laganas Bay, on beaches whose names the environmentalists do not want too widely known, those who seek to protect the loggerhead nurture a hope that it may be possible to shelter a limited population of the reptiles from humanity's urge to grow rich and despoil. **********''There must be a critical point when the overall number of loggerhead turtles becomes too small to sustain the species,'' Mr. Arapis said. ''We don't know if we have already got to that point.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/world/jail-riot-quelled-in-brussels.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jail Riot Quelled in Brussels", "print_headline": "Jail Riot Quelled in Brussels", "body_text": " **********The police restored order at a prison in Brussels today after 50 people were injured in rioting by inmates, officials said.

Salesgirls in dark blazers tirelessly unfurl square after square of brilliantly colored silk, patterned with peonies, toucans, and bold geometric shapes. **********The crowd in the wood-panelled shop, which sells everything from hunting attire and luggage to fragrances and silk ties, is the usual holiday mix - mostly Parisian, with fewer of the usual American and Japanese tourists. **********But if the clientele looks younger and decidedly more chic than it did a decade ago, and if the crowd looks bigger, much of the credit goes to one man: Jean-Louis Dumas-Hermes. **********Since becoming chairman 10 years ago, Mr. Dumas-Hermes, a fifth-generation member of the family that founded the company in 1837, has worked to give Hermes (pronounced air-MEZ) a younger image, so that its goods would appeal to say, Lady Di, as much as to the Queen Mother. **********Now the company's products are recognized status symbols. Its silk scarf, which sells for $140 in the United States, and its four-in-hand silk tie at $65, adorn yuppies of all nations. **********''He revolutionized the market for Hermes by repositioning the products without changing the quality,'' said Stanley Marcus, ex-chairman emeritus of Neiman-Marcus, which was among the first to carry Hermes merchandise in America after World War II. **********Indeed, by restructuring, bringing in outsiders and commissioning bolder ads, the 49-year-old chairman not only rejuvenated the image of Hermes, he invigorated sales. Worldwide sales this year at the privately held company are expected to hit $200 million, up from $50 million in 1978. **********SWEEPING into the Paris store, a space-age carbon fiber briefcase in one hand, Mr. Dumas-Hermes, just back from a store opening in San Francisco, addressed the salespeople by name and asked excitedly, but discreetly, how many scarves have been sold. **********Hermes says its sells a silk square every 20 seconds. The record for a single day on rue Faubourg St. Honore, the flagship store of its 210 shops and outlets, is 1,200. On this day it is 886. **********Upstairs in his office, a sanctuary that adjoins a roof garden filled with fruit trees, the dapper chairman talked about tradition and transformation at his 150-year-old company. **********Founded as a harness-making business by Thierry Hermes, the great-great grandfather of Mr. Dumas-Hermes, the company got into travel specialties and golf accessories when the founder's grandson, Emile-Maurice, took control in the 1920's. **********Emile-Maurice also opened the first branch stores in French resort towns, further linking the Hermes name with luxury and leisure. The retail outlet on rue Faubourg St. Honore opened in 1922. **********Surrounded by this lore, Mr. Dumas-Hermes said in his lightly-accented English, he got his Hermes education unconsciously: ''We would all gather around the lunch table every day and my father would talk about 'that-beautiful-silk-scarf-please-don't-eat-with-your-hands.' That sort of thing.'' **********As a young man in Paris, his ambition was to travel, his avocation was jazz. So in the 1950's, after studying political science and law, he began a brief career as a drummer, a job that took him to Scandinavia and Czechoslovakia. ''I was a brilliant impresario,'' he joked, improvising on imaginary drums as he spoke. ''We each got 50 francs a night.'' **********He later traveled through Iran and was a contributing editor to the Pakistan Times. In 1961, he took his compulsory officer training in Algeria. All the while, he gently resisted the pull of Hermes. ''I had nothing against it,'' he said. ''I just had another life.'' **********In the early 1960's, when his father, Robert Dumas, then company president, told him it was time to come home to Hermes, he agreed. But first he spent a year in New York, in the Bloomingdale's buyer training program. (His wife, Rena, whom he married in 1962, got a job in a New York architecture firm.) It was at Bloomingdale's, Mr. Dumas-Hermes says, that he ''discovered the importance of being a merchant.'' At home, at Hermes, he said, ''we were proud to sell, but far more proud to produce.'' **********When he finally arrived at Hermes in 1964, he says, his first lesson was in humility. His father sent him to the Drouot antiques auctions to choose prints for scarf designs, but not one of his selections was ever used by the designers at Hermes. **********He was more successful as head of manufacturing, and by 1971 was managing director. Seven years later, the family voted him chairman. **********His ascendancy surprised him, he says. He is, after all, the fourth, not the first, child in his family. He never assumed things would automatically go his way at the house of Hermes, where the family was not obliged to be part of the company. His own son and daughter, he adds, have no plans to join Hermes. ''Look, we're not the Fendi sisters,'' he said, referring to the Italian family that has built a leather and fur dynasty. **********AS the new chairman at a time when business was slow, Mr. Dumas-Hermes began to tinker with structure. He set up a holding company and developed divisions for fragrances, watches and manufacturing. **********More recently, he reclaimed United States distribution rights for the fragrances from Beecham Products, and signed an agreement with Italian manufacturer Benetton to produce its perfumes. **********He also looked for outside talent. Several family members still hold upper-level positions at Hermes: A sister-in-law, Michele Dumas, is managing director; two cousins, Patrick Guerrand and Bertrand Puesch, are vice chairmen; his wife, architect Rena Dumas, designs the stores. **********But while Mr. Dumas-Hermes appreciates this family legacy, his aim is to run an effective organization. ''The family brings a certain spirit to the business, but it doesn't mean they are entitled to do something,'' he said. ''We try to get the best we can for the job.'' **********For Mr. Dumas-Hermes, that has meant hiring non-family members, among them Gilles du Val, the marketing director, and local managers to direct foreign markets. In the United States, the local talent is Chrysler Fisher, who was hired away from Neiman-Marcus in the early 1980's to head up American operations. **********Under Mr. Fisher, Hermes's American operations started a direct marketing program that includes mail order, 800-numbers and ''how-to'' scarf and tie brochures. To help generate mail-order sales, it also brings craftsmanship demonstrations to smaller American cities with no Hermes outlet. The marketing seems to work. United States sales doubled from 1985 to 1986 and now account for 12 percent of Hermes's worldwide revenues. **********Such companywide restructuring helped Hermes grow worldwide, analysts say. But Mr. Dumas-Hermes's image-polishing helped even more. **********He began looking for an updated image soon after he became chairman. ''I'm afraid we may have been a bit brutal in our assessment, when they asked for an opinion,'' said Francoise Aron, a partner at Hermes's ad agency, Eldorado, and a friend and former schoolmate of Mr. Dumas-Hermes. ''We told them straight that we all knew Hermes, but that it wasn't for anybody who was considered a trend-setter.'' **********ELDORADO worked with Hermes to fix that. In 1979, the silk scarf appeared in French fashion magazines on a ''nana'' (the French equivalent of ''chick'') wearing a Lee Rider denim jacket and Hermes gold earrings. The aviator sunglasses in her pocket reflected a Parisian mansard skyline. Hermes had been jerked up to date. **********The agency, which also handles advertising for Benetton, followed up with ads featuring such company classics as the Kelly handbag done in bright green or red ostrich skin. (The original Kelly, a calfskin bag named for the late Princess Grace of Monaco, is still popular at $1,900.) And last spring, it launched a controversial campaign for the company's Bel Ami fragrance. British women's magazines were scandalized by the ads, which feature a Gustav Klimt sketch of a reclining nude, and British shops were reluctant to use the counter displays. But Hermes has stuck with its ads, and are calling the campaign a success. **********Mr. Dumas-Hermes has other goals for his company, including the doubling of sales in its apparel business. He also wants to exert more control over production and distribution by assuming ownership of certain plants the company uses. **********Just as important, Mr. Dumas-Hermes says, are the things the company will not do. It will not, for example, license the Hermes name. Nor are there plans to go public. ''We have enough money to finance our own growth,'' he said. **********Despite his company's rich history, Mr. Dumas-Hermes likes to talk about his company's place in the modern world. He mentions that there are robots in the printing plant, that the carbon fiber in his new Hermes briefcase is the same as on the exterior of France's Ariane rocket, that the new leather workrooms will be near La Villette, Paris's center for science and technology. ''I don't care about the past,'' he said. ''I am excited by a future based on the past.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/13/world/a-copter-lifeline-on-ecuador-s-river-of-death.html": {"writer_name": "Lidea Chavez", "pub_date": "1987-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1260, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A COPTER LIFELINE ON ECUADOR'S RIVER OF DEATH", "print_headline": "A COPTER LIFELINE ON ECUADOR'S RIVER OF DEATH", "body_text": " **********When a series of earthquakes struck this northeastern region last week, ''it felt like everything was going to end,'' said Aviola Atiz, one of the survivors. **********This village, the last stop on a flight by a relief helicopter that carried an American reporter into the heart of the devastated zone, is one of a number where survivors are totally dependent on helicopters for supplies. **********Officials said 75,000 people in the province of Napo had been cut off from commercial centers by the flooding that followed the earthquakes. The helicopters are flying out of the air base at Lago Agrio, the main distribution center for relief supplies. More Mud Than Vegetation **********A military relief worker aboard one of the helicopters said the worst destruction could not be seen. ''There are whole small villages that were taken by the floods,'' he said. ''They have disappeared.'' **********Bob Moss, an American businessman and amateur radio operator who flew along the the Quijos River this morning, said: ''It looks like someone took those mountains and shook them good. In some areas there is more earth and mud than vegetation.'' **********The International Red Cross has said 300 people are dead and 4,000 missing in the stricken region. Many residents have scattered and it is impossible to determine how many of the missing will eventually be counted among the dead. Dead for Lack of Care **********Col. Ramiro Silva, who is in charge of air relief at the Lago Agrio base, said fatalities could reach 1,000. He put the number of dead now at 400 to 600. **********''San Francisco, San Andres and a lot of small villages of a few families have disappeared,'' he said. ''We don't know how many. We are concentrating our efforts along the river but we also have the rest of the province to worry about. People are isolated and need supplies.  ''There are a lot of people who have not had services for a long time. There are babies and small children who have died for lack of care. We're very limited here.'' Colonel Silva has three Super Puma helicopters for the supply missions and two smaller helicopters for reconnaissance, to gather information on where more supplies are needed. More Helicopters Needed **********He said at least two more Super Pumas and more supplies, such as plastic covering and medicine, were needed. Fuel for the helicopters is also in short supply, he said. **********As the helicopter settled on a clearing near this village, Rafael Guacon ran forward and immediately began unloading bags bulging with rice, sardines, tuna and candy. **********''You have to take some back,'' he shouted to the relief workers. ''There are families on the other side of the river cut off from us.'' **********Twenty bags were quickly reloaded and Mr. Guacon jumped aboard to lead the pilot to survivors across the river, who had laid wood atop thick mud to cross into a small ravine where the helicopter landed. The wood would be easily swept away by rains that threatened to fall later today. **********''On Friday when the river flooded it sounded like five planes taking off and the mud rose 10 feet,'' Mr. Guacon said. **********A woman who lives nearby, Ligia Guzman, said she and her family had been saved because they lived relatively far from the river. **********''The floods took everything along the river,'' she said, her small baby swaddled in blankets and asleep in her arms. ''The mud is high and it's beginning to smell like dead bodies or animals. I don't know how many died -everyone along the river.'' Weather Delays Rescue **********Farther south along the Quijos in places like Reventador, El Salado and Santa Rosa de Quijos, greater numbers of people lived near the river and the casualties were higher, officials said. By late this morning, bad weather made it impossible to land there. **********Maj. Richard Wakefield, an American pilot who is part of an exchange program in Quito and who is making three flights a day to carry out refugees, said the quakes had caused extensive damage. ''The road they say is destroyed,'' he said. ''It is gone.'' **********The Quijos has doubled in size and its clear water has turned into a muddy, swift current. No trace remains of a long cement bridge over the river near the village of Lumbaqui, where people had gathered to be evacuated. **********Small mountains to the side of the river drop off to the east into the jungle, where casualties were minimal but where people are cut off from supplies, officials said. **********The quakes ruptured the country's main oil pipeline, suspending all exports and severely limiting domestic gasoline supplies. Five large tanks near Agualagrio were empty today. **********A spokesman for the American Embassy said it was taking requests for aid, but was unaware of any for more aircraft. Maj. Miguel Argudo, in the Office of Civil Defense in Quito, which is managing the relief effort, said the Government at first believed the three helicopters were sufficent but now realized more were needed. 'There's Nothing Here' **********This morning, when a helicopter took off from Lago Agrio with supplies for five villages, it was loaded so heavily that it began to waver from side to side and the pilot made an unexpected landing. Seven journalists were asked to disembark and wait while the helicopter made one relief stop and lightened its load. **********At every small patch of earth where the helicopter landed, survivors would appear from thickly forested mountains and run toward the relief workers. The force of the downdraft from the helicopter would often lift the tin roofs of nearby houses to reveal small, sparsely furnished rooms. **********''There's nothing here,'' shouted a peasant above the roar of the helicopter when it stopped at the small village called San Pedro de los Cofanes. He said that 20 families lived in the area and that no one he knew had been killed. **********At another stop, a man shouted that medicine was needed, but there was none to be dropped today. **********Colonel Silva said later that there did not appear to be any seriously injured people still in the region, but that survivors needed ''preventive'' medicine because many were living in the open in an area still being shaken by tremors. #1,500 Are Evacuated Some 1,500 people have already been evacuated to Quito and small towns north of Lago Agrio. Dozens of others stand in long lines at the small airport in Lago Agrio waiting for C-130's to take them to join family members in Quito. **********Commercial flights are still operating to Lago Agria, but many of the refugees have no money for a ticket. **********In addition to the river towns, Colonel Silva said, villages east of the river such as Shushufindi and San Francisco de Orellano are also in need of food, gasoline and other aid. **********He said that some of the jungle area in the east could be supplied over a long, circuitous land route and that possibly more air operations could be run from another air base. For the moment, however, the Lago Agria base is the only one being used."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/26/world/iranians-flee-to-turkey-and-dream-of-us.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1987-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRANIANS FLEE TO TURKEY AND DREAM OF U.S.", "print_headline": "IRANIANS FLEE TO TURKEY AND DREAM OF U.S.", "body_text": " **********On most days, outside American diplomatic missions here and elsewhere in Turkey, small knots of people gather -sometimes whole lines of them -clutching documents, some false, and harboring dreams, some in vain. **********A Western official sought briefly for a comparison and then came up with ''Casablanca,'' the film featuring Humphrey Bogart and depicting the Moroccan city filled with fugitives from Nazis - seeking, as one character puts it, the flight to Lisbon and ''a Clipper to America.'' **********Those who gather here by the hundreds of thousands are also seeking refuge. **********But they are Iranians fleeing the Islamic revolution - draft-dodgers, business executives, members of religious minorities including Jews and Bahais, and still others fleeing because of past associations with the Shah. **********Their plight presents a problem without apparent solution. Increasingly, Western officials acknowledge, Western countries, including the United States are reluctant to accept them. **********Turkey has reportedly begun forcing back those Iranians found arriving by horse and truck along the smuggler trails of the mountainous eastern border. But they continue to flee and a business has flourished here. **********Here, in the teeming, tumbledown streets of Aksaray district, as in Signor Ferrari's Blue Parrot Club in ''Casablanca,'' a fugitive may purchase many things: a passport with a replaced photograph (estimated cost: $800); a whole new passport (estimated cost $2,000); forged documents attesting to the existence of a family -fictitious - in the United States, or bogus stamps and seals to lend an official appearance to a false credential. **********Sometimes those who prey on Iranians take the money and disappear. **********A fugitive from Iran, a Western specialist said, might buy passage on a vessel not scrutinized by Turkish port officials, or pay for the temporary distraction of an airport immigration official. It is even whispered that an Iranian man might arrange for an American woman to become his wife and thus allow entry to the United States. **********Turkey has become a reluctant host to the fugitives because it borders Iran and because it does not require Iranians to hold entry visas. **********''Turkey used to be a point of transit for the Iranians,'' a Western said. ''Now it's getting to be a cul-de-sac.'' Another specialist estimated the number of Iranians arriving in Turkey each month at between 5,000 and 10,000. **********But no one seems to know for sure how many Iranians overall have crammed this already bulging city. The minimum estimate by Westerners is 400,000, the maximum 1.5 million. The Turkish Interior Minister, Yildirim Akbulut, put it at 15,000 to 16,000 -a figure regarded as fiction to protect Turkey's awkward position between conflicting pressures. Iran Fears Gathering of Foes **********Iran, a Western diplomat said, does not want Turkey to harbor its foes and malcontents, fearing the growth of an exiled political and military opposition. **********But, a relief official said, Western nations - while leery of Iranians themselves - do not want Turkey to close its doors. Additionally, the Turks, suspicious over Iranian efforts to sponsor Islamic fundamentalism in this secular state, are said to anguish over who some of the Iranians are. **********''It would be no problem at all for Iranians to infiltrate all kinds of people in the stream of fugitives, including fundamentalist agitators,'' a Western specialist said. **********Last year, people thought by diplomats to be Iranian hit men gunned down in Istanbul's streets several people said to be collaborators of the Shah. **********But many Iranians in Turkey seem to boast of a less prominent status. Outside the United States Embassy in Ankara the other day, for instance, two sets of strangers met up to discuss a common goal: visas to America. **********One man, slightly stubbled and accompanied by a woman he said was his married daughter, said he was seeking a visa for her to join a husband already in America. Then, he said, he would return to Iran, where an unmarried daughter was in college, and seek a visa to the United States for her and himself when she had graduated. 'Now There's Nothing' **********Speaking to a reporter but unwilling to be identified, he seemed to show a kind of nostalgia. ''Once we could buy everything,'' he said. ''Now there's nothing. All the country's money goes for bombs for the war. All the young men are at the front. All the professional people have gone.'' **********He gestured toward a young woman. ''Here, you can see her hair,'' he said. ''She wears jeans. At home, she is persecuted if she does not cover herself and wear traditional dress.'' **********The number of Iranians seeking entry to the United States at American missions in Turkey seems to have peaked in 1985, when around 29,000 applied for visas. The figure fell in 1986 to 18,000, according to the U.S. Consulate in Ankara, and is expected to drop a bit this year. On average, 75 percent of the applications are rejected. **********Yet, like flood water pressing on a flawed dam, many Iranians seem to show a persistence and ingenuity in seeking ways to the West. Until last year, for instance, the East German airline Interflug did not require visas for Iranians boarding flights to East Berlin from Ankara. So Iranians would board the planes, and, once in East Berlin, they would cross to West Berlin. **********That loophole has been closed now, and other West European countries, which used to permit fugitives to remain on their soil while their applications for residence were processed, no longer do so, a Western diplomat said. Refugee Proof Required **********''They would come with all kinds of stories - how they had paid $2,000 to be spirited in trucks through Bulgaria to places in Western Europe where the borders are porous - like Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg - or the French-Belgian border,'' the diplomat said. ''On the way they would destroy their passports and claim asylum. Now, if there's no prima facie evidence that they are genuine refugees, they are sent back.'' **********The number of Iranians formally settled as recognized refugees in the West may be higher this year, the official said, because Western countries including Canada and Sweden have shown interest in ''taking the cream.'' **********In the first three months of this year, about 570 Iranians acquired formal refugee status. **********In the movie ''Casablanca,'' there were also unwanted people, locked in intrigue, clawed by those selling promises and passages. And, as the movie's narrator puts it in the opening scenes, the destiny of many is simply ''to wait, and wait, and wait.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/world/freetown-journal-little-beiruts-multiplying-in-africa.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1987-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Freetown Journal; 'Little Beiruts' Multiplying in Africa", "print_headline": "Freetown Journal; 'Little Beiruts' Multiplying in Africa", "body_text": " **********Fleeing Lebanon's civil war, increasing numbers of Lebanese are emigrating to West and Central Africa, sometimes bringing with them the political violence of the Middle East. **********In Freetown, officials charge that the country's wealthiest businessman, an African-Lebanese with close ties to the Shiite Moslem militia Amal, tried to finance a coup attempt last spring. At the time, police officers discovered a weapons cache in the man's villa that included rocket launchers, M-16 and AK-47 automatic rifles and 49,000 rounds of ammunition. **********In Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic, about 40 Lebanese Shiites were expelled last summer after a member of their community hijacked an Air Afrique flight in July and demanded to fly to Beirut. **********In Monrovia, Liberia, a Lebanese Christian woman says she no longer goes to the local Lebanese club on Saturday nights. ''After a few drinks the Hezbollah and the Amal start fighting,'' she said, referring to supporters of rival Shiite groups in Lebanon. A Wave of Thousands **********The violent incidents cast a spotlight on the thousands of Lebanese who came to Africa in recent years to make money in peace. **********These immigrants followed in the tradition of the first modern wave of Lebanese immigrants, Maronite Christians. The Maronites started coming to West Africa a century ago to escape being drafted into the armies of the Ottoman Empire. Some boarded boats thinking they were bound for South America. **********More recently, Lebanon's decade-old civil war and the crash of the Lebanese pound this year have converted the traditional ebb and flow into a one-way flood. **********Long one of the largest non-indigenous groups in West Africa, the Lebanese have become increasingly prominent. In many cities, the Lebanese are increasingly resented by local Africans. **********In the Ivory Coast, the number of Lebanese has jumped from 25,000 a decade ago to about 100,000 today. Senegal and Sierra Leone are believed to have about 25,000 each. **********Abidjan's commercial heart, the Rue de Commerce, is known as Little Beirut for the predominance of Lebanese-owned shops. One of the largest apartment buildings overlooking the Ivory Coast capital's lagoon is called Nabil, which in reverse spells Liban, the French word for Lebanon. **********Last winter, Abidjan's night skyline was marked by Christmas lights strung on a hotel tower in the shape of a gigantic cedar of Lebanon. Beirut Flights Scheduled **********In Sierra Leone, a nation of 3.5 million people, the Lebanese population has become so large that Middle East Airlines inaugurated a weekly flight between Freetown and Beirut last June. **********In shop after shop, Lebanese owners sit behind cash registers, sometimes sipping cups of thick Turkish coffee while they oversee African shop clerks and attend to African customers. **********Lebanese dominance in retail trade has caused racial flare-ups. In January, when students rioted in the provincial town of Kenema, they looted the Lebanese school. In August, the immigration authorities turned away 21 Lebanese arriving on an airplane from Beirut. **********''As far as the Sierra Leoneans are concerned, the Lebanese have come here to exploit us,'' said Franklin Bunting-Davis, editor of an independent Freetown newspaper, New Shaft. **********''This has a lot to do with race,'' he continued. ''There are Gambians here; there are Senegalese. But no one says anything because we are all black. But the Lebanese with his little shop is seen as exploiting us.'' A Prop to the Economy **********The Lebanese, however, see themselves as providing an essential economic service with their expertise in commerce and small trade. Mr. Bunting-Davis acknowledged that if the Lebanese were expelled, the effect would be an economic disaster for Sierra Leone. **********Farid Raymond-Anthony, a Sierra Leonean lawyer of Lebanese descent, lamented the predicament of the Lebanese immigrant in Africa. **********''I was born here, all my friends are here, I speak Krio,'' he said, referring to Sierra Leone's lingua franca. **********''But I go across the river to another town, and I could have arrived yesterday from Lebanon,'' he added. ''It's too bad you can't get blacker with the more time you spend in Africa.'' **********The coup attempt last spring jolted many Sierra Leoneans awake to the fact that their country, a major exporter of gold and diamonds, has become a miniature battleground for Middle East politics. Alliance With Nabih Berri **********Jamil Said Mohammed, the businessman believed to have financed the coup attempt, has long been a major contributor to the Amal militia of Nabih Berri, the Lebanese Justice Minister. The son of a Lebanese merchant and a Sierra Leonean woman, Mr. Jamil was a childhood friend of Mr. Berri, who was born in Bo, Sierra Leone. **********In the past, Palestinian bodyguards supplied by Mr. Berri provided security for Mr. Jamil at his hilltop residence here, which is equipped with a swimming pool and tennis courts. Last year, after a shooting incident at the residence, three guards were expelled. This year, when Mr. Jamil visited Lebanon, Mr. Berri arranged a hero's welcome. **********Apparently because of Sierra Leone's wealth and its liberal immigration policy, this ramshackle capital has gained a reputation along Africa's west coast as a center for Middle East intrigue and diplomacy. **********Last year, Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, visited here. Today, the P.L.O. maintains an office and a medical team here as good-will gestures. **********On Campbell Street, next to the French cultural center, a Cultural Center of the Islamic Republic of Iran recently opened. New Contact With Israel **********Sierra Leone, largely a Moslem country, broke relations with Israel in 1973. But in the last year, two ministers visited Israel. After these visits, the Israelis agreed to develop a national bus service for Sierra Leone and to build about 4,000 low-rent housing units here. **********Indeed, some Sierra Leoneans see the Israelis as a counterweight to the Lebanese. **********President Joseph S. Momoh's predecessor, Siaka Stevens, employed Lebanese security guards. After the coup attempt last spring, Mr. Momoh sent six of his security guards to Israel for training. **********The spillover of Middle East political violence into the region has not gone unnoticed by some companies doing business here. **********After the Air Afrique hijacking in which a French passenger was shot to death, UTA, the French airline, tightened security on its African routes. Now, company security agents are posted at airplane doors where, in a final security check, they frisk passengers and search all carry-on luggage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/18/world/the-iran-contra-grand-jury-is-focusing-on-fund-raiser.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1987-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1003, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE IRAN-CONTRA GRAND JURY IS FOCUSING ON FUND-RAISER", "print_headline": "THE IRAN-CONTRA GRAND JURY IS FOCUSING ON FUND-RAISER", "body_text": " **********The grand jury in the Iran-contra affair has questioned witnesses in recent days about their knowledge of a conservative Washington fund-raiser and his role in providing millions of dollars for Nicaraguan rebel groups, according to lawyers with knowledge of the inquiry. **********They said that a Nicaraguan lawyer who had extensive knowledge of the rebels' financing, Carlos Morales, testified before the grand jury this week and had been questioned about the lobbyist, Carl R. (Spitz) Channell, and groups linked to Mr. Channell. **********The leader of the largest rebel army, Adolfo Calero, has appeared before the grand jury four times and has also been extensively questioned about his dealings with Mr. Channell, the lawyers said. The grand jurors were said to be particularly interested in one specific grant to the contras of about $1 million said to have been raised through Mr. Channell. 'Inordinate Interest' **********It was Mr. Morales who helped Mr. Calero set up dummy corporations in Panama that were used to funnel private aid to the contra rebels. **********One lawyer with knowledge of the grand jury said the special prosecutor in the case, Lawrence E. Walsh, had shown ''inordinate interest'' in recent weeks in Mr. Channell's activities and his ties to contra leaders. Mr. Walsh is overseeing the grand jury. **********Investigators said several weeks ago that they would review Mr. Channell's actions. ''And he is obviously becoming more and more of a concern as the investigation goes on,'' a lawyer said. **********A public relations specialist hired by Mr. Channell, Jared S. Cameron, said his client had been interviewed by Mr. Walsh's staff. He said he was uncertain whether Mr. Channell had yet appeared before the grand jury. Money Said to Go for Weapons **********''I know from speaking to him that he feels that he has committed no crime,'' Mr. Cameron said.  A former fund-raiser for Mr. Channell, Jane E. McLaughlin, spent several hours testifying before the grand jury earlier this month, according to someone with knowledge of her testimony. **********Ms. McLaughlin said in an interview that she believed the fund-raising operation was used to purchase weapons for the contras, and she has provided Mr. Walsh with documents offering a detailed breakdown of Mr. Channell's aid operations. **********Mr. Channell is the president of the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty, a group that has come under intense scrutiny for its efforts to raise millions for the contra supply effort. Mr. Channell worked closely with Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the National Security Council aide who was dismissed in the wake of the Iran-contra affair and who often met with donors. Immunity Vote Expected **********As the grand jury investigation progressed, Congressional officials said the House and Senate committees looking into the Iran-contra affair were expected to vote Wednesday to grant limited immunity to Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's former national security adviser, who was dismissed. **********The immunity would be granted under an agreement with Mr. Walsh that would require Admiral Poindexter to testify before the committees about his role in the case. Investigators have said that he was aware of plans to divert millions of dollars to the contras from the sale of arms to Iran. **********Another former national security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, has reportedly been exhaustively questioned on at least four separate occasions by investigators working for Mr. Walsh. Aid Was Prohibited **********According to lawyers with knowledge of the inquiry, the grand jury is exploring the relationship among Mr. Channell, Colonel North and contra leaders to determine if laws were violated in raising money for the contras. **********From October 1984 to October 1986, the Government was prohibited by Congress from giving direct military aid to the rebels. Individuals are banned from providing arms under the Neutrality Act and other laws, and Federal rules prohibit tax-exempt contributions from being used for arms. **********Mr. Calero has repeatedly been called before the grand jury and asked about Mr. Channell, the lawyers said. **********In a letter recently made available to a reporter, dated Dec. 5, 1985, Mr. Calero wrote to Mr. Channell - ''My dear friend Spitz'' - and thanked him for his support of the contra movement. 'Please Help Us' **********''We need $50,000 through the holiday season,'' Mr. Calero wrote in asking for support for the families of contra fighters. ''Please help us to sustain those who have stayed behind so that those of us on the front lines can survive.'' **********He ended, ''God bless you for your past efforts and constant faith in us.'' **********Mr. Morales's role in the contra supply effort has also intrigued investigators, the lawyers said. There has been no public allegation that Mr. Morales violated any laws. Mr. Morales gave Mr. Calero access to a Miami bank account as a vehicle to receive millions of dollars in funds from private sources wishing to assist the contras. **********In addition, Mr. Morales assisted Mr. Calero in organizing three Panamanian dummy corporations that controlled five other bank accounts in Panama and the Cayman Islands to help channel funds. **********Mr. Calero has said that he gave the bank account numbers to several influential people who offered to help raise private funds, including Colonel North and Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general who was instrumental in the contra supply effort. **********In another aspect of the affair, a Government official confirmed a report in The Washington Post today that Colonel North negotiated an arms-for-hostages deal alone with an Iranian middleman on a secret mission last year to Teheran, but that the deal was ended at the insistence of Mr. McFarlane, who was also on the trip."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/business/personal-finance-when-travelers-can-t-get-off-the-ground.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Rankin", "pub_date": "1987-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "When Travelers Can't Get Off the Ground", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; When Travelers Can't Get Off the Ground", "body_text": " **********AS increasing numbers of travelers take to the skies, spurred in part by the airline industry's deeply discounted promotional fares, there has been an accompanying rise in flight delays and cancellations. The summer travel season is expected to compound the problem. **********Since Federal lawmakers are among the nation's most frequent fliers, they have had ample experience with the aggravation that delays can produce. Their experiences have doubtless proved an incentive to the many pending Congressional proposals that would force the airlines to publicize delays and cancellations. **********''The airlines are where the phone company used to be,'' complained Representative Peter A. DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat. ''Their attitude is, we don't care, and we don't have to care.'' **********Last week, Representative DeFazio and Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, introduced a bill that would require airlines to disclose their policies regarding passenger rights in the case of flight delays and cancellations, overbooking, and lost and delayed luggage. **********As a practical matter, the major domestic airlines already set forth their policies on such matters in a document called the conditions or contract of carriage, an agreement between the passenger and the airline that is considered to be an extension of the ticket and supposed to be available where tickets are sold. **********But few passengers are aware that the document exists, and typically the airlines say in it that they take no responsibility for failure to operate a flight according to schedule and are not liable for any consequential damages. **********''I think people would be appalled to discover that once they purchase a ticket, they forfeit all rights,'' said Representative DeFazio. **********Indeed, the present rules offer little protection to travelers whose plans have been disrupted. With few exceptions, airlines are not required to make amends, even if flight delays or cancellations mean that passengers miss important events - such as business meetings, weddings, or funerals - that were the very reason for flying. **********While airline tickets clearly spell out the consequences if passengers fail to arrive for a flight on time, there is no equivalent responsibility for the airline to deliver passengers to their destination on time. **********''Most people do not understand that airlines do not guarantee their schedules,'' said Cornish F. Hitchcock, legal director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project in Washington. **********Dissatisfaction over flight delays and cancellations accounts for the largest single group of consumer complaints received by the Department of Transportation. Last year, the Department received 12,741 consumer complaints and 3,683 - almost 30 percent - concerned ''flight problems,'' according to Hoyte B. Decker Jr., head of the Department's consumer complaint division. (By contrast, there were 2,583 complaints about baggage, 1,909 complaints about refunds and 1,037 complaints about overbooking.) And the problem of flight delays is worsening. In the first nine months of 1986, the most recent figures available, the Department of Transportation received 1,133 complaints about flight cancellations, or almost twice as many as in the last nine months of 1985. In the first nine months of 1986, complaints about flight delays rose almost 50 percent from the last nine months of 1985. **********Even though there are no formal rules about an airline's responsibility for canceled or delayed flights, there are some practical steps you can take if you find yourself stranded at the airport. Assuming the problem is not due to bad weather that has disrupted the entire air travel system, but rather to some fault of the airline's, such as an equipment breakdown, you should first ask to be placed on the next available flight to your destination. **********Typically, the airline will try to place you on one of its own planes rather than on a competitor's. But if another airline has space available on a flight leaving in one hour, and the next flight on your airline will not leave for five hours, ask that you be placed on the other airline. Your airline is not required to comply, but it might do so as a matter of good will. **********Similarly, if you are flying coach but the only space on the next flight is in first class, ask to be upgraded and placed on that flight. But before boarding, make sure that the airline will absorb the price difference. **********Usually, an airline will pay for amenities such as phone calls, meals and hotels only if your trip is interrupted in mid-flight, rather than delayed or canceled at the outset. Such decisions are likely to be made by airline personnel on the spot, rather than in formal company documents. **********''If a flight is canceled or late, a lot of discretion is given to local management,'' said Stephen D. McGregor, a spokesman for American Airlines. **********But even if these amenities are not automatically offered, they may be forthcoming if you insist on them. ''Even though you don't have any more rights than anybody else, what you get may depend on how assertive you are,'' said Ed Perkins, editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, a monthly newsletter. ''You may have to make a total nuisance of yourself.'' **********If you get no satisfaction from the agent handling your flight, ask to speak with the station manager or general manager. Be reasonable, but let that person know that if your demands are not met, you intend to write to the top management of the airline and to file a complaint with the Department of Transportation. **********The Department says it prefers to receive complaints by telephone so it can handle them promptly; the number is 202-366-2220. But the agency cannot force an airline to take a particular action in your case, so do not count on much practical help. You will have the satisfaction of having your complaint counted in the department's annual compilation of gripes against particular carriers. **********MR. DECKER, of the Department's consumer complaint division, suggests you also send a written complaint to the president or chairman of the airline. Keep your letter brief, and be explicit about what you expect in compensation - whether it is a letter of apology, reimbursement for out-of-pocket costs, a refund on your ticket or a free ticket for future travel. ''The key thing is to say exactly what you want,'' Mr. Decker advised. ''People get so steamed up over what has happened to them that they often forget to say what they want.'' **********You can also send a copy of the letter to the Aviation Consumer Action Project, which may be able to intercede with a carrier. The group has also published a short booklet, ''Facts & Advice for Airline Passengers.'' It is available for $2 by writing to ACAP, Box 19029, Washington, D.C. 20036."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/30/business/taipei-asked-to-revalue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taipei Asked to Revalue", "print_headline": "Taipei Asked to Revalue", "body_text": " **********The United States has asked Taiwan to revalue its currency upward to help the Reagan Administration fight protectionist bills and reduce its large trade deficit, officials said today.

On Tuesday, it even announced a day in advance its intention to supply reserves. A Cushioning Effect **********''The Fed has no obligation to protect stock market profits - that is not its job,'' said Richard Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''But it does have an obligation to limit the secondary effects of a decline in stock prices.'' **********To reduce the impact of those declines on the financial system, the Fed has adopted a two-pronged approach to assure bankers, companies and the public that there is no need to panic and curtail their regular business activities. A stop in the normal flow of borrowing and lending brought on by the stock plunge would almost certainly result in a recession. **********On the one hand, the Fed has assured banks and securities firms that money will be made available to carry them over short-term squeezes brought on by the turmoil in the financial markets. **********The first public sign of the Fed's attitude came early on Oct. 20 - the day after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points - when it issued a statement affirming its ''readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.'' Continued Lending Urged **********To supplement that statement, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York met last week with executives of leading New York banks, urging them to lend to securities firms that are credit-worthy but have suffered a temporary cash shortage during the market downturn. **********Without these steps to encourage the financial community, the Fed would run the risk that banks might worsen the situation on Wall Street by denying loans to credit-worthy securities firms whose borrowing needs are only temporary. Or worse yet, banks might respond to losses on loans to some firms, and a surge in their loans to credit-worthy securities dealers, by cutting back on lending to other sectors of the economy. **********Another aspect of the Fed's crisis management has been its encouragement of a modest decline in interest rates on overnight loans among banks. These rates have declined to about 6 5/8 percent yesterday, down from an average of 7 percent between Oct. 20 and Oct. 27 and about 7 1/2 percent in the four weeks before Oct. 20. **********Although the decline is much less than the drop in other short-term rates, it is seen in the market as a clear sign of Fed policy, relieving the fears of higher interest rates that prevailed earlier this month. **********''I think the Fed's strategy is clear - the only questions are about tactics and how it will orchestrate an easier monetary policy,'' said Dana B. Johnson, a financial economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. ''The Fed will try to be as stimulative as it can, but it has to beware of the risk of a free fall in the dollar and the thinking of people in the markets who still seem to worry about inflation.'' **********Mr. Hoey of Drexel Burnham said that during periods of turmoil, when the demand for safe, liquid securities like Treasury bills is exceptionally strong, the Fed has no choice but to provide liquidity and stabilize the markets. ''You may say in hindsight that there was excess liquidity provided, but that is a necessary price you have to pay,'' he said. Policy Concerns Some **********Some analysts are concerned that the Fed is doing too little in response to the downturn in stocks. **********''The Fed is following the market, not leading the way to a much more aggressive lowering of interest rates,'' said Roger A. Craig, a manager of the fixed-income portfolio at the Banc One Asset Management Corporation, in Columbus, Ohio. ''The downturn in the economy is going to be much more severe than the Fed seems to expect.'' **********Exactly how much economic growth will be reduced, and whether the slowdown will amount to a full-fledged recession, is a matter of debate. Because nobody knows whether the stock market decline will endure or how it will affect consumer and business spending, many analysts expect the Fed to wait a while before it acts more aggressively to ease monetary policy. **********''Given the risk of recession and deflation there's a good case for easing,'' said Mr. Johnson of First National of Chicago, ''but I expect the Fed will wait until it can announce a coordinated move to reduce interest rates by the G-7 countries, or else there is a definite deficit-reduction package out of Washington.'' G-7 refers to the Group of Seven, the leading industrial democracies that meet regularly to coordinate economic policies. **********Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, explained that even if the economy softens in the coming months, the Fed need not act now as if it is facing an imminent recession.  HOW THE FED ACTS TO CALM THE FINANCIAL MARKETS  The Federal Reserve deals on a low-key, day-to-day basis with certain banks and securities firms. Since the market collapse, the Fed has been moving to insure that the nation's financial system has enough money to support the economy's needs. The central bank has done this in a way that the financial markets could not overlook its intentions.  FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK  Temporarily buys securities from some of the 40 banks or securities firms that it recognizes as primary dealers in the Treasury securities market. Fed receives Treasury securities and sends payment to bank or securities dealer. **********Although transactions are temporary, ranging from overnight to three days, Fed has been renewing them when they mature. If the transactions were not renewed, Treasury securities would be returned to banks and dealers, and payment they received earlier would return to Fed.  40 PRIMARY DEALERS  Payment goes to bank's reserve account at New York Fed. This adds to bank's resources, putting it in a better position to make more loans. More money in the system also leads to lower short-term interest rates. (Transactions made with securities firm have the same result, because firm receives Fed's payment through its account at commercial bank.) **********Result: Availability of extra credit and lower interest rates help sustain economic activity despite drop in stock market and strains it has created in financial system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/30/business/business-people-federated-names-chief-for-foley-s-store-chain.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1987-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 308, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Federated Names Chief For Foley's Store Chain", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Federated Names Chief For Foley's Store Chain", "body_text": " **********Federated Department Stores Inc. has named John B.

Yields of several other less actively traded Treasury issues dropped slightly below the 10 percent level reached late last week. **********The economic data for this week include today's announcement of the nation's trade deficit for August. On Friday, the Commerce Department is expected to announce the Producer Price Index for September. Forecasting a Deficit **********Many analysts noted that the trade deficit normally declines in August and have been forecasting a deficit of about $14.5 billion, down from a record $16.5 billion in July. But participants in the foreign exchange and credit markets are unsure about the reaction to such a change. The dollar was slightly stronger in New York yesterday, rising to 143.865 yen and 1.8220 West German marks. **********''I don't think a $14.5 billion deficit is anything to get bullish about,'' said the head of Treasury trading at one New York City bank. Analysts who share this cautious attitude said that a drop to that level was still higher than the $14 billion deficit in August 1986, and might still suggest that the dollar needs to decline further to help increase exports and limit imports. **********Other analysts, however, say a contraction to $14.5 billion is a move in the right direction, and will give the financial markets reason to begin anticipating further reductions in the trade deficit and diminished fears that the dollar's value will fall. Trade Data Uncertainty **********The uncertainty about the trade data, and the markets' response, was one reason why activity in the Treasury market was subdued yesterday. **********''In order to get a significant upside move in bonds, there needs to be more retail participation, and right now they just don't see any reasons to buy,'' said Joseph Kelly, national sales manager for government securities at Prudential-Bache Securities. He said that customers with large losses from previous purchases were waiting to see stability in bond prices before making new commitments. **********But amid the gloom and doom that accompanied the rise in bond yields to nearly 10 percent, from 8 3/4 percent in mid-August and 7 1/2 percent in late March, some analysts see conditions developing that will eventually produce a major bond market rally. **********Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, estimated that within a few months, ''the markets will begin to recognize that over the longer run inflation isn't rising much above 4 percent and the Treasury bond yield can begin to decline towards 8 percent within 18 months.'' **********In a speech at the Financial Industry Conference sponsored in New York by Bear, Stearns, Mr. Kudlow explained that the ability of Congress to restrain spending growth sharply to about 3 1/2 percent annually the last two years from more than 10 percent the previous five years had gone unappreciated by the financial markets. **********In addition, he said the bond markets should be encouraged by recent comments from Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d ''indicating that the Treasury recognizes the threat of inflation and will permit the Fed to continue reducing money supply growth.'' The willingness of Treausry officials to use commodity prices as one guide to economic policy-making ''is another reason to anticipate a more disciplined, anti-inflation economic policy that should be good news for the bond market,'' Mr. Kudlow said. **********In the Treasury bill market, rates on outstanding bills were little changed. But at the weekly auction of new bills, which was delayed one day because of the Columbus Day holiday, the average rate for new three-month bills was up nearly 1/2 percentage point, to 6.96 percent. Six-month bills sold at an average of 7.34 percent, up about 3/8 percentage point. Rise in Short-Term Rates **********The sharp rise for the three-month rate reflected the general increase in all short-term rates the past week, as well as the unusually low rate at last week's three-month bill auction, which was the first issue sold with a 1988 maturity. **********Elsewhere in the short-term sector, fears of a temporary, but sharp rise in overnight interest rates around the end of the year have created an extraordinary difference between interest rates for two-month and three-month securities. Based on the experience of the last two years, when year-end ''window dressing'' of financial statements caused overnight interest rates to soar as high as 30 percent, lenders have demanded sharply higher rates for three-month money compared with two months. **********In the Euro-dollar market, the world's largest market for bank deposits, two-month bank deposits were quoted yesterday at about 8 1/16 percent, with three-month deposits at 8 13/16 percent. That difference implies that the market expects interest rates of about 20 percent during a four day period at year-end. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of new Treasury bills:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)             3-Mo.

Communists won two seats and unaffiliated independent candidates five. **********Elections were held for only 87 seats; three races were halted when candidates died. **********A senior Congress Party leader said the party had lost because of bitter infighting.

He noted that the Congress Party had lost seven statewide elections in the last two years in eastern and southern India. It had also lost to a moderate Sikh party in the Punjab in the fall of 1985. Leader Is Hospitalized **********The alliance in Haryana was led by Devi Lal, a former Chief Minister of the state and a veteran of India's independence movement. Allies and critics alike acknowledged that the 73-year-old Mr. Lal virtually carried the campaign on his own, drawing huge crowds and strong support with his sharp attacks on Mr. Gandhi and the Congress Party. **********Mr. Devi Lal was himself reported to have crushed his Congress Party rival by nearly 30,000 votes in his constituency of Meham.

In a television broadcast, Pranoy Roy, a former adviser to the Prime Minister who runs an opinion research organization, said this became apparent when areas bordering the Punjab voted heavily for the alliance's candidates.

As chairman of the Capital Guardian Trust Company, a Los Angeles-based concern that manages $15 billion, Mr. Kirby has rarely been one to dart in and out of the market. Instead, over a 35-year career Mr. Kirby has tried to spot companies with outstanding earnings potential over the long run. **********Mr. Kirby, who graduated from Harvard Business School, joined the Capital Research and Management Company in 1965, and he and two other executives later founded a sister company, Capital Guardian Trust, to work for retirement trusts, endowment funds and other institutional accounts. Among Mr. Kirby's most prominent clients is Stanford University, where he is a part-time lecturer at the Graduate School of Business. **********As a professional investor who also manages a family of mutual funds, Mr. Kirby has done slightly better than the average mutual fund manager, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which tracks mutual fund performance. **********Mr. Kirby, who lives in California, spends his weekends driving race cars.

He is also chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a one-year position to which he was appointed in December. **********Mr. Opel began at I.B.M. in 1949 as a salesman, and he rose through the sales side of the organization rather than its technical side. During his tenure in the company's top two spots (chief executive as well as chairman), he presided over some of the broadest changes in I.B.M.'s history, including I.B.M.'s entry into the personal computer market and the resulting reorientation of the company's product line toward powerful desktop computers connected by sophisticated telecommunications systems. **********Such technology, particularly the personal computer, has been the chief tool of program traders, who can nearly instantaneously buy and sell huge blocks of stock to take advantage of even the slightest price discrepancies between stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange and derivative financial instruments such as stock options and stock index futures traded on the Chicago futures markets. **********A 1948 graduate of Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., Mr. Opel holds an M.B.A. degree from the University of Chicago.

Stein went to Broadway to play the violin. **********He concluded that this was no way to make a living and found a job at Bache & Company (now Prudential-Bache) selling stock. There he soon decided that the management of investments might be more rewarding. So, according to the Stein legend, he proposed such a department to Bache, which rejected the idea. **********He took the proposal to Jack Dreyfus, head of Dreyfus & Company, then just a brokerage firm. Mr. Dreyfus liked the idea and bought the tiny Nesbitt Fund, changing its name to Dreyfus, with Mr. Stein, then 25, as head of the fund. **********Mr. Stein, who is now 61, loaded up on Polaroid stock and it took off, along with Dreyfus. He bought heavily into American Motors, then another hot stock, and Dreyfus's fame spread. **********In the 1970's, Mr. Stein helped develop the money market fund and worked hard for legislation to create tax-exempt municipal bond funds. Today, with $39.5 billion under management, Dreyfus is only slightly smaller than the $40 billion under management just before the market slide last month. **********The reason, Dreyfus watchers say, is that the company has been accumulating cash for six months. **********Mr. Stein, who earned $1.6 million last year, is described by friends as fully recovered from open-heart surgery about a year and a half ago.

It removes the last major obstacle to starting construction on a tunnel that has been the centuries-old dream of politicians and entrepreneurs and that is seen today as an important step in the further economic and political integration of Europe. **********''It's all done - the money is guaranteed for Eurotunnel now,'' said Rory Macnamara, a London merchant banker working with Eurotunnel on the share offering. ''It's an extraordinary financing for an historic project.'' **********The Eurotunnel financing is also regarded as a breakthrough in raising private funds for huge public works projects. ''This pioneers the concept that the private sector can finance large public utilities,'' said Rupert Darwell, an analyst at Savory Milln Ltd., a London brokerage house. **********The success of the equity underwriting was crucial to the future of the project because the 198 banks that put up the bulk of the financing for the tunnel - $:5 billion, or nearly $9 billion, in loans - stipulated that Eurotunnel could not get access to the loans unless the equity funding was in place. The consortium is scheduled to begin digging the tunnel next month. **********The willingness of London financial houses to make underwriting commitments on the Eurotunnel issue had been in doubt, not only because of the recent stock market collapse, but also because the underwriting came just two weeks after the British Government sold off its 31.5 percent stake in the British Petroleum Company for more than $12 billion. Underwriters in Britain and elsewhere suffered heavy paper losses in that sale. Massive Marketing Blitz **********Still, the Eurotunnel officials pressed ahead, spending the last two weeks trying to convince securities houses, insurance companies and fund managers that the prospects of a tunnel scheduled to open in 1993 would not be much affected by today's skittish stock markets. **********The marketing blitz included a $12 million newspaper and television advertising campaign and a continuous series of luncheon and dinner meetings with financial institutions, headed by Eurotunnel's co-chairman, Alastair Morton, along with Mr. Macnamara, other Eurotunnel officials and the company's bankers and brokers. **********The last-minute drive proved worthwhile as many reluctant financial institutions were eventually persuaded to back Eurotunnel. **********''We feel very pleased here,'' said David Freud, a corporate finance specialist at Warburg Securities, Eurotunnel's lead broker. ''A few weeks ago, a lot of people said this issue would never succeed.'' Strong Support in France **********The Eurotunnel financing is an international offering, although $:707 million, or about $1.23 billion, of it is being underwritten in London and Paris. The overseas issue of $:63 million, or about $110 million, is a private placement that is being sold to major investment institutions in Japan, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. **********The fate of the Eurotunnel financing was clearly going to be decided in the City of London financial district. In France, the other major financier of the project, the backing for Eurotunnel has always been assured. The French Government strongly supports the project and the French financial community is more more tightly controlled by the Government than is the case in Britain. In Britain, Eurotunnel had to win financial support in the marketplace. **********Eurotunnel today priced the 220 million investment units - composed of one French and one British share - at 350 pence, or about $6.10, each. Individual investors can apply for shares until Nov. 27, and trading in the shares, listed on the London and Paris stock exchanges, will begin on Dec. 10. They will not be traded on any exchange in the United States. 'A Unique Solution' **********The British Government's handling of the huge British Petroleum issue, the other major financing in London since the mid-October market plunge, was praised today by John Phelan, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, who is visiting London. Mr. Phelan said the Bank of England's formula of putting a ''floor price'' underneath the shares to calm the financial markets was ''a unique solution'' that ''seemed to be working well.'' **********The markets had feared that the flood of B.P. shares would have a devastating effect on prices. **********Since then, share prices have steadied and the investors' price on the new B.P. shares has remained above the 70 pence a share that the British central bank has guaranteed to pay. The underwriters, however, had agreed to pay 120 pence a share. **********Whether the Bank of England has to honor its commitment on the B.P. floor price in the next several weeks depends largely on the performance of still-volatile stock markets, analysts said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/20/business/ibp-sale-set-by-occidental.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 214, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IBP Sale Set By Occidental", "print_headline": "IBP Sale Set By Occidental", "body_text": " **********As expected, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation said today that it planned to sell to the public 49 percent of its hog and cattle processor, IBP Inc., for between $446.5 million and $517 million. **********The 23.5-million-share offering is expected by market analysts to range in price from $19 to $22 a share, which falls short of some previous estimates.

''Wages overseas will come up, but one way or another, the gap will have to close,'' said Robert E. Mercer, chairman of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Walter Joelson, chief economist at General Electric, added: ''Let's talk about the differences in living standards rather than wages. What in the Bible says we should have a better living standard than others? We have to give back a bit of it.'' **********However the case is put, a common view is emerging. ''Many manufacturers now feel that we are not going to be able to afford the wage difference,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers. Their concern is directed mostly at six countries whose modern, high-tech factories turn out products often competitive with ours. The six are South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore - and each has an average factory wage of less than $3 an hour. **********The new wage talk seems to mean several things. First, it underscores a determination by business to hold on to the wage and benefit concessions won in the early and mid-1980's - and not give them back to labor, even though American products are becoming more competitive on world markets and exports are rising. Second, by focusing on the wage gap, United States manufacturers are shifting the pressures they bring to bear on the labor movement. The concern had been that American factories would be closed, workers laid off and operations moved to low-wage foreign countries. That threat still exists, but a greater effort is being made to keep factories here and to import the low foreign wages, said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at San Diego. ''We'll never close the gap, but that has become a kind of goal,'' he said. **********Finally, the wage gap debate underscores a determination to preserve the cost advantages that have resulted from the dollar's steep devaluation against other major currencies. A roll of Kodak film, for example, can now be sold in Germany or Japan for fewer marks or yen than two years ago, and still bring Kodak the same profit. **********But if Kodak's wages in Rochester rise, then the film's price in marks or yen might have to rise again. That could allow film from Korean or Mexican factories to undersell the American product. ''We all have to meet world standards of cost,'' said John Hackett, chief financial officer at Cummins Engine, a maker of diesel truck engines. **********Put another way, when the dollar is devalued, the prices of goods sold abroad for marks or yen bring home more dollars than they did before. The goods, in effect, rise in price in terms of dollars. If wages fail to rise in tandem - as they did in the late 1970's when the dollar also plunged in value - then the American worker has trouble affording the higher-priced goods. They have to be sold abroad, and his standard of living suffers. **********That is happening today. Net exports are rising, but real wages and benefits in the United States have barely increased in the past year, and those paid to factory workers have actually shrunk in recent months. **********The pressure to standardize factory wages worldwide stems from some well-known causes. Technology and capital are mobile; modern factories are going up in many countries with skilled work forces, and their output can be sold in the United States at competitive prices. But other factors are at work to preserve the American wage advantage - ''enough options that we ought to be able to beat the wage gap dilemma,'' Mr. Jasinowski said. **********The productivity of the American factory worker is rising sharply. Workers are producing more in each hour of labor and therefore can be paid more, without pushing up prices, than less productive third world employees. Political stability in America, easy access to raw materials, an inexpensive distribution system and proximity to the world's richest consumer market all justify locating a factory in this country, even at higher wages. **********But the wage gap is narrowing. The dollar's plunge has pushed West Germany's hourly compensation to the equivalent of $16.09, and the level in Japan, France and Italy has risen to between $11 and $12 - close to the $13.09 in the United States. The devaluation has not had much effect on the dollar value of wages in third world countries because most of their currencies are tied to the dollar. But an index of hourly compensation adjusted for inflation, prepared by the Conference Board, shows that real wages in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong have gained ground on United States pay in the past 10 years. **********The process is slow, however. Years before American and third world factory wages ever meet, the wage gap within the United States might close. Manufacturing wages in this country are still roughly twice those in the service industry, but service industry pay has been rising at a faster clip than factory wages."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/world/soviet-says-it-is-giving-up-commercial-whaling.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1987-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 751, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET SAYS IT IS GIVING UP COMMERCIAL WHALING", "print_headline": "SOVIET SAYS IT IS GIVING UP COMMERCIAL WHALING", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union has announced that it is halting commercial whaling, and its last whaling fleet is heading home from its final season in the Antarctic. **********The announcement, reported on the Moscow radio on Friday night, said the flagship of the fleet, based in the Black Sea port of Odessa, would be converted to a fisheries ship, indicating that the halt is to be permanent and not temporary, as the Russians had previously said. **********Environmental groups say the Soviet Union now has the world's largest catch of whales, taking about half the total each year into its huge refrigerated factory ships in the Antarctic. **********A spokesman for the environmental group Greenpeace said the group, which has long fought for an end to commercial whaling, had been told in advance of the ban by Yevgeny P. Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. **********''It's very welcome news,'' said Peter Dykstra, the Greenpeace spokesman. ''The bloc of whaling nations has grown significantly smaller.'' **********Soviet officials said in 1985 that commercial whaling would be stopped by 1987, but they said the ban would be temporary. Environmentalists had expressed uncertainty about the promise, noting that similar statements had been made in the past and not fulfilled. **********''We have every reason to believe that this one is genuine,'' Mr. Dykstra said. **********The radio report said the decision was made after consultations with scientists and conservationists. Western experts said, however, that the Soviet Union had strong economic incentives as well. For one thing, Soviet fishing in United States territorial waters has been restricted because of sanctions imposed in 1985 for Soviet whaling activities. Ending whaling could open the way for lucrative, expanded Soviet fishing rights. **********In 1978, Congress enacted fishing laws tied to International Whaling Commission rules. Congress specified that if any nation was found to ''diminish the effectiveness'' of the commission, the amount of fish caught in American waters by that country would be halved. If violations continued, the nation would lose its allocation. **********In 1985, the United States found the Soviet Union in violation of whaling commission rules and cut its allocation in half. A year later, after determining that the Russians were still breaking regulations, the United States barred Russian trawlers from catching any fish in American waters. **********Environmentalists said that the Odessa whaling fleet was old and in poor condition and that the dwindling whale population did not bring enough profit to justify refitting the flotilla. **********A Greenpeace lobbyist in Washington, Dean Wilkinson, said the Soviet Union caught about 3,000 whales last year and was believed to have taken a similar number in the season just ended. The Soviet Union sells most of its catch to the Japanese. Another Economic Factor **********Mr. Wilkinson said another economic factor in the Soviet decision to stop catching whales was the threat of American sanctions against Japan, thus choking off the only Soviet market for whale meat. **********Grudgingly and under the American threat of a reduced fish catch in American waters, Japan has agreed to phase out commercial whaling by next April. But early last month, the Government announced that it was invoking its rights under whaling commission rules to send out the same fleet next winter for what it called research whaling. **********Other nations with whaling fleets are Norway, Iceland, South Korea and the Philippines. These nations operate despite a moratorium imposed in 1986 by the International Whaling Commission. Except for the Soviet Union, all the countries hunt under a loophole that permits ''scientific whaling'' for research. **********The Soviet Union instead filed an official objection to the moratorium as politically motivated and said that claims that some whale species faced extinction were exaggerated. **********The radio report today did not indicate whether the Russians would withdraw their objection to the whaling moratorium. **********Until the early 1980's, the Soviet Union also operated two whaling fleets in the Pacific, but they were discontinued after the whaling commission banned the use of factory ships except in the Antarctic. **********The whaling halt is in line with recent environmental measures in the Soviet Union, including the decision last year to stop a river diversion project in Siberia."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/08/business/company-news-598587.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;", "body_text": " **********Two former executives of Refco International Futures have been awarded $30 million by a Federal District Court jury in Manhattan after they charged that the firm and its largest partner, Thomas H.

A strategic hilltop, thick walls and crenelated turrets have all helped win some battles, but when Monticchiello was threatened with becoming a dump for toxic wastes, the villagers resorted to their favorite form of self-defense. They put on a play. **********Every summer for 20 years the farmers and artisans of Monticchiello have performed a drama of their own creation. Every play has been based on an event, real or legendary, in the life of the village. Medieval heroines and hermits, a battle between resistance fighters and Fascist troops, women's liberation and the problems of the elderly have all provided material. **********Although the theme changes each year, it is always the threat posed by modernity that sends these people out under starry skies to recite speeches and sing songs. **********''This is theater as a means of survival,'' said Mario Guidotti, who left the village as a young man to become a journalist in Rome but returns to help guide the summer dramas. Each year, he said, ''Monticchiello affirms its identity by addressing an issue of everyday concern.'' Garbage Barge Remembered **********''Bewitched Bread,'' the play that is to be performed 14 times this summer, was inspired in part by the wanderings of the Long Island garbage barge as well as plans to bury poisoned refuse in the valley below the village. The Monticchiello players took their own peculiar approach to environmental issues, and like many others before found difficulties not easily resolved. **********The easiest way to Monticchiello, 25 miles southeast of Siena, is on the road that was paved for theatergoers after the plays became famous. The first view of the village comes at the end of a forest said to be thick with wild boars and Etruscan tombs. Medieval towers and sharply angled walls are the only things clearly in sight, making the hilltop look like a battleship at anchor in a fog. **********The village itself seems a perpetually sleepy sort of place, a one-trattoria town where women set out their chairs on the shady side of the street to sew in the afternoons. There are only a few dozen buildings, all of the same light brown stone. A little open space barely big enough to be called a piazza serves as a stage, and it is almost overwhelmed by the steeply tiered bleachers for about 500 people. **********Aldo Nisi, a retired teacher, is the president of the cooperative that puts on the plays. Sitting at a rough-hewn wooden table in his cool cellar, Mr. Nisi said: ''Actors are trained to invent roles, to tell what is not true and make it credible with fine skills. Here no one is really an actor because everyone is voicing his own ideas, his own feelings, and is using his own language.'' Actors Write Their Lines **********''Autodrama'' was the way Giorgio Strehler, one of Italy's most prominent theater directors, once described the Monticchiello theatricals. It is drama as a form of collective self-expression because each actor virtually writes his own lines during a long communal drafting process. Several roles, like a conniving matchmaker and a peasant wise man, appear in every play and are performed by the same actors each year. **********Exit Mr. Nisi to deal with carpenters and electricians. A tall bearded man with long curly hair enters the wine cellar. It is Andrea Cresti, Monticchiello's director. **********''We were having a hard time deciding what this year's play should be about until we heard about the dumping plan, and then it was easy,'' he said. **********As 10 or 20 people were gathered in the crypt of the 13th-century church last winter to discuss this year's play, word arrived that Monticchiello's valley of pastures and grain fields was being considered as site for the burial of toxic industrial wastes by the Tuscan regional government. **********''We decided to use the play to defend ourselves,'' said Mr. Cresti, ''but without simply turning it into a protest. We talked about it until spring, and by then we knew we did not want to be like all those places turning away that famous boat full of garbage. It is too comfortable to simply say, 'Not here.' '' An Ambiguous Resolution **********By April the Monticchiello players had hit on a formula, an allegorical fable about peasants who go to a witch for help in learning why their land is bearing strange fruit. Then a king and queen have a hard time determining whether the creature responsible for changing the land is a benefactor or a villain. The allegories are clear. The resolution is forthrightly ambiguous. **********''The play focuses on the moral ambivalence of man's relationship to the environment,'' said Mr. Cresti, 48 years old, who teaches business administration in a nearby town. ''It describes our schizophrenia when we feel that pollution is bad but cannot condemn the causes of pollution, automobiles and factories.'' **********The Poor Theater of Monticchiello, which always performs in the old dialect of the Tuscan countryside, was founded when the village was rapidly losing population as a result of mechanized agriculture and the lure of city jobs. Now many of the 300 villagers, especially the young people, commute to the many small factories that have sprung up along the main highway and rail line about 10 miles away. **********By law the Tuscan regional government was supposed to produce a plan in 1986 for the disposal of toxic wastes, 114,000 tons a year. A one-year extension was granted on the deadline because almost every spot in this blessed region can, like Monticchiello, claim special dispensations for reasons of natural or man-made beauty. A final decision is expected in winter, when the Monticchiello players will again be debating ways to express their ambiguities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/12/business/key-rates-318587.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/09/business/money-fund-assets-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Fund Assets Up", "print_headline": "Money Fund Assets Up", "body_text": " **********Assets of the nation's 398 money market mutual funds increased $1.82 billion, to $245.56 billion, in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.

'Opposed to Violence' **********''I told them if I smacked my kids on the hand, it hurts me, that's how opposed to violence I am,'' said Mrs. Maguire, who served her time on the strength of vowing some day to prove her family was innocent. It was a strength she was forced to find, she says, amid a shattering experience 11 years ago when the Maguires were allowed their first hourlong prison visit together after months apart. **********''To see little Patrick come in wearing prison clothes,'' she recalled, now back in north London where she cleans a bar to support the family. ''And the boys hugging me to show strength, when I could feel their hands shaking. And then Paddy crying, grabbing us all and asking, 'What's happened to you?' '' **********Paddy Maguire is a reticent, gray-haired man now, spending his days unemployed between the local bar and their public-housing apartment, where his wife plans each phase of the family's continuing campaign to be pronounced not terrorists but victims of injustice. **********An older friend and relative, Patrick Conlon, died in prison, accused of being a plotter in the case, and the years of her boys' childhood in detention without their mother was just as mortal a loss, she said firmly, recalling the prison time. 'The Strength of This Family' **********''I was going to go off my head, but something kept saying to me, 'You're the strength of this family.' I knew if I broke, the boys would break, go on a hunger strike and die, the family'd be lost.'' **********The mother and younger Maguires did not break. But the family remains as guilty as ever in the eyes of the law, found so in a jury trial, and they have served their full terms: the parents nine years and four months, the boys close to four years. But Annie Maguire's hope is running higher since the announcement that the Home Office would investigate the case. **********''England's our home and here we stay,'' she said. ''It will always be the Maguires' home, and this is why we have to fully clear our name.'' **********The unusual inquiry is based on new evidence submitted in the sensational 1975 bombings at two English bars frequented by British soldiers, at Guildford and Woolwich, in which seven people were killed. The explosions were part of an Irish Republican Army terror offensive in England, one that left civilians alarmed in the mid-1970's and Irish immigrants here anxious at the thought of being suspect. One Piece of Evidence **********The Maguires were arrested in their London home on the basis of a confession from a nephew in Belfast who later renounced it, insisting it had been beaten out of him. Their convictions rested on a single piece of controversial forensic testimony, the insistence by Government laboratory experts that the Maguires' hands bore traces of nitroglycerine. **********The guilty verdict came even though experts contradicted each other and the inventor of the test questioned its reliability, saying tobacco traces can produce the same result as explosives. The Government has since changed its evidence procedures to require that a different, more positive test be used to conclusively show traces of explosives. **********This was too late for the Maguires, but the details of how their convictions rested on this single piece of evidence have now been publicized in a book, ''Trial and Error,'' by Robert Kee. **********He is a longtime documentary journalist well-respected in Britain, particularly for a series several years ago that accomplished the seemingly impossible task of presenting a history on the English-Irish troubles that was well received by both sides. **********''Their bearing and constancy as a family are testimony to that true worth of human nature which makes it so necessary always to distinguish between right and wrong,'' Mr. Kee said of the Maguires, presenting an array of doubts about the convictions. Different Image of the Police **********In particular, he noted that the public climate toward police credibility may be less doubt-free than it was a decade ago, when the police were under intense pressure to make arrests in the bombings. The police have denied charges of having beaten confessions from Irish people in dragnet operations. **********Annie Maguire said it was belief in divine justice and in the expressions of support from sympathetic Englishmen, not the I.R.A.'s complaints of injustice, that had motivated her to make the family continue fighting. ''They're hurting their own people,'' she said of the I.R.A. ''I believe violence gets nobody anywhere.'' **********She said she built her resolve in prison by recalling old days in the care of an earlier Annie, her grandmother from the Clark clan who raised 15 children along Belfast's Falls Road, an increasingly depressed ghetto for the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland. **********''Us Belfast women are inclined to stand up and fight to the end if we know we're right,'' she said. **********This week the Maguires, hardly redeemed but still redoubtable, celebrated the first birthday of the family's newest Annie. She is a granddaughter, a strong crawler through the family apartment, a smiling blonde born to Anne-Marie, the daughter who was 9 years old and spared arrest when the rest of her family was taken away 12 years ago. **********''I thought about my granny,'' said the ranking Annie.

Yes, the envoy, William C. Bullitt, replied, he would like ''that lovely bluff overlooking the Moscow River'' for an embassy site. **********Stalin agreed, and so began what today may be the oldest unfinished business in Soviet-American relations. **********An embassy was eventually built, though far from the site Mr. Bullitt had requested. But critics now say that the building is too infested with electronic bugs to be usable. And in Washington, the Russians are barred by agreement from moving into their new embassy until the Americans move into theirs. **********Mr. Bullitt evidently sought the property on Lenin Hills - today the site of Moscow University and government guest lodges - for the panorama of Moscow. He hoped to build a residence patterned on Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's estate in Virginia. A History of Embassy Project The Ambassador is unlikely to have anticipated the technological advances in electronic espionage that would have made such a high site lucrative. This vignette is among several that emerge from a history of the embassy project prepared several years ago by Culver Gleysteen, a Foreign Service officer, now retired. **********One of the charges being aired in Washington is that the new Soviet Embassy there occupies high ground, while the American structure in Moscow is low. Mr. Gleysteen recalls not only that the Americans could have had the high site, but also that it was the State Department that pressed the reluctant Russians to take the high site in Washington. **********Mr. Gleysteen, who served three tours of duty in the Soviet Union between 1950 and 1974, prepared his study in 1978 out of concern that the roots of the embassy project were fading into obscurity. His conclusion at the time was that ''a mid-1982 completion date would seem optimistic.'' New Housing Already Occupied **********It proved optimistic, indeed. American diplomats began moving into new housing in the compound only last year. But the chancery is not ready for occupancy, and 52 years after Mr. Bullitt first cabled Washington that a new embassy was in the national interest and won appropriations for it, American diplomats still work out of their present cramped chancery in a leased building. **********In broad outline, the history of the project parallels the ups and downs of Soviet-American relations. The negotiations initiated by Ambassador Bullitt stalled and were revived only in the 1950's. **********In the meantime, the American Embassy first occupied a building next to the National Hotel looking toward Red Square. And in 1952, the United States accepted a Soviet offer of the present premises, a nine-story building on Tchaikovsky Street, which is a section of the Ring Road around central Moscow. The ambassador at the time, George F. Kennan, accepted the offer, Mr. Gleysteen writes, because the site was reasonably central and close to the ambassador's residence, Spaso House. Embassy Choice Is Called Poor The choice was probably a mistake, Mr. Gleysteen writes. The embassy quickly outgrew the building, and by the 1960's, he said, it ''had probably become the worst Foreign Service office building anywhere, certainly for any major post.'' **********In Washington, meanwhile, the Russians were also in the market for a new embassy. They had outgrown the building they inherited from the czarist period on 16th Street N.W. and were shopping for a bigger property. **********Their search met resistance from property owners who feared the effect of Communist neighbors on real estate values. **********A Soviet attempt to buy a property called Bonnie Brae in the Chevy Chase area ran into opposition from residents. A subsequent bid to buy an estate called Treganon in Cleveland Park, Mr. Gleysteen wrote, was opposed by J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director, who lived nearby. **********Finally, the State Department pressed the Russians to accept a Government-owned property on Wisconsin Avenue that had been vacated by the Veterans Administration. Mr. Gleysteen said intelligence agencies had no objection to locating the Soviet Embassy on the site, an elevation known as Mount Alto. Soviet Long Resisted Site Yet as late as 1971, the Soviet Embassy resisted the site, on the ground that it was distant from the center and hard to secure against harassment, like that of the Jewish Defense League. **********In Moscow, the Soviet Government offered the Americans a site behind the existing embassy that was slated for urban renewal. Though it has been described as a low-lying ''swamp,'' it is in fact no swampier than any other part of Moscow. **********The discussion of sites got under way in 1959 when Nikita S. Khrushchev came to the United States. **********But with the shooting down of the American U-2 spy plane, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the war in Vietnam, bureaucratic wrangling and disputes over the shape and value of lots, agreement was not reached until 10 years later. **********It called for matching 85-year leases, the Soviet Embassy for the 12.5-acre Mount Alto site, and the Americans for the 10-acre embassy site and the 1.8-acre plot of Spaso House. **********Then began even more involved negotiations over construction, ranging from importing construction materials to the duration of the lease, the height of the respective chanceries and control over the site during construction. Russians Hired U.S. Architect **********The Russians had a lesser problem, since they hired an American architect and an American construction concern. In the Soviet Union, the sole building contractor is the Soviet Government. **********In the end, Mr. Gleysteen said, the agreement gave the Russians control over basic construction, and the Americans control over plumbing, electrical and other finishing work - a noteworthy fact in light of recent complaints that the Russians imbedded their bugs into prefabricated concrete sections cast off-site. **********The agreement was finally signed in December 1974, Mr. Gleysteen wrote, ''39 years after Ambassador Bullitt took up the issue with Stalin and 13 years after the Soviet accepted our initiative to revive it.'' That was 12 years ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/01/business/l-equality-428587.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 270, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Equality", "print_headline": "Equality", "body_text": " **********To the Editor:  Attributing increased layoffs of black managers to this administration's policies (''The Ax Falls on Equal Opportunity,'' Jan. 4) completely misses the point.

John M. Poindexter's testimony supporting the President's account, a majority of Americans still say that President Reagan lied when he said he did not know that money from the Iran arms sales was channeled to the Nicaraguan rebels, a New York Times/CBS News Poll shows. **********A key reason appeared to be that nearly half of Americans said Admiral Poindexter was lying when he testified to the Congressional select committees on the Iran-contra affair that he had not told the President about the diversion of funds. **********The poll, which interviewed 665 adults nationwide by telephone on Thursday, also found that the credibility and popularity of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North gained sharply between the middle and the end of his testimony. #51 Percent Opposed Assistance But it showed little change in American sentiment toward providing military and other aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, a cause Colonel North promoted frequently in his televised testimony, with 51 percent opposed to such assistance by the United States Government, and 35 percent in favor. **********That is about the same as last week, although it represents a gain for the Administration's policy of supporting the rebels since an earlier Times/CBS News poll in January, when 60 percent said they were opposed and 28 percent said they approved. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points. **********Although the number of Americans who said Mr. Reagan is lying about his knowledge of the connection between the arms sales and aid to the contras remained about the same before and after Admiral Poindexter's testimony, the number of those who thought Mr. Reagan was telling the truth increased. **********In a New York Times/CBS News Poll a week earlier, 56 percent said Mr. Reagan was lying and 26 percent said he was telling the truth; this week, 53 percent still said he was lying but 34 percent said he was telling the truth. Mr. Reagan's overall job approval rating remained virtually unchanged, with 50 percent saying they approved of the way he was handling his job and 41 percent saying they disapproved. **********Of Admiral Poindexter's testimony that he did not tell Mr. Reagan about the diversion of funds, 47 percent said he was lying and 33 percent said he was telling the truth. Lied About What Reagan Knew **********Colonel North's credibility was considerably higher. Seventy-four percent said they believed that the colonel generally told the truth in his testimony, while only 15 percent said they thought he was generally lying. **********Some of those who said he generally told the truth asserted that he lied about some smaller matters so, in all, 45 percent said Colonel North had not been completely truthful. In another indication of the damage to Mr. Reagan's credibility, the lie they most often believed he had told was about what the President knew. **********The public also sided with Colonel North in his dispute with Robert C. McFarlane, who as national security adviser was the colonel's superior in 1984 and 1985, over whether Mr. McFarlane had authorized Colonel North's actions in aid of the Nicaraguan contras. Sixty percent said they believed Colonel North - who said he had taken no actions without authorization from his superiors - and 16 percent said they believed Mr. McFarlane. 'A Real Patriot' **********Overall, Colonel North continued to build a favorable impression in the public mind in his six days of testimony. Fifty-six percent of the public said they viewed him favorably (up from 43 percent last week) and 13 percent said they viewed him unfavorably, compared with 14 percent last week. **********By comparison, Admiral Poindexter was viewed favorably by 13 percent and unfavorably by 24 percent, and Mr. McFarlane was viewed favorably by 15 percent and unfavorably by 21 percent. **********Two days after his testimony ended, Colonel North was viewed as ''a real patriot'' by 73 percent of the public, up from 64 percent last week, although 56 continued to say that he ''went too far with his actions.'' And while 25 percent said they considered him a ''national hero,'' that was a gain from 18 percent last week. Support for Congress **********Congress also appears to be gaining in the public mind as the hearings continue. Despite fears by members of the Congressional select committees that they were being perceived as unduly harsh to Colonel North, 60 percent said they believed the Congressmen had treated him fairly, up from 49 percent a week ago. Twenty-one percent said the colonel had been treated too hard and 10 percent said the committees were too easy on him. **********Congress also was regarded overwhelmingly as a necessary element in the conduct of foreign policy. Sixty-one percent of the public rejected the idea that a President should be able to conduct secret operations in foreign countries without informing top Congressional leaders ''if he thinks it's necessary to do that,'' while only 34 percent said he should be able to do so. Comparison With Watergate **********The Congressional hearings continued to attract a high level of interest, according to the survey, with three-quarters of Americans reporting they were either very or somewhat interested in them, and more saying ''very'' than did a week ago. **********But at the same time, the severity with which the Iran-contra scandal is being viewed by the public appears to be diminishing as the hearings continue. **********The number of people who say that the Iran-contra matter is as serious as the Watergate scandal declined in the past week, to 40 percent from 47 percent, and the number who said it was not as serious increased, to 40 percent from 32 percent. The number volunteering that it was more serious remained about the same, at 11 percent, compared with 9 percent a week ago. Contrasting Results **********The Times/CBS News Poll found the public still opposed to ''military and other aid'' to the rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government, with 51 percent saying they disapproved of such aid and 35 percent approving. **********In the current survey, only a small number of people reported having changed their opinion on aid to the Nicaraguan rebels since the hearings began, with 29 percent saying they approved of aid to the contras before Colonel North testified and 54 percent saying they disapproved before that. **********This result contrasts with surveys taken in recent days by Richard B. Wirthlin, President Reagan's pollster, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post and ABC News. All of them reported a shift since the Congressional hearings began, finding the country now almost evenly split on the matter of United States military aid to the contras. Trouble Locating Nicaragua **********Asked which aspect of the Iran-contra matter was worse - the sale of the arms to Iran or the use of the profits from those sales to aid the Nicaraguan rebels - 47 percent said the arms sales were worse and 34 percent said that helping the contras was worse. **********Despite the discussion of Nicaragua in recent weeks, a substantial number of Americans had trouble describing in what part of the world Nicaragua was located. Thirty-two percent placed it correctly, saying it was in Central America or Latin America. Another 21 percent were close, calling it a part of South America. And another third admitted that they did not know. **********The remaining 15 percent placed Nicaragua in a wide variety of regions, with several placing it near Iran or Iraq, many in the Middle East, some in Africa, and a few in Asia or near Vietnam. One person said it was ''just below, I think, Texas.'' And another person described Nicaragua as ''south of the U.S. - and not very south.''

Overall results were very similar in the two polls. Those with no opinions are not shown.  HOW POLL WAS CONDUCTED **********The latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted July 16 with 665 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. **********The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences. **********The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephones and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education. **********In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 4 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans. The error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for women the sampling error is plus or minus 5 percentage points and for men it is plus or minus 6 percentage points. **********In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/22/business/company-news-irving-bank-bid-delayed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 277, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Irving Bank Bid Delayed", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Irving Bank Bid Delayed", "body_text": " **********The Federal Reserve has told the Bank of New York that the information in its application to acquire the Irving Bank Corporation was ''seriously deficient'' and gave the bank until next Thursday to provide additional data.

Refers to U.S.-Iran Deal **********The prosecutor, Pierre Baechlin, in a 20-minute statement that referred to the Iran arms sales and the resulting inquiries in the United States, asked for a maximum 10-year sentence for Mr. Abdallah. **********According to French law, Mr. Baechlin, whose request is seen here as reflecting the Government's view, could have asked for life imprisonment. **********Mr. Baechlin's request does not bind the court's panel of seven judges, who are expected to pronounce a verdict Saturday, but it is rare for a French court to impose a sentence longer than the one sought by the prosecutor. 'Agony in My Heart' **********''With agony in my heart, I have come to beseech you, to beg you, to ask you not to pronounce against the accused a sentence of more than 10 years,'' Mr. Baechlin said. **********''Every condemnation transforms the condemned person into a martyr to his own people and transforms France into a hostage,'' Mr. Baechlin went on. ''We are fighting against terrorism with ridiculous weapons. **********''Every night, like everybody else, I see the faces of French hostages in Lebanon. You must render a judgment that is in the interest of everybody.'' **********French legal specialists who are observing the trial have said that if Mr. Abdallah receives a 10-year sentence, he could be paroled within a year or two, given that he has already served nearly two and a half years in prison and that a part of his sentence is likely to be suspended. **********The trial, being attended every day by four American diplomats and officials, has from the beginning been surrounded by an intense atmosphere of speculation - fueled by reports in the press - that the French Government would seek a way of releasing Mr. Abdallah quickly, hoping that, in exchange, a rash of bomb attacks that terrorized France last year would not resume. **********Mr. Abdallah, who is believed to head a terror group calling itself the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction, is specifically accused of complicity in the murder of Charles Ray, an American military attache in Paris, and Jacov Barsimantov, a second secretary in the Israeli embassy. **********A group demanding Mr. Abdallah's release claimed responsibility for a series of five terror explosions in Paris last September that killed 10 people and wounded 162. The satirical weekly Canard Enchaine, which has a reputation for political exposes, reported two days ago that the French Government had been negotiating through Arab intermediaries to gain the release of a hostage, Jean-Louis Normandin, being held in Lebanon. The Government, according to the newspaper, has been told that a moderate sentence for Mr. Abdallah is a condition for the release. 'Small Flame of Hope' **********In his plea today, Mr. Baechlin seemed to make a reference to the disclosure in the newspaper, saying, ''We cannot extinguish the small flame of hope that has been lit in Lebanon during the last few days.'' **********Mr. Baechlin's comments followed a plea by Georges Kiejman, the lawyer representing the United States, who specifically asked the court to ignore what he called the Government's preferences in the case and to judge it solely on the basis of the ''judicial facts.'' Lenient Treatment Criticized **********''You do not have to enter into the machinery of the state,'' Mr. Kiejman said. ''Your duty is to render justice and not to render service.'' **********Mr. Kiejman, in a plea lasting more than 2 hours, told the court that lenient treatment of Mr. Abdallah would be a reward to terrorists. **********''I am aware that terror attacks can touch us and those close to us,'' he said. ''But we have to put an end to the belief of some terrorists that France has become a sanctuary for them.'' **********The Abdallah trial has been closely followed here, in part because of widespread concerns that a conviction of Mr. Abdallah would lead to a resumption of the terror bombings. The trial is also unusual because of the presence of the United States, represented by Mr. Kiejman, which decided last year to became a civil plaintiff against Mr. Abdallah to head off the possibility that the French Government might not try him at all. **********Addressing the American role, Mr. Baechlin, in his plea today, referred to the ''disarray'' in the United States caused by revelations that the Reagan Administration sold arms to Iran in an attempt to secure the release of American hostages in Lebanon. **********After Mr. Baechlin's plea, Mr. Abdallah's defense lawyer, Jacques Verges, said the dossier on Mr. Abdallah was ''empty.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/business/economic-anemia-in-europe.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1987-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1567, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ECONOMIC ANEMIA IN EUROPE", "print_headline": "ECONOMIC ANEMIA IN EUROPE", "body_text": " **********Western Europe's economy will grow at a disappointing rate through next year, economists predict, with the increase too weak to put a dent in Europe's stubbornly high 11 percent unemployment rate. **********Many economists voice frustration that even though inflation has been brought under control and corporate profits are strong, a number of negative factors, such as lackluster capital spending, will limit Europe's growth to just 2 percent this year and next. **********''Economic growth in Europe has been anemic,'' said Jean Cheval, chief economist for Banque Indosuez in Paris. ''Two percent is dismaying because it leaves unemployment at a very high level.'' 'Eurosclerosis' **********If Western Europe's growth is indeed just 2 percent next year, it will be the ninth straight year of growth below 3 percent for the region and its 400 million people. Western Europe has had double-digit unemployment since 1983, and its economy must grow by close to 3 percent a year for its jobless rate to start dropping. **********All this has left economists and government officials groping for a cure for what is being termed ''Eurosclerosis.'' **********Economists have suggested that the causes of this economic ailment include the influence of strong unions, government regulation of business, the general lack of an entrepreneurial culture and a preference for financial investments over capital investments. **********Leaders in France, Britain and elsewhere in Europe have responded by lowering taxes, fighting union demands and reducing regulation. Some economists said such moves would enable Europe's economic growth to average 2.5 percent a year in a few years, but they said growth would remain below that level for the next year or two because of the weak dollar and government efforts to maintain budget discipline. **********''Europe can be an economic engine for the world, but it won't be this year,'' said one economist with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a 24-nation group based in Paris. ''Europe has a lot of potential, but its policies are still kind of restrictive.'' A Recession Is Unlikely **********Even with Europe's slow-growth outlook, few economists predict it will fall into a recession this year or next. The only chance for a recession, forecasters say, is if oil prices soar or if the dollar plunges further, which would hurt European exports to the United States by making them more expensive. **********''If the dollar falls to 1.50 German marks by the end of this year, there could be a recession in Europe,'' said J. Paul Horne, an international economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in Paris. The dollar has fallen to just below 1.80 marks, from more than 3.20 marks in early 1986. **********One piece of good news is that Italy and Great Britain, long the laggards of Europe, have been able to escape the economic torpor. Both are expected to grow by 3 percent or more this year, although economists forecast they will grow by less than that next year because London and Rome are reining in their economies out of fear of burgeoning trade deficits and rising inflation. **********On the other hand, France and West Germany, Europe's two largest economies, are barely moving. With their Governments seeking to maintain budgetary discipline, the two nations are expected to grow by 1.5 percent or less this year. 'Rags and Riches' **********''The story in Europe this year seems to be rags and riches,'' said David M. Mars, European economist for S. G. Warburg Securities in London. ''Next year, everyone might be a little closer to one another in terms of growth.'' **********The O.E.C.D. predicts that Germany and France will grow by 2 percent next year, Britain by 2.25 percent and Italy by 2.5 percent. The O.E.C.D., which uses one of the world's most sophisticated economic computer models, forecast that Western Europe's overall economy will grow by 2 percent in both 1987 and 1988, with inflation running at 3.75 percent this year and 3.5 percent next year. **********Some forecasters, such as Geoffrey Horton of DRI Europe, are more optimistic and say Europe's economy will expand by 2.5 percent next year. Last December, the O.E.C.D. predicted that Europe's growth would be 2.5 percent this year and next, but it revised that forecast to 2 percent partly because the fall of the dollar has hurt Europe's exports more than expected. **********''Two percent growth doesn't look quite so bad when you remember that Europe is in the fifth year of an economic recovery,'' said Mr. Horne of Smith Barney. Focus on West Germany **********In comparison, the O.E.C.D. expects the United States to grow by 2.5 percent this year and 2.75 percent next year, which does not appear to be much better than the projections for Europe. Nevertheless, the recovery of the United States from the 1981-82 recession has been markedly stronger than Europe's and its unemployment rate has fallen to 6 percent. **********Many economists think the key to faster growth in Europe is getting West Germany, which has a small budget deficit and almost no inflation, to stimulate its economy, especially its domestic demand. Devastated by the plunge of the dollar and a bitterly cold winter, West Germany's economy declined in the first quarter before rebounding moderately in the second quarter. **********If West Germany grows faster, its people will in theory demand more goods from other European countries. That process could also benefit the United States, which has urged West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies in the hope that the demand for American products would increase and the American trade deficit would decline. **********Backed strongly by Washington, the O.E.C.D. has urged West Germany to bolster its economy by lowering taxes and increasing its budget deficit. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been reluctant to cut taxes more than the reduction of 14 million marks already scheduled for 1988 because of resistance from leaders of the German states, who worry about losing revenues from Bonn. **********''The Germans don't want to play the role of locomotive of Europe,'' said Mr. Cheval of Banque Indosuez. ''They don't want to increase their deficit. They are always scared of rekindling inflation.'' Devaluations Possible **********Though West Germany's economy may have caught a cold last winter, France's and Italy's economies were more vigorous. One result was that French and Italian consumers and companies imported so many goods from West Germany - which had a trade surplus of $57 billion last year - that those two nations developed a huge trade deficit with the Federal Republic. **********Mr. Mars of Warburg Securities predicted that Italy's new Government would push later this year to change the European Monetary System so that the lira would be devalued against the West German mark. In addition, many analysts say the French Government will move to devalue the franc against the mark. But, knowing that devaluations are embarrassing, Paris is not expected to act until after next spring's presidential elections. **********Mr. Cheval of Indosuez predicts that the French economy should pick up steadily because its trade deficit has been improving in the second half and real wages are rising more slowly than in most nations. **********''France is the slow man, not the sick man, of Europe,'' Mr. Cheval said. Italy Tries to Slow Down **********Italy, with its flashy entrepreneurs and industrial empires, has been the fast man, but it apparently needs to slow down to catch its breath. In recent months, Italian officials have become worried about a large budget deficit, rising inflation and a worsening trade balance. **********On Aug. 28, the Italian Government announced it would raise its bank discount rate as well as taxes on consumer goods and gasoline. These moves are likely to help reduce Italy's 1988 growth to less than this year's levels. **********Like Italy, Britain has also had some worries about an overheated economy, with the inflation rate above 4 percent and imports outstripping exports. London preceded Italy in raising interest rates to slow down its economy. **********Britain has been one of Europe's fastest-growing economies thanks to the boom in London's financial markets, the pound's 15 percent drop last year against most European currencies and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's moves to reduce taxes and regulations. Higher Rates Criticized **********Worries about overheated economies are warranted, many economists say, because the factory capacity utilization rates in several countries are approaching their former peaks. But many economists criticize the remedy used - higher interest rates - which will slow growth at a time when in their view, more growth is needed to help Europe's 19 million unemployed. **********Juergen Donges, vice president of the Institute of World Economics in Kiel, West Germany, said high interest rates often ''encourage companies to invest in risk-free financial investments rather than in new plant and equipment with the risks of strikes and other problems.'' **********Philippe Sigogne, the director of the French Institute of Economic Analysis, added, ''With the low costs of raw materials nowadays and with capacity utilization rates fairly high, business should be doing more to increase its capital investment.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/05/business/about-real-estate-a-florist-starts-a-brooklyn-renovation.html": {"writer_name": "Lisa Foderaro", "pub_date": "1987-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 886, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A FLORIST STARTS A BROOKLYN RENOVATION", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE; A FLORIST STARTS A BROOKLYN RENOVATION", "body_text": " **********For the last 25 years Martin J. Orlofsky has sold chrysanthemums and gladiolus in his flower shop in downtown Brooklyn, at the corner of Fourth and Flatbush Avenues, while the area around him has ridden an economic roller coaster. **********When he founded the family business in 1949 - his shop at that time was a block away - the downtown area was a ''triple A'' retail center, ''the Times Square of Brooklyn,'' Mr. Orlofsky said. Later, he remembers, John V. Lindsay, while running for Mayor, used photographs of the same section to depict the dangers of urban decay. **********Now downtown Brooklyn is bouncing back, with the help of the impending mixed-use Atlantic Terminal redevelopment project as well as other commercial and residential buildings planned or under construction. And Mr. Orlofsky has become part of that revival as the converter of the vacant 10-building complex -in which his store, Midtown Florist, is situated - into 39 rental apartments. **********''I've had a million opportunities to go into real estate, and I always said, 'Look, I'm in the flower business,' '' said Mr. Orlofsky, 62 years old, taking a recent break in the back office at his store, where flies buzzed, a fan stirred the humidity and one of his six sons ordered flowers over the phone. ''But this was different. This affected my business.'' **********He was referring to an auction by the city early in this decade of the adjoining brick apartment buildings, which date from the late 1800's. Mr. Orlofsky, competing against experienced developers, won the one-acre property for $325,000. **********Then, as now, Midtown Florist was the sole tenant - either retail or residential - in the dilapidated V-shaped complex, which measures 70,800 square feet and rises four stories at one of the busiest and most visible intersections in downtown Brooklyn. **********The structure, whose $6 million conversion was designed by Leonard Colchamiro, a Brooklyn architect with a 10 percent interest in the development, is still, after a year of construction, a windowless brick shell. But the cornices and lintels have been restored, the innards gutted and the few crumbling walls rebuilt. **********By early fall, residents should begin moving into the relatively spacious apartments, which will consist of 20 two-bedroom duplexes, measuring 1,000 square feet; 18 two-bedroom floor-throughs, also 1,000 square feet, and one studio of 550 square feet. The rents are expected to range from $1,100 to $1,300 for the two-bedrooms, while the studio will lease for about $750. **********Midtown Florist, which has a staff of 70 and revenues of $4 million a year, will expand by 3,000 square feet. Some 11,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor will be renovated and leased to nine stores for about $35 a square foot. **********The apartment complex, to be called Times Plaza, was designed so that all tenants will go through one lobby in a building on State Street, the only residential street bounding the site. There, a wide staircase will lead to a private 6,000-square-foot landscaped plaza, nestled behind the buildings, from which tenants will gain access to their apartments. **********To help shield residents from the frequent sirens, extra thick windows will be installed. In addition, sprinkler systems will be hooked up in every building. Mr. Orlofsky, who lives in Merrick, L.I., with his wife, Stella, said he planned to turn the building into a cooperative in five or six years. **********Mr. Orlofsky's young career as a developer - it has left his wife and three of his sons in charge of the flower shop - will not end here. Behind the rental apartments, which occupy a half-acre, the other half of the property now functions as a parking lot and a storage area for building materials. Construction will begin there in January on a four- to six-story building that will contain about 40 condominiums. Prices for the units, scheduled for occupancy in early 1989, have not been set yet, **********Financing for the rental project, in the form of a $4.5 million construction loan, came from the Community Preservation Corporation, a special lender that, with the backing of 32 city banks, provides mortgages for the rehabilitation of housing in aging New York regions. **********''The Times Plaza buildings,'' said Mary Brennan, a vice president at the corporation, ''should break the ground for the neighborhood's revitalization, leading other developers to build in the Fort Greene area.'' **********That kind of real estate contagion is already palpable. Several speculators and two major developers have sought an interest in Mr. Orlofsky's project. One, shortly before the financing came through, offered to reimburse him for funds already spent on the development and add another $5 million for control of the site. The florist said no. ''Sure, I want to turn a profit - the bottom line is always important,'' said Mr. Orlofsky, who has 18 grandchildren. ''But this is a labor of love. I'm so proud of how we restored these buildings. This is my baby.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/21/world/100000-rally-for-punjab-politicians.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 252, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "100,000 Rally For Punjab Politicians", "print_headline": "100,000 Rally For Punjab Politicians", "body_text": " **********More than 100,000 Sikhs rallied in the state of Punjab today in support of secular political leaders who face a challenge from religious figures for leadership of India's Sikhs. **********At the rally, in Longowal in the southern Punjab, the Sikhs expressed faith in the leadership of the state's Chief Minister, Surjit Singh Barnala, and rejected a recent move by the Hindu sect's five head priests to excommunicate Mr. Barnala for refusing to obey their directives. **********The priests, who took office a few weeks ago, are allied with factions that favor secession from India.

Rise in Exports Cited **********Analysts said the big July increase showed that American industry was recovering from two years of sluggishness caused by high foreign trade deficits. They gave credit for the upturn to a rise in American exports. In a separate report, the Government said that exports increased in June but that the trade deficit grew to an apparent record of $15.7 billion because of a huge rise in imports. **********July's increase in industrial output was the largest since a gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent in April 1986, and pushed the increase in production for the past 12 months to 3.9 percent. **********''The industrial output figures are bigger than I thought they would be,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist for Bear, Stearns & Company of New York. ''They are another signal of the strength of the economy.'' **********But Maury Harris, chief economist for Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said the sharp rise might overstate the strength in the industrial sector. Production figures are based in part on employment data gathered by the Labor Department. Mr. Harris said that July's increase in manufacturing employment was inflated by faulty seasonal adjustments. **********The gain in July production reflected in part a 2.2 percent rise in output at auto plants, the result of gains in vans and light trucks, which offset a drop in passenger cars. Auto production fell to an annual rate of 6.7 million units, down from 6.9 million in June. Mine Output Climbs **********Other strength in July came from a 1.1 percent rise in mine output, reflecting increases in metal mining and coal production, as well as a gain in oil and gas activity. **********Production in manufacturing rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in July following an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent in June.

Downey, a Long Island Democrat, also pressed Soviet officials in Moscow about the radar. **********Mr. Downey and the N.R.D.C. eventually joined forces in a weeklong trip to the Soviet Union to pursue a variety of arms-control issues; the visit culminated in the Krasnoyarsk tour. Not a Sure Thing **********Despite such positive forces and factors, the visit was far from a sure thing. Dr. Yevgeni P. Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and leader of the Soviet group that accompanied the American delegation to the radar, said on the way to the site that he initially had believed that the chances of a visit were only 5 to 10 percent. **********On one technical level, the Russians had little to lose since top-secret photos from American spy satellites had already raised many questions about the radar's purpose. Spotted from space more than four years ago, the radar is clearly pointed northeast - a direction well suited for tracking enemy warheads and less than optimal for tracking satellites, the rationale offered by the Soviet Union. **********For years, the Pentagon has said that the Krasnoyarsk site violates a prohibition in the ABM treaty against deploying high-powered, early warning radars anywhere except along a nation's periphery. **********This criticism escalated in April, when the first space photos of Krasnoyarsk, taken by a French civilian satellite, were released publicly. Private military experts quickly used these images to confirm the Pentagon's judgment - that the radar was pointed northeast and was thus a probable violation of the ABM treaty. Visit Lessened Fears **********What the recent inspection did was to lessen the West's worst fears about the site. The Reagan Administration has charged that the radar is intended to track incoming enemy warheads, at the very least for early warning of nuclear attack, and possibly for help in waging defensive wars meant to destroy enemy missiles and warheads, an ABM application known as battle management. Either use would violate the ABM treaty. **********But inspection showed the site to be half-built and shoddy, with no apparent future as a hardened bunker for waging antimissile wars. At best, it might someday be a humdrum early warning radar with some limited satellite-tracking capability. **********One of Moscow's potential losses in the visit involved the breach of military secrecy. A major goal of hiding what seem like mundane facts about military hardware is to deny potential foes firm knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of a nation's war machine, thus increasing doubts over whether aggression could be successful. **********In an unusual break with such principles, the American delegation that toured the site was allowed to take more than 1,000 photos inside and outside the giant radar, many of which will undoubtedly be subject to detailed analysis by the Pentagon. Moreover, that flood of information could reveal a kind of blueprint to many other Soviet installations since the Krasnoyarsk radar is similar to several so-called ''phased-array'' radars under construction in the Soviet Union. Erosion of ABM **********Even so, having seized the initiative by opening the site to foreigners, the Soviet Union now stands ready to score more political points than it ever could with its previous posture of stony silence and vehement denial. **********Most importantly, increased candor over Krasnoyarsk seems to bespeak a desire to stop the erosion of the ABM treaty, ostensibly a long-term Soviet goal based on its opposition to President Reagan's ''Star Wars'' antimissile program. **********It also stands to strengthen the hand of House liberals like Mr. Downey, who have promoted a number of arms-control measures over the objections of the Reagan Administration. Votes on many of these measures will soon be pending, including limits on nuclear testing, antisatellite weapons and ''Star Wars'' spending. The fate of these initiatives on Capitol Hill may well be influenced by the new show of Soviet openness."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/04/business/the-ax-falls-on-equal-opportunity.html": {"writer_name": "Claudia Deutsch", "pub_date": "1987-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3559, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE AX FALLS ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITY", "print_headline": "THE AX FALLS ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITY", "body_text": " **********IT seemed like a great idea last October, when the subject first came up. Black Agency Executives, an association of black directors of social service agencies in New York City, would invite about 60 black corporate executives of major national companies to a conference in April. The talk would be of fund raising, of board memberships, of management techniques, of all kinds of subjects on which the two groups could offer mutual assistance. **********The idea has since been scuttled. ''The ranks of blacks in corporations have been so decimated there just wouldn't be enough people to come,'' says John N. Odom, B.A.E.'s director. **********Across the country, black managers have been losing their jobs at an accelerated pace. Executive recruiters report that resumes from discharged black managers are flooding their offices, while assignments to recruit them - or anyone at the middle management level - are few and far between. **********So far, black engineers, sales managers and others in jobs that deal directly with products have been spared. And most experts say that lower-level black workers, many of whom are in unions, have fared no worse than their white counterparts in the wave of firings sweeping the country. **********But blacks in public affairs, community relations, human resources - all of the staff-support areas that have become havens for blacks and women trying to make it into the mainstream of corporate America - are finding their jobs, and their paychecks, gone. ''For years, blacks and women were steered into jobs that were not central to the organization,'' said Mary Anne Devanna, research director at the Columbia Business School's Management Institute. ''Now these are precisely the jobs that are being eliminated.'' **********Members of an increasingly angry black managerial community feel the dismissals have dealt them a one-two punch. They see themselves and their colleagues, far more than white women, back at square one in their careers, often after decades of employment with the same company. And since many of the fired managers were responsible for recruiting and guiding entry-level blacks through the corporate shoals, they say the trend bodes extremely ill for younger black would-be managers. **********''The whole country has gone backwards in the sense of equal opportunity,'' said Sheila Clark, 38, a black single parent who last month lost her job as director of career development at CBS Inc. ''It's like a door opened and suddenly it shut in your face.'' **********Although the corporate ax is falling on managers of all colors and races, black executives say it has fallen disproportionately hard on them as a group. According to David L. Vaughn, president of the National Urban Affairs Council, the number of executive jobs in the New York metropolitan area has shrunk by about 9 percent in the last couple of years. Well over half of the jobs that were eliminated, he says, had been held by blacks - a percentage that far exceeds black representation in managerial jobs. **********Other black executives cite similar figures. ''Mergers and acquisitions have cut the legs out of the movement of blacks in the corporate world,'' says Sullivan Robinson, head of Associated Black Charities, a 59-member federation of New York social services agencies. ''Corporate America has made a decision to whiten up again. It can't be coincidental. The numbers are just too extreme.'' **********Although specific numbers are impossible to unearth, most employment experts say it is because of weak information-gathering methods, not because the figures are wrong. ''We have little information about what's happening in specific occupations and little information about minorities, so hard data related to both are really hard to come by,'' explains Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********But calls to several universities, management associations, and executive search firms turned up a widespread perception of a vicious cycle: Black executives are often promoted to head Equal Employment Opportunity compliance and other minority-related areas, and because these jobs have little immediate impact on corporate bottom lines, they are the first to go in any cutback. ''Companies wind up so worried about quarterly profits that they cut out not only fat but fundamentally important social commitments,'' says James A. F. Stoner, professor of management at Fordham University's Graduate School of Business. **********The pressure seems to be off from Washington. Many companies report that inspections by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, a major enforcement arm for anti-discrimination regulations, are far less thorough than they were in previous Administrations, and that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is not living up to its rules. **********Clarence Thomas, chairman of the E.E.O.C., insists that ''the facts belie any such statements'' and that this year his agency filed a record number of lawsuits and class actions on behalf of individuals who charged discrimination. **********But blatant discrimination is not the issue in American business today, most blacks contend. And business experts tend to agree more with the perceptions of the black community than with the E.E.O.C. ''Politically, there is no longer a guardian angel for affirmative action,'' said Paul Hirsch, a professor at the University of Chicago. **********Newly unemployed blacks are more blunt. ''There's a consensus that E.E.O. was never really a part of the corporation, just something that had to be done under a different Administration,'' said Joseph E. Burgess, 51, a former assistant vice president of human resources at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company who was, in his words, ''reorganized out of a job'' in February. IN A sense, corporations can argue a degree of color-blindness in their widespread staff cuts. The huge number of mergers in recent years has meant wholesale elimination of duplicate jobs of all types, along the theory that no company needs two controllers or two heads of investor relations. **********At the same time, manufacturing companies are facing an unprecedented flood of low-priced import competition, and have been slashing their payrolls in an attempt to get costs low enough so that they can compete effectively. Airlines, telecommunications companies, and other companies operating in newly deregulated environments are finding unfamiliar price competition threatening their existence if they do not get costs down. **********The fickleness of management theory has also had a deleterious impact on staff jobs, including E.E.O.-type positions. In the last decade, management consultants, professors and other self-styled experts preached the virtues of formal strategic planning, psychologically oriented training programs, internal consulting groups, and other staff support functions. Corporations listened and acted accordingly, with the result that these staff jobs flourished in number and salary. **********Now, though, theories along the lines of those espoused by Thomas J. Peters and Robert H. Waterman Jr. in the best-selling ''In Search of Excellence'' have glorified companies with super-lean headquarters staffs and with decision-making done by the line managers, the people who actually run the manufacturing operations or market the products. **********The overall result has been a nationwide downsizing of corporate staffs, usually described as trimming the fat from management. And, black executives charge, it is their jobs that are most often classified as ''fat.'' **********Although corporations will not give specific numbers, they deny this. ''It is absolutely true that American companies are slimming down and cutting costs,'' said Ford Slater, manager of special issues, planning and communications for the General Electric Company. G.E., he says, reduced its overall payroll by 100,000 people - 25 percent of its work force - from 1981 to 1985. **********Mr. Slater insists that ''while the total number of G.E. managers and professionals has declined, the percentage of minorities and women in those categories has stayed about the same, or even increased.'' He predicts that G.E.'s acquisition of RCA -at $6.28 billion, the largest non-oil merger in history - will not have a disproportionate effect on black executives, either. **********James C. Doyle, Met Life's vice president of employee relations, also bridles at any suggestion that the company might treat blacks more shabbily than whites. ''The line managers have taken over the routine work of E.E.O. They prepare their own affirmative action plans and do their own contact with the Government agencies checking compliance,'' he said. ''So we've been able to eliminate supervisory layers at headquarters. But we've had no change in the percentage of minorities that are managers.'' **********Even companies that have publicly announced plans for sizable slim-downs say that blacks need not be disproportionately alarmed. ''Our cutbacks will show no lessening of commitment to affirmative action, E.E.O. or any of these areas,'' says a spokesman for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which announced on Dec. 18 that it would cut 27,400 jobs. BUT black leaders and academics seem unconvinced by corporate protestations. Though few cite instances of blatant discrimination, or even of a ''last in, first out'' approach to firing black executives, they say that for the past 20 years, educated, articulate blacks have been steered into jobs in which they deal primarily with minority issues. And they say that the Reagan Administration's lack of emphasis on monitoring compliance with the E.E.O.C.'s antidiscrimination rules, has enabled companies to cut those jobs with little fear of repercussions. **********''Some corporations are still somewhat dedicated to helping minorities, but there is no push from the Government compared to what it once was,'' said Ernest A. Richardson, a 61-year-old black consultant who two years ago left a 20-year career with the St. Regis Corporation after he and Champion International, the company that took over St. Regis, reached what he calls a ''happy understanding'' that the affirmative action programs that he ran would be pushed down to the branches. **********Mr. Richardson was not fired, and he says his consulting company is doing quite well. Still, in one way he is typical of black executives who are paying a high price for career decisions that, they say, white-dominated corporations strongly urged them to make years ago. Mr. Richardson's degree is in accounting. It was at St. Regis's suggestion that he switched his career to minority relations. **********That story is repeated again and again among black professionals, says Mr. Vaughn of the Urban Affairs Council. ''Throughout the 1970's, black people, even those with engineering degrees, were lured into managing affirmative action programs and the like,'' he says. ''They were told this was a way to get a foot in the door, they can switch over later. But the fact is, there is no mobility of blacks in corporate America today.'' **********For a time, blacks had reason to believe that these jobs represented their best shots at the top. ''In most companies, the first black to get a vice presidential position was within the human resources sector,'' said Ronald Anderson, director of minority relations at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. ''So many blacks felt this was a place where you could really rocket off. They didn't realize it had become a black managerial ghetto, that these jobs, with their great salaries, would hurt their careers down the road.'' **********Other blacks readily gave up line jobs to take an active role in E.E.O. James Nixon, whose job as director of ITT's equal opportunity operations ended with the New Year, started off as a nuclear engineer with another company, G.E. In the mid-1960's, G.E. asked him to be part of a nationwide effort to study its E.E.O. programs. ''I recommended that they have a headquarters organization for this, and they agreed,'' the 53-year-old executive recalled. ''So I became the head of E.E.O.'' **********G.E., Mr. Nixon says, made no attempt to stereotype him. In fact, in 1973 he moved out of E.E.O. and became a sales manager for G.E. in Detroit. But he, too, wound up back in E.E.O. work, when ITT, the giant telecommunications conglomerate, lured him away from G.E. with offers of high status and big bucks. ''ITT decided to upgrade its E.E.O. effort,'' he said. ''They made me an offer I couldn't refuse.'' **********Since then, Mr. Nixon has seen his E.E.O. department at ITT reduced from 18 people to 6 and now, to none. But much of that interim reduction, he says, was a result of increased automation and productivity on his staff's part. **********In any event, he is philosophical rather than bitter about how his career turned out. ''My attitude is, I play the game and I play it well, and when the game is over I look for another game,'' he says. ''The saying is, 'When white America gets a cold, blacks get pneumonia.' But we fought our way into this managerial group. What makes us think we're immune to its problems?'' **********But Mr. Nixon's attitude is not a typical one within the black community, or among black managers at ITT. Harold Anderson, who is now in his mid-40's, was with ITT for 15 years, most recently as manager of public affairs. A few months ago, when he realized he was likely to lose his job, he left the company to join the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem at a considerable cut in salary. **********''I was about to become the only male head of household to be cut in my department,'' Mr. Anderson said. Was this because he is black? ''I don't want to think that about ITT, but I have a suspicion. For a while, Federal statutes for E.E.O. kept minorities a pretty protected class at ITT, but with the Reagan Administration's de-emphasis of E.E.O., ITT no longer saw fit to make this a special group to protect.'' **********ITT calls that supposition ridiculous. ''If it was Harold's perception that any group was treated as a special group to protect, he is wrong,'' said James P. Gallagher, director of public relations, who headed the department Mr. Anderson worked for. ''We had a percentage by which we had to reduce head count. I told Harold that his responsibilities would no longer be handled by this department. I've recently had to tell four or five white people the same thing.'' **********Those fired blacks who are still pounding the pavements are finding it hard to give corporate America the benefit of the doubt. They are particularly angry about what they see as unfair stereotyping of their skills. ''God forbid you say you had anything to do with women or minorities, you're told that's passe,'' said Ms. Clark of CBS, who has an M.B.A. in human resources. ''When you say that's not your entire background, they don't want to hear it. If you're black they think you can't do anything but affirmative action.'' Mr. Burgess of Met Life, who also has a master's degree in human resources and development and is an elected member of the Yonkers City Council, has similar complaints. ''We E.E.O. professionals are recruiters, consultants, and career counselors, and we know corporate chemistry maybe better than anyone else in the company,'' he said. ''But these skills are not considered transferable in the case of blacks. They look at us and say, 'You're just an E.E.O. person.' '' THE answer for a growing number of middle-aged corporate blacks is to start their own companies. Mr. Nixon's employment contract still has a few years to run, so he could stay with ITT if he wished. He doesn't wish - instead, he is taking a lump sum and starting a consulting/ venture capital company aimed at helping other blacks start their own businesses. ''I've been preaching for 11 years that blacks have to get into entrepreneurship,'' he said. ''So I'm going to help them do it.'' **********Many younger blacks still have their sights set on the corporate world. But they are far less likely, experts say, to try to rise through the personnel or public affairs route. ''Blacks coming out of business schools have recognized that this is a trap and are saying they want nuts-and-bolts experience,'' said Mr. Anderson of the University of Chicago. **********Some companies say they would welcome an infusion of minority talent into their technical ranks. ''We are terribly concerned about the future source of brilliant engineers and scientists, and we recognize that one of the great untapped pools is women and minorities,'' said Mr. Slater of G.E., who adds that his company awards scholarships to promising minority students and subsidizes the salaries of black engineering and science teachers. **********Black executives themselves also express some well-tempered optimism. ''The good news is that blacks are being recruited into mainline positions, but the bad news is that it is very slow,'' says Mr. Anderson. Added Mr. Richardson, the former St. Regis manager: ''There will never be a return to what affirmative action and E.E.O. once was, but if you have it and you really believe in yourself, you're going to make it - if not to chairman of the board, into upper management.'' **********Academics say the prognosis may be even better than that. ''If you think of equity and efficiency as major concerns in corporations, and you think of a pendulum swinging between the two, you realize that what is happening now is that the pendulum is swinging toward efficiency,'' said George Milkovich, a professor of human resources at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. ''But the concern for equity will come back.'' **********If corporations do not give blacks parity, society will force them to, Mr. Milkovich adds. ''Neither labor law nor civil rights happened in a vacuum,'' he said. ''Society reacts, and politicians react to societal pressure. And nothing rivets corporate attention like the threat of a $40 million lawsuit or fine.''  BLACK FUNDRAISERS GO BACK TO SQUARE ONE **********Ask Sullivan Robinson, head of Associated Black Charities, what fund raising is like these days, and her frustration almost overwhelms the questioner. ''This February, we're introducing a Black History Makers award, and I need corporate underwriting,'' she says. ''I went to call my old mainstays. What happened? I learned that Richard Neblett, who was in charge of corporate contributions at Exxon, had been fast-tracked to retirement. The black man who had handled contributions at Chase Manhattan was doing something else. Wesley Streeter, my main contact at RCA, is gone.'' **********The downsizing of headquarters staffs and the wholesale elimination of entire job categories typically filled by blacks have had repercussions far beyond the world of black executives. Directors of charitable organizations and social service programs aimed at the black community are finding that some of their best fund-raising contacts are no longer on the scene. The result, they say, is that when corporations re-evaluate their charitable contributions, black charities often do not make it past the first cut. **********''In the late 60's and early 70's, corporations were really helpful in terms of funding to social services agencies,'' said John N. Odom, director of Black Agency Executives, an association of black directors of social service agencies in New York City. ''But now, organizations like ballet groups and art museums are doing better than they have in the past, while social services, particularly for minorities, are doing worse.'' **********Black charities have been among numerous sufferers in the tightening of charitable purse strings in corporations. ITT, for example, has eliminated a program for funding athletics for black youths. In fact, Harold Anderson, who had been liaison for that and similar programs, has been let go. **********But the company insists that his continued presence would have made little difference. The reason: ITT's much-publicized telecommunications joint venture with France has meant that revenues flowing directly to the corporation will be appreciably cut. ''We've always made contributions as a percentage of sales, and we're eliminating about $6 billion in sales through the joint venture,'' said James P. Gallagher, director of public relations. ''So we've cut back on contributions programs across the board, black and white.'' **********Similarly, General Electric executives insist that the merger with RCA, and resulting staff cutbacks, will not have a disproportionate impact on black charities. ''I would expect that the grand total of charitable contributions for RCA plus G.E. would be down somewhat next year from 1986, but minority-related contributions might actually go up as a percent,'' said Ford Slater, G.E.'s manager of special issues, planning and communications. **********But even if the overall flow of corporate dollars to the black community remains sizable, it will represent cold comfort to individual fund raisers. Most have spent countless hours maintaining contacts with specific individuals in large corporations so that, when those companies choose from the myriad causes needing financial support, their names are likely to be high on the list. ''I now have to find new liaisons, establish new rapports,'' says Ms. Robinson. ''And that takes years.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/18/business/advertising-beta-carotene-ads-by-smith-greenland.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 199, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beta Carotene Ads By Smith/Greenland", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Beta Carotene Ads By Smith/Greenland", "body_text": " **********Hoffmann-LaRoche has begun a multimillion-dollar ad campaign through Smith/Greenland to educate the public to the benefits of beta carotene, the food substance from green leafy vegetables and orange vegetables the consumption of which seems to cut down on the incidence of cancer. **********The pharmaceutical company is calling it a public-service campaign, but it does manufacture beta carotene for the pharmaceutical industry. **********The first ad in the campaign has the headline ''Beta Carotene just another health fad?

It was a natural thing to do: The steep valley walls were loaded with iron ore, and the old Venetian Republic often went to war. **********Weapons are still the major product here, because traditions die hard in families like the Berettas. Having almost certainly armed the Venetian sailors that defeated the Turkish fleet at Lepanto in 1571, the Berettas are now supplying the Pentagon with handguns to replace the legendary Colt .45. **********The Berettas claim to be the world's oldest industrial dynasty. Indeed, a document in the Venetian state archives shows that on October 3, 1521, the Republic's arsenal paid Master Bartolomeo Beretta 296 ducats for 185 harquebus barrels (a harquebus was an early version of a portable gun). The company's senior management can be traced in a continuous line through 13 generations back to Master Bartolomeo. **********Like some other family businesses in Italy, Beretta has mixed conservative business practices with innovation in design and manufacturing techniques. As a result, the company is neither very big nor immensely profitable. But it survives - and occasionally prospers - by concentrating on one kind of product and insuring that at least a few of its guns are the best that money can buy. **********''Certain lessons have been handed down over all these years,'' said Ugo Gussalli Beretta, the clan's current leader. ''We have developed an understanding of quality, and we have learned how to make progress sweetly, always on a steady course, not with big, quick steps.'' **********This kind of strategy can have its drawbacks. Last year, Beretta's Italian operations scored a net profit of about $1 million, down about 20 percent from 1985 and less than 1 percent of total sales. **********Mr. Beretta ascribes the poor performance to several factors. The dollar's drop has made the company's best-quality guns extremely expensive in America. The global market in hunting guns has been flooded by cheaper, less deluxe models. The Italian market has dropped by 30 percent over the past few years as the Government places increasingly severe restrictions on hunting in the face of depleted game. **********''The Bourse might be a bit impatient with us,'' Mr. Beretta said, ''but when shareholders are primarily relatives you have a certain stability because they are ready to make sacrifices.'' Relatives own 64 percent of Beretta's stock - the rest was sold 15 years ago to the Fabrique Nacional de Liege, a Belgian arms company, to raise capital and protect against takeover attempts. **********The company remains committed to making high-quality rifles and shotguns for hunting. ''We will continue doing what we do best,'' said Mr. Beretta, ''and the market factors will turn themselves around - they always have.'' The market for hunting guns had just about disappeared in America about 15 years ago, he points out, but game-management policies as well as social and political changes reversed that trend. **********CERTAIN family traditions help the Berettas avoid some of the pitfalls of family-run operations. The business is not run democratically. ''There has always been a 'capo' whose word was final,'' Mr. Beretta said. And the rule of primogeniture has never been applied: First-born sons have been passed over several times in favor of more qualified younger siblings. Ugo Beretta's 80-year-old uncle, Giuseppe, is president of the company, though he is virtually in retirement, and about 20 family members hold jobs at Beretta. **********But family tradition has not prevented innovation at the factory that produces 250,000 guns a year from a sprawl of buildings on either side of a rocky stream here. Beretta leads the industry in experimenting with the uses of aluminium alloys in gun parts, for example. **********The modern methods, though, are balanced by a long-term view. ''Signor Ugo,'' as Mr. Beretta is known, never ignores the lessons of history. ''Weapons companies have always been prime candidates for nationalization,'' he said. ''Right now the government favors the private sector, but who knows about 10 or 50 or 100 years from now?'' **********He is cautious about military sales generally. The Pentagon's 1984 decision to buy 320,000 Beretta 92SB-F 9-millimeter pistols for use as a standard sidearm produced a pile of exceptional publicity for Beretta (which also supplies the Texas Rangers.) But over all, Beretta is keeping the military side of the business to 20 to 30 percent of sales, as it has been for several years. **********Mr. Beretta, a dapper but strongly built man, says that is because the arms market is unpredictable. Indeed, Congress decided in 1986 that when the contract is completed in three years, the Pentagon will have to test a range of sidearms - as it did in 1984 - before continuing to buy the Beretta. **********Beretta's careful approach extends to its American operation, Beretta U.S.A. To satisfy Congressional rules that a certain percentage of goods covered by a Pentagon contract must be made in America, Beretta makes 9-millimeter pistols at a factory in Accokeek, Md. It is a relatively small-scale operation. ''We had the choice of raising more capital to set up a bigger operation, but we decided to do only as much as we knew we could do well,'' said Mr. Beretta. **********That is an attitude the modern world, with its push for growth every quarter, has not always favored. But the Berettas have the luxury of looking back, a long way back, and of knowing it is not explosive growth, but quiet staying power, that pays off."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/07/world/walters-opens-talks-with-syria.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1987-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 281, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WALTERS OPENS TALKS WITH SYRIA", "print_headline": "WALTERS OPENS TALKS WITH SYRIA", "body_text": " **********Vernon A.

Pervez, on charges of trying to circumvent American export laws to acquire the alloy for shipment to Pakistan. Mr. Pervez is also accused of offering bribes to American officials. **********American law enforcement agents said Mr. Pervez had led them to believe that the material - 50,000 pounds of a special steel compound produced by the Carpenter Steel Corporation in Reading, Pa. - was intended for Pakistan's nuclear program. Members of Congress, concerned that Pakistan may be proceeding with nuclear weapons research and development, are seeking to withhold aid from the Government of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq if this is the case. **********Pakistan has said repeatedly that it is not developing nuclear weapons, although it is developing peaceful uses of nuclear power. It repeated the denial today. **********The Foreign Ministry said the United States Embassy had requested an appointment to discuss the implications of the Pervez case with the Government, but a date had not been set. Afghan Issue Is Cited **********Pakistani officials said they were the target of Soviet or Afghanistan-sponsored campaigns to discredit them because this country provides bases for seven guerrilla armies fighting the Kabul Government. Pakistan's role is important to United States efforts to weaken the Soviet-backed Kabul regime through support of the guerrillas. **********American officials in Pakistan said they would not comment on the Pervez case or on the larger issue of Pakistan's nuclear program. But the former Ambassador in Islamabad, Deane R. Hinton, warned Pakistan against nuclear weapons development in several speeches and interviews before his recent departure. **********He cautioned Pakistanis not to view nuclear development as a matter of national pride in the face of India's testing of a nuclear device 13 years ago. Some Pakistanis regard this issue as a test of sovereignty, particularly in relations with the United States. **********In its statement today and in answers to questions put to a Foreign Ministry spokesman, the Government described Congressional criticism regarding the Pervez case as propaganda against Pakistan. It called the charges against Mr. Pervez ''baseless'' but added that it would be up to the American courts to decide the case. **********Whatever the decision, Pakistan said, the Government, its agencies and private Pakistani companies had ''no connection whatever with Pervez.'' **********A Foreign Ministry spokesman, who was not identified, said Pakistan was concerned that this case was getting publicity on the eve of Congressional hearings on aid. Disinformation Is Seen **********''This is not the first time such a coincidence has taken place,'' the spokesman said. He said it was beginning to look as if a disinformation campaign was under way against Pakistan so American aid would be adversely affected. Congress is considering a six-year aid package worth $4 billion. **********Today, some Pakistanis who have been following the country's nuclear program closely said there was skepticism about the Government's denials in the Pervez case because of certain unanswered questions. **********Among these are why such a large quantity of the steel alloy was ordered, and where the foreign currency needed for the purchase would have originated if not from Government sources. **********The credibility of Pakistan's denials was diminished earlier this year, many contend, by the publication in India and Pakistan of articles purporting to be based on an interview with the man thought to have masterminded a Pakistani nuclear weapon, Abdul Qadeer Khan. In the interview with an Indian journalist, Kuldip Nayar, and a Pakistani editor, Mushahid Hussain, Mr. Khan refused to answer yes or no to a question about whether Pakistan had a nuclear weapon. He was quoted as having said, however, that Pakistan had proved wrong those who doubted its ability to produce one. **********Mr. Khan later denied he had said this.

But the high cost of running a branch and the rise of automatic teller machines and banking by phone have spurred some institutions to reduce their retail locations. Even banks that are opening new branches are making do with much smaller space. **********Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover and Citibank are among the major institutions in New York that have closed branches over the last few years. Last winter Chase Manhattan, in what was believed to be the largest consolidation in recent years, announced that it would eliminate 47 of its 231 branches in the metropolitan area within 18 months. **********''A review of the system showed that some branches were unprofitable and redundant,'' said Kenneth A. Mills, a Chase spokesman. ''In some areas there were two or more branches within a few blocks of each other, and in other places, like White Plains, where there were six branches, there were more locations than the population could support.'' **********Of the 47 Chase branches to be closed, 33 are in retail spaces that the bank leases and 14 are in buildings that the bank owns. **********In some places, Chase has allowed leases to expire; at others, it is subleasing or selling the space. So far, the bank has sold six properties, three to other banks. Of the spaces to be sublet, other banks will take nine. **********According to Joseph Schlang, a real estate broker who specializes in bank space, the high cost of renewal leases is a prime contributor to the consolidation programs at some banks. **********''In Manhattan, some deals were signed when the space was $20 a foot,'' said Mr. Schlang, who came out of retirement a few years ago to found Bank Locations, a real estate brokerage firm that specializes in bringing together banks that want to give up branch space and those looking to expand. Today rent can be four times that. **********One way that banks justify the cost of new branches is with smaller operations, and electronic banking has made this possible. Before electronic aids, retail bank operations demanded 5,000 to 10,000 square feet. Today banks are signing deals for 3,000-to-4,000-square-foot spaces. **********But space aside, banks still need good locations. Mr. Schlang said that banks looking to expand could expect to pay between $75 and $100 a square foot in Manhattan. **********While Chase is consolidating its branch operations, other banks, like Apple Bank for Savings, are expanding. Still others, like Bankers Federal Savings, are planning to expand. **********''Smaller banks are going for the smaller business customer, the entreprenuer, and giving him attention and time,'' said Illene Burack, Mr. Schlang's associate in Bank Locations. ''Those banks are expanding in areas like the East Village in Manhattan, and Flushing and Astoria in Queens, where there has been a tremendous influx of new residents and small businesses.'' **********Apple Bank expects to open its first branch in Queens, at 3506 Broadway in Astoria, by the end of the year. The 7,000-square-foot branch will be only a few blacks from where Chase is closing a branch, at 30-30 Steinway Street. **********''We have grown tremendously in the last few years,'' said Anthony M. Ronda, vice president for marketing for Apple Bank. ''We have been putting our earnings into the development of new locations,'' **********Late last year the bank acquired the Eastern Savings Bank, increasing its branches to 23 from 16. Since then, Apple has opened a branch on Long Island. That branch and the new one in Queens will bring the number of its retail locations to 25. Mr. Ronda said the bank was hoping to expand in Queens and Long Island. **********Raymond A. Lein, president of Bankers Federal Savings, said the closing of its main retail location at 24 John Street last month was not an indication that the bank was consolidating but a sign that it was ready to expand. **********''We had run out of space there,'' he said of the building that Bankers Federal had recently sold. ''But we are moving to keep up with the needs of our depositors. In that respect, our future lies in the expansion of our branch operations.'' **********In its John Street building, its administrative offices were squeezed into 7,000 square feet above the ground floor. This week the bank's offices were moved to 13,000 square feet of space in an office building at 110 Williams Street. **********The bank operates two branches in Manhattan, two in Flushing and one in Brooklyn. Mr. Lein said that the bank, which was established in 1890 as the Bank Clerks Cooperative Building and Loan Society, is converting from a mutual to a stock institution.

The Prime Minister's move came after Mr. Leotard rejected an ultimatum Saturday night to either stop campaigning for himself and his party or resign his Ministerial post, but pledged that his public remarks in the future would be intended to help the Government as a whole. **********The telegram was generally seen as a climb down by Mr. Chirac, who was incensed when Mr. Leotard publicly told his supporters last week not to vote for the Prime Minister in the first round of next year's two-ballot presidential election. Instead, Mr. Leotard said, they should support either him, if he runs, or the former Prime Minister, Raymond Barre, Mr. Chirac's principal conservative rival. **********''Leotard didn't give way,'' Lionel Jospin, secretary of the opposition Socialists, said today. ''It was neither resignation nor submission,'' commented Jean-Pierre Soisson, a Republican Party leader. **********The public quarrel between Mr. Leotard and Mr. Chirac is significant in several respects. For four days now, Mr. Leotard has held part of France in suspense while he debated whether to plunge the ruling coalition into a major crisis by walking out. His photogenic features have appeared in a number of newspapers and on television screens. By neither surrendering nor resigning, Mr. Leotard has demonstrated his distance from Mr. Chirac and re-emphasized his party's claim as an independent political body that, while in the alliance with Mr. Chirac's neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic, retains an image and views of its own. **********The dispute also illustrates Mr. Chirac's weakening grip over his coalition Government as the elections approach. If President Francois Mitterrand, France's Socialist head of state, runs again, he will be the clear favorite. Among conservative competitors, Mr. Barre is ahead of Mr. Chirac. **********Against competition like this, Mr. Leotard can have little hope in next year's presidential race, but he is only 45 years old, and time is on his side. If Mr. Chirac fails to win the presidency, many expect a realignment of right-wing forces in France and a search for new leadership. **********Mr. Leotard has said his aim is ''to do for the Republican Party what Mitterrand did for the Socialists - make it the biggest party in France,'' and he predicts that it could overtake Mr. Chirac's party to become the principal right-wing body in 10 years. **********But even if it doesn't, the party has already proved to be a powerful springboard, one that propelled its last head, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, to leadership of the right and the Presidency. **********Mr. Leotard is regularly voted the most popular Minister in the Government. He cultivates a Kennedyesque image, appearing youthful, vigorous and modern in outlook. A keen athlete, he frequently runs in marathons. **********With 60 seats in the French Parliament, Mr. Leotard heads a group of eight Republican Ministers, all close in age and outlook. The Ministers are known as ''Leo's Gang'' because of their loyalty to their leader. **********The son of a highly placed civil servant, Mr. Leotard entered a Benedictine monastery at 22, an experience that left him with a penchant for quoting scripture and a taste for the Gregorian chant, the ritual plainsong used in the Roman Catholic Church. **********Later, Mr. Leotard attended the prestigious Ecole Nationale d'Administration, where he became a friend of Laurent Fabius, France's last Socialist Prime Minister, and then entered the civil service. **********Mr. Leotard joined the Republican Party in 1975.

Even in the face of prices that would have appeared irresistible a month ago, the prevailing feeling among some of the country's more conservative investors, some of whom had as much as 50 percent of their portfolios in cash, was that the risk of a further decline outweighed any opportunity. **********''There are some great bargains, but we are saying, 'Give 'em to us cheaper,' '' said Samuel D. Hale, president of Hillside Associates, a Los Angeles firm that manages about $150 million. Mr. Hale, like most of the other managers who were interviewed, describes himself as value-oriented, which means that he buys stocks according to fairly strict standards measuring the price in relation to the company's earnings, cash flow, book value and other factors. **********But like many such players, Mr. Hale is holding back from buying bargains. The potential for a further market decline has become an overriding concern. **********''The market as an entity isn't undervalued; we're only back to fair valuation in terms of the averages,'' Mr. Hale said. ''Bear markets don't stop at fair valuation. They go to undervaluation.'' To tempt Mr. Hale, the Dow Jones industrial average would have to hit the 1,300 level, he said. **********Pessimism about the market's future was echoed, in degrees, at a number of firms. A common theme was fear that political and economic forces were locked at cross-purposes, with no resolution in sight. ''My assumption has always been that somehow or other the Western world muddles through,'' said Marc B. Franklin, who handles about $100 million in discretionary accounts at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Palm Desert, Calif. ''My inclination is to believe that we will muddle through even this.'' **********Yet he has bought little in the last two weeks. Mr. Franklin's accounts on average entered the market break invested in secondary stocks that he regarded as undervalued, with, typically, 20 percent in cash reserves. The cash was ''wildly inadequate'' in the circumstances, he said. Mr. Hale, who held substantial cash in many accounts, concurred. ''The things that I thought were dripping with value in the over-the-counter market have imploded,'' he said. **********As the prices of large companies rose, many value-oriented managers had turned to smaller companies that appeared more attractively priced. In the last two weeks, the declines in smaller, more thinly traded stocks have exceeded the Dow average's slump, jolting even cash-laden managers. ''We were off 16 percent for the month,'' said Chuck Royce, president of the Quest Advisory Corporation, which acts as investment manager for the Pennsylvania Mutual Fund. The firm's accounts averaged about 30 percent cash reserves at the start of October. **********''By all traditional measures of value, if you assume only a moderate economic slowdown, some smaller companies' stock prices represent extraordinarily good value,'' Mr. Franklin said. But he believed some sectors still appeared substantially overvalued, such as cable television operators and biotechnology concerns. ''Is Genentech really worth $2 billion?'' he asked. **********Absent a washout that carries everything to low valuations, Mr. Franklin and some other managers are worried that too many investors remain complacent. ''You know what was really eerie?'' asked a West Coast investment adviser, who did not want to be identified. ''When the market dropped 500 points that day, I got calls from people who asked if we were buying for them. That isn't how it is at the bottom of a bear market. Then they say, 'I'm glad I'm out and don't ever put me back in.' '' Mr. Hale of Hillside concurred. ''At bear market bottoms, you see awful bargains that no one will want to buy,'' he said. **********Daniel R. Long 3d, president of Corbyn Associates, in Baltimore, which manages about $150 million, holds about 60 percent of the average account in cash and equivalents, some raised during the 508-point plunge on Oct. 19. Mr. Long said he had not been a significant buyer either for managed accounts or for the Greenspring Fund, which the firm manages. ''We think we'll have plenty of opportunity to buy,'' Mr. Long said. **********At the Janus Capital Corporation, in Denver, which directs about $1 billion, the main mutual funds were holding about 30 percent cash in early October - and 50 percent to 60 percent cash by last week, according to the firm's president, Thomas Bailey. Mr. Bailey said the funds retained securities such as telephone stocks and some pharmaceutical companies, where he believes much of the risk has been removed by lower prices. But he has not been a buyer. ''The best thing we can do for the clients is to manage the portfolios on a conservation-of-capital basis,'' he said. **********Jerry Carret, chief investment officer at Carret & Company, in New York, said his firm's accounts held up to 25 percent cash largely because the firm had not yet redeployed gains from takeovers and restructurings.

Some steel executives also predicted that prices would increase slightly this year, after years of going down. **********''We believe that price levels will be at least as good as last year and maybe a little better,'' said Walter F. Williams, chairman of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the nation's third-largest steelmaker. ''It's about time that we, with all our efforts at cost reduction and quality improvement, that we get paid for the value added that we are putting into our product.'' **********Officials of large steel companies said their optimism is based on the fact that USX's return to the market will be gradual and that the nation's largest steelmaker has been reducing capacity. Also, the weaker dollar will continue to help fend off imports, they said. Analysts' Viewpoint **********Industry analysts see the situation differently, contending that the resumption of production at USX earlier this year after a six-month work stoppage is almost certain to create intense pressure among producers to discount prices. They say that the USX effect will begin to be felt in the market by midyear. **********They also see price-cutting pressure coming from an expected drop in demand from the automobile and oil industries. Many analysts have forecast that steel prices will fall this year by 2 to 5 percent. **********''The steel companies are saying that prices are holding up and that there is no difficulty,'' said Karlis M. Kiris, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. ''But there is some nervousness. We are expecting prices to go down again this year. The only way prices can remain firm is for the steel companies to be willing to give up market share. And they are unwilling to do that.'' Depressed Prices **********Since 1984, steel prices have been depressed because of increased foreign competition, sagging demand and continued overcapacity. Steel companies have had huge losses and have responded by cutting operating expenses, trimming personnel and upgrading their operations. **********The current firmness in prices has come as a surprise to steel customers, who had anticipated declines following the acceptance of a new labor pact by union workers at USX. Analysts and customers had believed that USX, previously with about 18 percent of the nation's shipments, was certain to cut prices in a push to regain its market share. **********But USX's chairman, David M. Roderick, maintained that the company would not cut prices. He told reporters last month that the company intended to re-enter the market at the prevailing price level. **********''We are actually surprised by the price situation,'' said a top executive of a major steel company, who asked to remain anonymous. ''The USX people have behaved themselves very well and there hasn't been any discounting yet.'' **********Paul O'Hara, director of steel purchasing for the Ford Motor Company, said: ''Spot prices haven't started to move yet. Warehousers thought the prices were going to drop in January and February. But that hasn't happened yet.'' Some Supplies Are Tight **********Some customers said that the firmness in prices is in part a result of a surge in demand in recent months for cold-rolled steel, which is used in automobiles, appliances and furniture. **********''The supply of cold-rolled is tight right now,'' said Robert J. Klein, executive vice president of Worthington Industries, a metals fabricating company that is a large buyer of steel. **********''I haven't seen any change in prices so far after the strike,'' Mr. Kein said. ''That might very well change because some steel producer might try to break the pricing structure. But right now, prices are firm.'' **********The absence of USX's steel operations from the market bolstered the results of its competitors. The LTV Corporation, the nation's second-largest steelmaker, which is in bankruptcy reorganization, reported improved market conditions as a result of the USX shutdown. Also, troubled Bethelehem Steel reported a fourth-quarter profit for the third time in 20 quarters. **********Analysts point out that USX lost out on orders for delivery in the first quarter, since the shutdown did not end until January. They said that the second and third quarters would be a better test of pricing conditions, since USX's sales representatives had been trying for months to win orders for delivery then."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/19/business/advertising-margeotes-fertitta-chosen-by-fur-vault.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Margeotes, Fertitta Chosen by Fur Vault", "print_headline": "Advertising; Margeotes, Fertitta Chosen by Fur Vault", "body_text": " **********Margeotes, Fertitta & Weiss has become the ad agency for Fred, the Fur Vault, a division of the Fur Vault.

Today it is a patchwork of fields dusted with sand and blotches of land turned bald by overgrazing, overcutting and overcultivating. War on Desertification **********Ten years ago this month, delegates gathered in Nairobi, Kenya, for a United Nations conference on desertification, in which marginal fields and pastures are turned into barren wasteland by human abuses, such as cutting down too many trees, and such natural factors as erosion. **********At the end, the delegates drew up a sweeping program aimed at stopping desertification by the year 2000. **********Behind the bold plan were memories of a 1973 drought that killed 100,000 to 250,000 people and 3.5 million cattle in the Sahel region of West Africa. That focused the greatest attention on the Sahel, an area encompassing nine countries: Burkina Faso, formerly known as Upper Volta, Cape Verde, Chad, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal. #300 Missions in a Year Today, as it was 10 years ago, the Sahel is the largest area in the world to be threatened by a loss of arable land. **********Today, the Sahel receives the largest amount of foreign aid per capita of any region in the world. In one year alone, Burkina Faso, a nation of 7 million people, received 300 aid missions to improve rural water supplies. **********After a decade of various efforts, the results are mixed. **********Scientists say desertification is continuing. The Niger, Shari and Senegal rivers have dropped markedly since the late 1960's. Lake Chad has shrunk to about 800 square miles from 9,650 square miles in 1972. A Development Challenge **********But development experts say they have learned more effective ways of helping people in the Sahel slow the degradation of their land. **********Barely touched by a few decades of French colonialism, the traditional societies of the Sahel's fragile nations present an enormous development challenge. **********Spreading over an area 10 times as large as Spain, the Sahel has roughly the same population, 37 million. But, World Bank statistics list the total value of the Sahel's annual output of goods and services as just 4 percent of that of Spain. Pressures on a Fragile Land **********''It is hard to ask someone who is hungry to plant trees,'' said Mahamane Brah, executive secretary of the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel, which represents all of the region's countries. **********The Sahel's growing population puts constant pressure on the fragile land, a transition zone between the Sahara in the north and the humid savanna in the south. In the Sahel, the average annual growth rate of the population is 2.6 percent, compared with nine-tenths of 1 percent for Spain. **********''The demographic growth is a major problem,'' Mr. Brah said in an interview in his office in Ouagadougou, the Burkina Faso capital. ''Where a family of five used to support itself on five acres, they now have two. The land no longer rests.'' 'Families Keep Going' **********In the fields here, Mr. Ouedraogo has seen more and more families move to Boussouma in recent years. They are fleeing the sand and exhausted land of northern Burkina Faso. **********''Now the families keep going to the south,'' he said, talking quietly in the glow of a kerosene lamp as the storm of sand and dust raged outside the tool shed. **********But even to the south, along the 50-mile stretch of road between here and Ouagadougou, the landscape is broken by patches of bare clay. **********Voracious goats chew all the greenery within reach, sometimes even leaping onto the lower branches of trees to eat the leaves. Trucks from Ougadougou drive out here to collect firewood for the city's burgeoning population. Reforestation Efforts **********In the last 20 years, the Sahel's urban population has quadrupled. The cities are now surrounded by ever-widening ''halos'' of deforestation, said Mr. Brah, whose group's slogan is ''A Green Sahel.'' **********''Before, in Timbuktu or Bamako, you could find wood one mile outside the city,'' he said, referring to Mali's two largest cities. ''Now you can go 30 miles before finding trees.'' **********Reforestation is a key component of anti-desertification programs that have been drawn up recently by each of the Sahelian countries. **********However, in a region where wood provides 80 percent to 90 percent of energy needs, progress to preserve and replant trees has been slow. Spreading the Word **********Each year, Sahelian nations strip trees from an area of 1,000 to 1,500 square miles, and only reforest a tenth of that, Mr. Brah estimated. **********Using radio, posters and women's groups to spread the word, Burkina Faso has one of the region's most ambitious wood-conservation programs. The Government promotes energy-efficient wood stoves, uses a state wood supply agency to limit abuses by woodcutters, urges citizens to mark family celebrations by planting a tree, and calls on volunteers to help plant the ''forest of the revolution.'' **********Despite this effort, Burkina Faso each year deforests about 230 square miles of land and replants only about 85 square miles, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says. **********''We found that forestry programs do not work very well if they are not integrated with agriculture and animal husbandry,'' Anne de Lattre, director of the Club du Sahel, said in a telephone interview from Paris. The Club coordinates Western donor aid to the region. Lack of Trained People **********She said that international donor funding to the Sahel had increased by an average of 4 percent a year over the last decade. But she said half of that went to ''survival'' assistance, largely for food and support for budgets. **********To Helmut Eger, a West German adviser to the Drought Control Committee, the problem is not lack of money, but of projects, and a need for outside experts, who are discouraged from working here by the difficult conditions. **********''I have never worked in a place where there are so many medical evacuations'' of aid workers due to the tropical heat and insect-bites, he said. Mr. Eger noted that during the dry season the low temperature in the Sahel, even at night, often is 100 degrees. **********''Almost every European here knows someone who has died - malaria, hepatitis A, hepatitis B,'' he said. **********Boussouma is one of 160 villages in Burkina Faso where West German technicians are overseeing a project to counter the degradation of farmland by slowing the runoff of water and soil nutrients. They are doing this by helping farmers such as Mr. Ouedraogo to revive the traditional Sahelian practice of building 12-inch-high stone dikes across their fields. **********As the rain lifted and the sun broke out, Mr. Ouedraogo, who works with Mr. Eger as an agricultural extension agent, ventured forth with the West German to show a visitor the village fields. **********Rivulets carrying away topsoil scored the fields without dikes. In the others, rich chocolate soil had clotted behind the dikes, and rainwater was soaking into the earth. **********''In two-and-a-half-acre test plots without the dikes, we get 1,000 pounds of soybeans,'' Mr. Eger said. ''With the dikes, the harvest is 2,500 pounds.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/29/world/harare-journal-a-guarantee-and-an-era-fade-away-in-zimbabwe.html": {"writer_name": "Sheila Rule", "pub_date": "1987-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 980, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A GUARANTEE, AND AN ERA, FADE AWAY IN ZIMBABWE", "print_headline": "HARARE JOURNAL; A GUARANTEE, AND AN ERA, FADE AWAY IN ZIMBABWE", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Robert Mugabe is moving cautiously to abolish guaranteed white seats in Parliament in his drive to turn this multiparty democracy into a one-party state. **********When independence arrived in this country, formerly known as Rhodesia, the minority whites were guaranteed 20 seats in the 100-member Parliament for seven years to assure them of at least a residual political role in a land they once ruled. **********The seventh anniversary of Zimbabwe's independence this month meant that the guarantee of white seats, contained in a British-drafted constitution, could be abolished with the support of 70 members of Parliament. There is virtually no doubt in this southern African nation that Mr. Mugabe will have the guarantee of white seats scrapped. The only questions are when and how. **********The suspension from Parliament earlier this month of Ian D. Smith, the last white Prime Minister of Rhodesia, effectively ended a political career that spanned nearly four decades and foreshadowed the demise of the white seats. Mr. Smith fought independence by leading his white followers into a fierce conflict with black nationalists. Opposed Pretoria Sanctions **********The suspension was voted because Mr. Smith called Zimbabwe's decision to impose economic sanctions against South Africa ''stupid,'' and urged Pretoria to fight international pressure to dismantle apartheid. **********Mr. Mugabe has long said that the guaranteed white seats gave whites representation far out of proportion to their numbers. There are 110,000 whites in this nation of eight million. **********Mr. Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front has 66 seats in Parliament and is confident that it can get the four votes needed to abolish the white seats, perhaps when Parliament reconvenes in June. **********It had been thought that talks intended to merge the ruling party and the minority party of Joshua Nkomo, the Prime Minister's longtime political enemy, would easily provide the 70 votes needed. But the Prime Minister recently said the talks had failed. Mugabe Moving Cautiously **********Government officials said they were confident that some Nkomo supporters, along with some of the five white independent legislators and the sole white member of Parliament in Mr. Mugabe's party, would vote to scrap the white seats. **********The Prime Minister has said he wants to set aside the white seats immediately. But he appears to be moving cautiously. **********Zimbabwean and foreign political analysts said Mr. Mugabe must weigh several concerns. Most whites are politically apathetic, they said, but it would be in the Prime Minister's interest to keep at least some ''token'' whites in Parliament in recognition of the minority's economic dominance. **********It would also show that Mr. Mugabe was continuing his policy of racial reconciliation, the analysts said, and play well before foreign audiences. Few Whites Upset **********Few whites appear to be concerned about the coming transition, having anticipated it for some time. Life for many whites is still sweet by any standards in a country with socialist goals but capitalist underpinnings. **********After independence perhaps 100,000 whites left, most of them for South Africa. Now they are slowly returning, and many acknowledge that their worst fears about a black-ruled country have not been realized. **********The swimming pools and sprawling homes of a wealthy white elite, waited on by black servants, punctuate the landscape of this tidy capital city and highlight the economic power whites retain. These whites are cosmopolitan, with foreign bank accounts and large commercial holdings. They see their political future not in voting but in lobbying Government ministries that oversee their special interests. **********Another white culture, including blue-collar workers, is struggling to make ends meet, however. These whites apparently felt threatened by the black government. But they now appear resigned, and the talk these days among both the elite and the working class is not so much about politics as about the rising cost of living, crime and the ailing economy. **********The Government must also decide how the 20 seats, once vacated by whites, would be filled. There must be a full 100-seat Parliament until 1990, when the constitution may be rewritten and the next election is scheduled. **********An early general election has been all but ruled out, according to Government officials, because it would require costly administrative tasks. One official said the Justice Minister was considering an electoral college made up of black members of Parliament that would elect legislators, black or white, to the 20 seats. Smith Seen as Disruptive **********Mr. Smith, 68 years old, a craggy-faced man who has remained outspoken and unrepentant, is portrayed by many whites here as discredited and disruptive to race relations. **********In 1985, in the first general election since independence, Mr. Smith's party - its power eroded by a mass defection of legislators - won 15 of the 20 white seats. Blacks saw his unexpected victory as whites choosing confrontation over cooperation, and Mr. Mugabe was visibly angered. **********White independent members of Parliament supported Mr. Smith's suspension. Mr. Smith could not be reached for comment. **********Mark Partridge, a member of Mr. Smith's party, the Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe, said Mr. Smith's suspension highlighted the ''dual approach'' among whites. **********''There is one approach that says the Government is corrupt, with nepotism and tribalism,'' Mr. Partridge said. ''These Europeans say the best way to look after our rights is not to stand up for principle.'' **********''The other approach - our approach - is that the Government is inexperienced but not unintelligent,'' he added. ''Things must be based on reason and principle, and, where we can't go along with something, we must say so.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/20/business/finance-new-issues-9.35-notes-issued-by-republic-bank.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "9.35% Notes Issued By Republic Bank", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; 9.35% Notes Issued By Republic Bank", "body_text": " **********The Republic National Bank of New York is offering $100 million of 9.35 percent notes due in 1994 at par through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. **********Noncallable for four years, the notes yield about eight-tenths of a percentage point more than Treasury securities of similar maturity.

But several difficult hurdles remain. Principal among them is a profound disagreement over the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty - a matter that Soviet officials still say must be resolved before a treaty on long-range arms can be completed. Differences on Method **********Even if the two sides could resolve this critical question, there would still be significant differences over how to cut long-range arms. **********On the ABM treaty, the gulf between the two sides still appears wide, though Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that the ''tone'' of the dialogue seemed more positive. **********Under the latest position advanced by Moscow, the Soviet Union insists that each side promise not to withdraw from the ABM treaty for 10 years. The United States has offered to observe the treaty through 1994, though some Administration officials have hinted that Washington might be flexible on this count. **********After his meetings with Mr. Shultz and Mr. Reagan, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said this dispute over the period of adherence to the treaty remained. **********A further question is what to do after the pledge not to withdraw from the treaty has expired. U.S. Wants 'Star Wars' **********The United States wants a green light at this point to proceed with the deployment of a space-based missile defense. American officials also stress that the two sides would remain bound to the terms of the new treaty reducing long-range arms after adherence to the ABM treaty was dropped. **********But Soviet officials today reportedly repeated their argument that each side should be free to build up their arsenal of long-range arms if the ABM treaty is abandoned. **********The key issue has been how the ABM treaty should be interpreted. **********Last month, Soviet officials said they had proposed that each side adhere to the traditional, strict interpretation of the ABM treaty, which restricts the testing and deployment of anti-missile systems. So far, the Reagan Administration has insisted on the right to interpret the treaty broadly so as to allow an expanded pattern of ''Star Wars'' testing. Moscow Flexibility Seen **********One senior Administration official asserted today that Moscow might be flexible on this issue. He asserted that Mikhail S. Gorbachev's letter to Mr. Reagan did not repeat earlier Soviet language about strengthening the ABM treaty and stressed the importance of agreeing on a period of non-withdrawal from the treaty. Nor does the letter explicitly restate an earlier Soviet proposal that experts meet to clarify what testing is allowed in space, though one official said the letter appeared to allude to this possibility. **********This, he asserted, showed that nailing down a period of non-withdrawal from the treaty was more of a priority for Moscow than securing American agreement to a strict interpretation. **********But another senior Administration official disagreed with this interpretation. He said that the letter did not signal any basic change in the Soviet position on interpreting the treaty, but he added that the Soviet position was simply ''packaged'' in a way that was more subtle than some previous proposals. **********Mr. Shevardnadze told reporters the two sides did not talk about treaty interpretation today, but he asserted there was no change in the Soviet position. **********On long-range arms, Viktor P.

Analysts have also been troubled by Crazy Eddie's declining profitability. **********When Mr. Antar resigned, rumors circulated that he had been ill. But he appeared at a Crazy Eddie board meeting yesterday morning and informed the company's directors of the offer. A letter then officially notified the company that Newco, an entity formed by Mr. Antar and the First City Capital Corporation, an investment company owned by the Belzbergs, would offer shareholders $7 a share in cash as part of a negotiated merger transaction. **********The stock was initially offered to the public in September 1984 at $8 a share, and after dropping, it climbed as high as $21.625 in 1986. Last November Mr. Antar sold more than 1.5 million shares at prices ranging from $15 to $19. **********The bidders said that they already owned 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million common shares outstanding. Mr. Antar owns 11 percent and the Belzbergs the remainder. **********The board of Crazy Eddie, based in Edison, N.J., said only that it would consider the unsolicited offer. A company spokesman said yesterday afternoon that a committee of outside directors had been appointed to review the offer and would shortly appoint a financial adviser. Neither Mr. Antar nor the Belzbergs could be reached for comment. Crazy Eddie Stock Soars **********Crazy Eddie stock closed up $2.625, at $7.875, in over-the-counter trading yesterday. The fact that the stock price closed higher than the offer suggested to some that another bid from the group could be forthcoming. **********''I think that the offer is just the first gambit in a game to put the stock in play,'' said Barry Bryant, retail analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''I think the stock may well go to $10. But what Eddie Antar is up to can range from really wanting to buy the company to trying to liquidate the family holdings. The Belzbergs, I think, just see it as an undervalued stock and therefore an opportunity.'' **********In New York's frenetically competitive electronics market, Crazy Eddie, long the exponent of television come-ons with its ''Prices Are Insane'' slogan, recently has suffered a falling stock price, declining Christmas business in its older stores and Wall Street skepticism, much of it attributed to the mysterious withdrawal of Mr. Antar. A Mystifying Withdrawal **********The company's founder has become inaccessible to analysts, some of whom had earlier recommended his company with considerable enthusiasm, and a three-man ''office of the president'' created after his resignation has also not been available to outsiders. **********The combination of Mr. Antar's unexplained withdrawal and his recent disposition of some of his holdings in the company he founded in 1975 was a source of much discussion among analysts yesterday. **********After a stunning success in building the retail chain to more than 30 stores in the Middle Atlantic area, Mr. Antar not only resigned from the high posts but sold a large block of his stock at a considerable profit, Stock Price Declines As sales at Crazy Eddie's older stores fell 9 percent last Christmas and the company pulled back on a home-shopping plan announced last December, the stock value fell sharply. And now Mr. Antar's return with an offer to take the company private at less than half what he had sold the stock for in November appeared to Wall Street observers to raise many questions. **********''We on Wall Street got so that we began to feel that the expression 'anything is possible' was just a cliche,'' said Mr. Bryant of Drexel Burnham. ''But now, if you consider Eddie Antar's absence, his motives and his stock sales, I guess the cliche is reality.'' **********A number of shareholder lawsuits have been filed against both Crazy Eddie and Mr. Antar in connection with his share sale last fall. Lawyers said yesterday that they expected the move by Mr. Antar to buy the company would start a new round of suits challenging the offer. A Troubling Fiscal Year **********In the fiscal year ended March 1, Crazy Eddie's net income fell 19.7 percent, to $10.6 million, or 34 cents a share, from $13.2 million, or 48 cents a share, the year before. Sales, however, rose 34.4 percent, to $352.5 million, from $262.3 million, reflecting the opening of several stores. **********The profit erosion resulted from rapidly growing competition from Newmark & Lewis, The Wiz and Trader Horn, among others. Matching prices promoted by Crazy Eddie, the competitors also used gimmicks like free boat rides, contests and unusual store-opening hoopla.

But senior members of the intelligence panel said the Senate Appropriations Committee would move soon to cut off the money needed to complete the chancery. **********''It's time to stop the buck-passing and to make a decision to start over,'' Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, who is chairman of the intelligence committee, said at a news conference. He said the panel had voted 15 to 0 to approve the 18-page report. **********The cost of the embassy project, which includes apartments and other quarters, is estimated at $192 million. The chancery, where sensitive business is conducted, was expected to cost $65 million, of which $23 million has already been spent. **********Administration officials disclosed today that an initial sweep of the present Moscow embassy room used for sensitive conversations - the bubble room - has found no listening devices. American intelligence analysts suspect that Soviet agents planted devices in that room after being allowed to enter secure areas by Marine guards who now face espionage charges. Bubble Rooms Shipped to U.S.  Administration officials said the bubble rooms in Moscow and Vienna are being dismantled and shipped to the United States at a cost of millions of dollars. The officials said it could take months to complete minute examinations of the contents and structures of the rooms before they could be certain whether Soviet agents left behind any eavesdropping equipment. **********At a meeting this month with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, scoffed at reports that Soviet agents had entered the embassy, Administration officials said. According to one account of the conversation provided by an American official, Mr. Gorbachev assured Mr. Shultz that there had been no entry into the embassy. **********Mr. Gorbachev's remark was considered highly unusual by counterintelligence experts, who noted that in no case in recent memory had the Soviet Union offered a similar reassurance. **********Administration officials said they were proceeding on the ''worst-case'' assumption that significant damage resulted from the Marine guards' purported espionage. The major evidence that Soviet agents were permitted to enter the embassy was a statement to investigators, since recanted, by Cpl. Arnold Bracy, one of the Marines accused of spying. Serious Harm May Have Resulted **********Robert Lamb, the senior State Department official responsible for embassy security, said in an interview today that he still thought the case had caused serious harm. But he said it would probably be months before intelligence experts could be precise about the scope and nature of the damage. **********The Senate intelligence committee report, based on testimony at three closed hearings, said the worst-case assessments presume that Soviet agents had access for hours at a time to ''the most sensitive areas of the embassy.'' **********That would give the Russians time to penetrate all the locks and alarms, forcing intelligence analysts to presume that all documents and communications had been compromised. **********The report blames the State Department for many of the security shortcomings that lead to embassy guards' alleged espionage, and to the compromise of the new chancery building. Report's Recommendations **********It called for polygraph examinations of each Marine ending a tour abroad and ''counterintelligence'' investigations of any rules infraction, like black-market currency dealings or socializing with local women. The report was also sharply critical of the alarm system in the Moscow embassy, saying the reliance on the honesty of the Marines left the compound with a ''single failure point.'' **********More generally, the report said that the security and building aspects of the State Department were ''fragmented and scattered in at least three different major organizational units.'' **********It called on the State Department to combine all of the units into one, and have them report directly to the Secretary of State. **********The most detailed criticism was reserved for the new embassy. In 1972, the Nixon Administration agreed to permit the Soviet Union to prefabricate off-site the concrete slabs at the new embassy. American officials did not insist on the right to inspect the work while the concrete was being poured. **********Beginning in 1979, the State Department began finding listening devices in the building. Construction was not halted until 1985. Today, Senator William S. Cohen, the Maine Republican who is vice chairman of the intelligence committee, said it would take two to three years for the intelligence experts to determine whether the building could be salvaged. ''We're not going to wait two to three years to find out the building is one giant antenna,'' he said. **********Senator Cohen also said he favored legislation to eject the Soviet Union from its new embassy, which is on one of the highest points in Washington. The Russians have not occupied the chancery of that building, but are using its apartments at a site intelligence officials say is ideally suited to intercept electronic communications. **********Other recommendations in the report include removing foreign employees from other United States embassies worldwide and shortening the Marine guards' tour of duty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/09/world/kemp-in-honduras-assails-latin-peace-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 548, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kemp, in Honduras, Assails Latin Peace Plan", "print_headline": "Kemp, in Honduras, Assails Latin Peace Plan", "body_text": " **********Representative Jack F.

Schlesinger, a former Secretary of Defense and former Director of Central Intelligence, said the Soviet bugging devices represented ''a higher plateau of technology'' than the United States had seen. He indicated that Soviet intelligence services are ahead of the United States in this area. **********Mr. Schlesinger estimated today that building new secure areas would cost ''many tens of millions of dollars'' and require renegotiation of a contract with the Soviet Government. Simultaneous Occupancy **********In a preview of recommendations he plans to make to Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Mr, Schlesinger said that much of the uncompleted eight-story office building, or chancery, can be salvaged, but only for diplomatic work that does not require a high degree of security. **********Under a 15-year-old Soviet-American agreement, the two sides are to occupy their new chancery structures - the Soviet Union has nearly completed one in northwest Washington - at the same time. If the American structure has to be rebuilt, this could indefinitely postpone Soviet occupancy of its new office building. **********The brick American office building is part of a new embassy complex that has already cost an estimated $190 million. The apartments, commissary, restaurant and recreational facilities are already in use and are not affected by the security problems, but the diplomats walk to work in the old embassy, a nearby block of aging, converted apartment buildings. Bugs in the Beams **********Mr. Schlesinger was asked to investigate the chancery building last year, as American intelligence experts continued to discover listening devices implanted in precast concrete pillars and beams. **********Since the spring, some members of Congress have been expressing outrage at the bugging and have suggested that the building be demolished. The Administration has declined to comment on the fate of the building until Mr. Schlesinger makes his report. **********Today, Mr. Schlesinger faulted American officials for ''naivete'' and ''complacency'' in allowing Soviet workers to prefabricate concrete components of the new building away from the construction site. **********He said X-ray machines were used to screen the concrete slabs brought to the site, but that the Soviet Union had developed listening devices invisible to conventional screening. **********Mr. Schlesinger, who was assisted in his study by American intelligence agencies and private consultants, seemed impressed by what he called ''ingenious'' Soviet advances in eavesdropping technology. A New Detection Device **********''This is one of those areas in which there is, to say the least, no technological gap between the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Schlesinger said. ''If there is a technology gap it tends to run the other way. The United States is more capable in some respects of producing certain types of devices, but the Soviet Union has been more ingenious in exploiting the technology.'' **********''Their tradecraft has been impressive,'' the former C.I.A. director added. ''Were it not for the fact that we had a new detection device, this would have gone undetected.'' **********He did not describe the special features of the bugging devices except to say that they were invisible to X-ray machines used to screen building materials at the embassy site. **********Much remains unknown to American security experts about the honeycomb of devices, he said, including how the network was supposed to work, whether it was operational, whether all of the devices have been discovered, and whether they could be neutralized by American technology. The Prudent Choice **********Because it would take years to answer those questions, he said, the prudent choice would be a major overhaul. **********Mr. Schlesinger said the rapidly rising sophistication of Soviet eavesdropping technology also raises more serious concern about the physical security of embassy buildings. If unauthorized people get into a building to plant devices, he said, it is no longer clear that the bugs can be detected in an electronic sweep. **********Mr. Schlesinger said that if the Soviet Union cooperates in renegotiating the 1972 agreement under which embassy construction was begun, it would still take at least two and a half years before the building could be occupied. **********Without such cooperation, he said, the date when American diplomats could begin using the new offices ''might even be decades in the future.'' Risk for U.S.-Soviet Relations **********Mr. Schlesinger said senior Soviet officials he talked to this week seemed to appreciate that a failure to cooperate would damage Soviet-American relations and prevent Soviet diplomats from occupying their own newly built embassy building in Washington. **********He said that in his meetings with Soviet officials he also raised the issue of financial compensation for the bugging damage, but ''did not proceed very far.'' **********The Soviet Union insisted, as part of the 1972 agreement, on having much of the building prefabricated away from the site, arguing that this was the usual procedure in the Soviet Union. Mr. Schlesinger said a review of records found that American officials did not strongly resist, and filed few protests during the course of construction. **********''As one looks at the agreement in retrospect, there is no conclusion that can be drawn other than that it was a mistake to create conditions in which Soviets were allowed to precast elements of this facility off site,'' he said. ''That created an opporunity, I might even say a temptation, that no one engaged in that line of business was likely to be able to resist.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/world/albania-planning-west-german-ties.html": {"writer_name": "David Binder", "pub_date": "1987-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 858, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALBANIA PLANNING WEST GERMAN TIES", "print_headline": "ALBANIA PLANNING WEST GERMAN TIES", "body_text": " **********The Communist leadership of Albania, moving gradually out of a long period of self-imposed isolation, will establish diplomatic ties with West Germany this month, according to officials in Bonn and Washington. **********This and other diplomatic moves by Albania seem to be opening the country more to the West, while maintaining coolness toward Soviet-bloc nations. But there seems to be no prospect of a warming toward the United States. **********In a speech June 25 in Tirana, the capital, President Ramiz Alia said negotiations begun three years ago between Albania and West Germany were ''being concluded.'' **********At the same time, Mr. Alia invited Britain to open talks on establishing diplomatic ties, saying it was time to unfreeze the relationship after a break between the two nations 41 years ago. Mr. Alia said the British would find ''a readiness to talk.'' Dropping Reparations Claims **********His disclosure of the imminent diplomatic ties with West Germany and the prospect of talks with Britain appears to indicate that Albania has given up a series of extravagant claims for reparations from West Germany and demands for the unilateral return of Albanian gold sequestered by Britain, France and the United States at the end of World War II. **********A decade ago, Tirana was insisting that West Germany owed $4.5 billion in damages from the wartime occupation of Albania by Hitler's armies, a claim the Bonn Government rejected. Though paying no reparations, West Germany is apparently preparing to make some generous investments in Albania. **********The issue of the Albanian gold, valued at about $36 million, is complicated by a British claim for compensation arising from the Corfu Channel incident, in which 38 sailors were killed when two British destroyers struck mines near the coast of Albania in 1946. Britain later won a World Court decision awarding it compensation, but Albania disclaimed responsibility for the mining. **********The incident led to the breach in relations between the two nations. The United States ended relations with Albania about the same time, in protest against harassment of American diplomats by the newly established Communist Government. **********Talks between London and Tirana on the gold and the Corfu Channel claim began two years ago, but now President Alia seems to be saying the two Governments should move on and discuss resumption of diplomatic relations. Keeping Superpowers Apart **********Britain will take up the Albania issues with the United States before sounding out Tirana on Mr. Alia's overture, an Administration official said. In the last dozen years the United States has periodically proposed a dialogue with Albania leading to re-establishing ties, but has been rebuffed by Tirana. The Soviet Union has made similar proposals and has also been rebuffed. **********Like his predecessor, Enver Hoxha, who died in 1985, President Alia seems determined to keep the two superpowers at arm's length, while steadily broadening contacts with smaller countries in the East and West. The rationale for this, repeatedly articulated by Mr. Hoxha and now by Mr. Alia, is the assertion that both the Soviet Union and the United States grossly interfered in Albanian affairs in the past and would like to do so again. **********In the last four years, Albania has greatly improved relations with Italy, France, Greece, Algeria, Rumania and, more recently, Turkey. In each case, Albania has sought to improve its foreign economic ties and to bring more modern technology into the country. **********For instance, with the Turks, whose forefathers ruled Albania for 500 years until 1912, the Alia Government has concluded agreements on trade, tourism, exchanges of parliamentary delegations and cooperation between the universities of Ankara and Tirana. Criticism of Yugoslavia **********In light of this gradual emergence from a shell of hostility toward much of the rest of the world, the only anomaly in Albania's current foreign relationships involves neighboring Yugoslavia. **********In his speech June 25, Mr. Alia heaped scorn on the Belgrade Government, saying, ''Yugoslavia is to blame for the fact that bilateral relations are burdened by complex and insoluble problems.'' He then referred to the problems of Kosovo, the autonomous region of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia, which has been the scene of repeated nationalist demonstrations by ethnic Albanians who constitute the majority of the region's population. There are almost two million ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia, most of them residing in Kosovo. Albania's population is three million. **********Belgrade's reaction to the Alia speech was generally one of dismay and bitterness. **********The paradoxical aspect of the Yugoslav-Albanian relationship is that while excoriating the Belgrade authorities, the Tirana Government continues a flourishing trade and other contacts with Yugoslavia. A Principal Trading Partner **********Yugoslavia is Albania's principal trading partner, selling a variety of manufactured goods and buying petroleum and electrical power. Last year Yugoslavia completed its part of a railway line linking Albania's small rail system to the railroads of the rest of Europe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/20/business/advertising-honors-for-dailey-head-in-anti-drug-effort.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Honors for Dailey Head In Anti-Drug Effort", "print_headline": "Advertising; Honors for Dailey Head In Anti-Drug Effort", "body_text": " **********Philip Joanou, the chairman and chief executive of Dailey & Associates, Los Angeles, will be recognized for developing the concept for the advertising industry's anti-drug campaign.

The episode has also underscored the worsening relations between the Administration and Congress on foreign-policy issues. **********Further, it has exposed continuing problems within the executive decision-making process as the Administration enters its final 18 months. **********Despite overwhelming Congressional opposition to the planned sale, the National Security Council, the State Department and the Defense Department had agreed that sticking with the proposal and possibly losing in Congress would be less damaging to American interests in the Persian Gulf than backing away from a longstanding commitment to Saudi Arabia. 'Widespread Frustration' **********This was especially true, officials argued, at a moment when the Saudis were close to granting American requests to permit Saudi-based early warning electronic surveillance aircraft, known as Awacs, to patrol a larger part of the gulf as part of American efforts to protect shipping. **********Middle East experts at the Pentagon and State Department also felt ''widespread frustration,'' one official said, that their advice was ignored by the White House. **********The specialists, having been bypassed in the secret arms sales to Iran, were trying to design a policy to repair American credibility in the Persian Gulf and felt they needed to demonstrate a steadfast American commitment to the security of the gulf in the midst of the Iran-Iraq war. **********''It's a question of our reliability,'' said Richard W. Murphy, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, who called the Congressional opposition to the proposed sale a ''slap across the face.'' 'The Wrong Signal' **********President Reagan said, ''This action precipitated by Congress sends exactly the wrong signal.'' **********The White House, which said it would re-introduce the plan later, reportedly felt that more conflicting signals would be sent to gulf states by pushing ahead in the face of inevitable defeat. **********Under the law, Congress has 30 days in which to block a proposed arms sale. Resolutions of disapproval, introduced in the House by Lawrence J. Smith, Democrat of Florida, and in the Senate by Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, had gained enough co-sponsors to override a Presidential veto. **********Officials said it was too early to tell whether the withdrawal would affect Saudi policy. Arab nations in the gulf have hesitated to give overt military support to the United States, partly for fear of exposing themselves to attack or sabotage by Iran. No Plans for U.S. Bases **********A Pentagon official said, for example, that there were no plans to seek basing rights in gulf states for American fighter planes that could protect American ships. ''That's not very realistic to expect,'' he said. **********Much of the Congressional opposition to the missile sale was generated by the impression that Saudi Arabia had failed to cooperate militarily with the United States. **********On May 17, after an Iraqi plane attacked the United States frigate Stark in the gulf, killing 37 seamen, Saudi pilots declined an air controller's request to intercept the jet. Peak of Anxiety **********But Administration officials argued that the Saudi pilots behaved properly. They said the Saudis were under orders to defend only their own territory and Awacs aircraft. **********The trouble was, the Administration submitted the sale plan to Congress just 12 days after the attack on the Stark, at the peak of anxiety over gulf policy. An official said the submission, which had been scheduled for the week before the Stark incident, had been delayed at Congressional request. **********In any event, he added, no Congressional opposition to the missile sale had been raised during informal discussions dating from last November. **********The 1,600 Mavericks that were to be sold are more advanced versions of missiles that had been approved for sale in 1984, but were not actually purchased by the Saudis. **********The Saudis already had about 2,600 Mavericks of an earlier design, in which each missile is guided by a television camera, limiting its use to daytime and clear weather. 'Going to Cut and Run?' **********The later version relies on an infrared sensor, which detects heat emissions and can be used at night and in bad weather. **********But the Mavericks are not the real issue, one senior official said. ''What is building here is a fundamental political choice on the part of the United States,'' he said. ''Are we going to continue to be engaged east of Suez, or are we going to follow the British? Are we going to stay, or are we going to cut and run? It's a very fundamental decision, which people are not addressing because it's a very painful one.'' **********It is made more painful by a decline in Congressional confidence in the Administration. ''There is a very great deal of concern, and among some people it edges over toward alarm, that we have no foreign-policy decision-making system,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. ''The possibility of awful mistakes looms on every horizon.'' **********On arms negotiations with Moscow, he said: ''There is a feeling that they're going to rush to a summit and sign an agreement, any agreement. You hear that among conservative Republicans. From liberal Democrats you hear they're going to rush to war. There are very few points in the spectrum where there is not great anxiety.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/world/outlook-for-mozambique-a-drought-and-a-civil-war.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Bernstein", "pub_date": "1987-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Outlook for Mozambique: A Drought and a Civil War", "print_headline": "Outlook for Mozambique: A Drought and a Civil War", "body_text": " **********The rusty ferryboat, loaded with Red Cross supplies and too many passengers, made a serpentine course on what they call the River of Good Signs, chugging past flamingoes and pelicans and lone men in dugout canoes.

The Government, helped by Western donors and a host of voluntary agencies, has shown it can put into place a huge relief operation reaching a large number of the areas affected by drought and war. **********''We don't know about the populations that are inaccessible, and there are areas that are unreachable in this country,'' said one relief worker. ''But if anybody in the accessible areas is starving, it is not because of a lack of food.'' **********''It would be because they were moving from one place to another and died of exhaustion while on the way,'' the worker, Kim Balduc, a representative of the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization, said in her office in Maputo, the capital. **********A United Nations report compiled in February says that as many as 3.5 million people, roughly one-quarter of Mozambique's entire population, are ''severely affected'' by the civil war or drought, meaning that they are unable to produce or buy enough food for themselves. **********The report says one million people have been displaced from their homes by the war, many of them resettled in camps such as Karunga, where relief food can reach them by truck or riverboat convoys, most often guarded from guerrilla attack by the Mozambican Army. **********''This is not like Ethiopia, where there were mass camps with people starving,'' said Vincent Nicod, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Zambezia Province, where Karunga is situated. The reference was to the catastrophic Ethiopian famine of 1984-85. **********''Here it is all on a small scale and very spread out,'' he said. ''You don't have huge numbers in one place, but maybe 25 people here or 100 there. They are small groups who are forced to move from one place to another, and these people are often in very bad shape.'' **********Mr. Nicod said 20 to 25 percent of the children newly arriving in resettlement camps were suffering from severe malnutrition. He compared that with a ''normal'' African rate of 5 to 7 percent. In the village of Maganjadacosta, not far from here, some 18 children in a newly arrived group of 300 died of measles this month. Aid workers said the high death rate from the disease might be linked to their hunger-weakened state.  Thousands Are Brought By the Army to a Camp **********This flat, arid area of cashew trees and elephant grass along the River of Good Signs has for several months been receiving refugees from farther west and north, particularly from towns along the Zambezi River, which cuts Mozambique into northern and southern halves. **********More than 13,000 people have been brought to this sprawling camp, where entire villages of straw huts and straggly vegetable fields have been created under rows of coconut trees. The people here have fled what many call ''bandit'' attacks, referring to the rebels. Many have been brought here by the army in an apparent effort to deny Renamo recruits from the local population. **********Some people say they lived in the bush with little to eat but roots for several weeks after attacks on their villages. A group of 400 new arrivals in Karunga, waiting for some old clothing, blankets and bars of soap to be distributed to them by the Red Cross, clearly showed signs of hardship. Children were commonly infected by scabies. Many of them were obviously malnourished. Young mothers sat listlessly on the ground holding onto skinny babies. **********''You can always tell the new arrivals,'' Mr. Nicod of the Red Cross said. ''They have nothing to eat, almost nothing to wear, no tools, cooking utensils, household goods. But they recover quickly and seem to be doing pretty well after a few months.'' **********One of those new arrivals was Luis Santos Mpicha, a 26-year-old-man in ragged clothing. He said the guerrillas attacked his village in the Micaunde district in July. Mr. Mpicha, who spoke to a reporter in the presence of Government representatives, described the ''bandits'' as young men without uniforms. He said they had long hair, tied up in small braids, beads around their necks and earrings. He said they attacked the village one day at dawn, stole food and supplies, and forced some villagers to carry bags apparently to a base camp some distance from the village. They set fire to some homes and shops and beat some villagers, he said. **********When the village was retaken by Government soldiers in mid-August, Mr. Mpicha said, they picked up villagers, many of whom had fled into the surrounding bush, and brought them to Karunga. **********As Mr. Mpicha talked, a group of soldiers, singing and banging machetes against the side of their truck, arrived in the camp. With them were about a dozen people who had apparently taken refuge in the bush after a guerrilla attack. A few sparse items of furniture and a tattered bag or two were unloaded from the truck and the new arrivals marched off to be registered by the camp's officials. **********The soldiers' commander called himself Jaguar, and he appeared to be drunk. He stayed in the camp for about half an hour, from time to time standing in the front of the 400 bedraggled new arrivals and leading them in chants of ''the struggle continues,'' the major Government slogan in its fight against the guerrillas.  Travel in Countryside Is Considered Precarious **********Residents of Maputo, Mozambique's Portuguese-built capital city, which shows few overt signs of the war, give a common example of the insecurity prevailing in the surrounding countryside, as guerrilla activities have increased during the last two years. **********From Maputo's port, which is operating at one-third of its capacity, distant purple hills on the horizon mark the borders of Swaziland and South Africa. But, though the hills are only about 40 miles away, few people attempt the trip by road. It is simply not considered safe to venture that far from Maputo. **********Indeed, the war, according to many accounts, has virtually sliced this long, coastal country into fragments, making most road travel outside of the major towns precarious. **********Renamo, which is also known as the National Resistance Movement, or M.N.R., its Portuguese initials, has commonly attacked relief convoys taking donated grain to affected areas. The American aid organization CARE, which oversees the transport of relief food with a fleet of 348 donated trucks, has seen 12 of its vehicles put out of operation in such attacks. **********International aid workers say one nothern province, Niassa, has been virtually cut off from the rest of Mozambique, with the only access to the area for relief supplies being across the border with Malawi and back into this country near the border town of Mandimba. **********But about three weeks ago, the supply route was interrupted when rebels attacked Mandimba. Recent Western visitors to the town say that it was virtually levelled. **********The guerrillas have in the last two or so years managed to destroy all of the bridges across the Zambezi. Some river towns, such as Caia, Luabo and Mopeia, were recaptured by Government troops earlier this year after several months in rebel hands. But refugees from those areas say their towns suffered widespread damage and were largely uninhabited. **********Renamo has, officials here say, managed to reduce rail transport from Africa's interior to Mozambique's Indian Ocean ports to a fraction of its normal level. **********The Government, with the help of troops from Zimbabwe, has managed to open a corridor from the Zimbabwe border to the port of Beira, for three trains a day in each direction. Officials and aid workers say the line is more secure now than it has been in several years. **********That achievement has been met by other moves toward restoring normal economic life. In Maputo, for example, Western businessmen are discussing deals with a Government newly receptive to foreign investments. The American company Edlow International has signed an agreement to mine titanium sands on the coast of Zambezia province, with protection provided by the army, diplomats here said. **********However, the two other railroad lines in the south and north of the country have been entirely closed down, as Renamo has apparently sought to destroy one of this country's major traditional functions - to provide access to ports for the landlocked African countries to the west.  Early Days of Rebellion: Support From Rhodesia **********The war dates back to early days of Mozambique's independence from Portugal in 1975, when the newly empowered Marxist government here provided support to black groups fighting the white minority government in what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. **********In response, the Rhodesian white minority government provided arms to the newly formed Renamo, which has been in the field in this country ever since, and is estimated now to have as many as 25,000 armed followers scattered throughout the country, not enough to take power, but enough to wreak havoc. **********In the war, taking place in a country without reliable transport or communications, each side has accused the other of massacres. In July, more than 380 people were reportedly killed in an attack on the village of Homoine. The Government blamed the deaths on the rebels. **********It is an article of faith in Mozambique, and in such surrounding countries as Zimbabwe and Tanzania, who have sent troops to help in the war, that support for Renamo comes from South Africa, which would appear to be the only country in the region with an interest in undermining an unfriendly neighboring government. But the Mozambican authorities have been unable to provide conclusive proof of this. **********The United States has chosen to distinguish between Renamo, which receives no direct American aid, and Unita, the major anti-Government resistance group in Angola, the other former Portuguese colony in Africa torn by civil war. Unita does receive military aid from the United States as well as South Africa. **********In the resettlement camp of Ilova, a flat, dry stretch of reed homes, Mussa Alberto Bres, who is blind, sits by the banks of the River of Good Signs and sings African songs for some visitors. **********Mr. Bres, whose village of Elalano was attacked by rebels last year, was led through the bush to safety by a friend. **********He sang mostly love songs, such as one about the man whose mistress lived in the next village. **********But there were also songs of war. In one, Mr. Bres sang, ''If the army had no bazookas or rifles, I would be dead.'' fdtx'fj"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/23/world/bacolod-journal-priests-are-targets-as-they-stand-up-for-change.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1987-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRIESTS ARE TARGETS AS THEY STAND UP FOR CHANGE", "print_headline": "BACOLOD JOURNAL; PRIESTS ARE TARGETS AS THEY STAND UP FOR CHANGE", "body_text": " **********Bishop Antonio Y. Fortich was seated in a white T-shirt eating lunch when a young priest walked up to him with a newspaper folded open to the letters column and began to read. **********''You have run out of good will in Bacolod City,'' the young priest read. ''Your credibility is zero. Your life is at stake from both right and left.'' **********The Bishop, 73 years old, paused as he raised a spoonful of rice, looked up at the priest and grunted a brief acknowledgment. **********''You have espoused liberation theology and the 'preferential option for the poor,' which is another euphemism for Marxist ideology,'' said the letter, which was addressed to him by a right-wing group. 'Don't Need You' **********The Bishop grunted again, and was joined this time, as in a liturgical response, by the other priests seated with him under a buzzing ceiling fan. **********''We don't need you as our church leader in Negros,'' the letter concluded. ''We don't want you and your Communist clergy here.'' **********Bishop Fortich finished his lunch without further comment. The letter was only the latest in many that have been seen to him and his priests in recent weeks. **********As he headed out for his nap, he passed through a small sun-baked courtyard where two weeks before a hand grenade, thrown just after midnight, landed a few feet from his bedroom, spraying shrapnel across walls, windows and doorways. Subject of Contention **********As the island of Negros, like much of the nation, moves toward a sharper confrontation between right and left, the activities of the Roman Catholic Church have come under fire. **********The Philippine church, in a nation in which 85 percent of the people are adherents, has for years taken a high-profile role in politics and social conflicts. **********In remote areas where an often abusive military can be the sole Government presence, parish priests often provide assistance in everything from medical care to the organizing of economic cooperatives. **********Now military officers, conservative plantation owners and right-wing extremists are assailing the church, while within its own ranks a debate is under way over its proper social role. Under Threat From Vigilantes **********The more energetic priests have come under threat from anti-Communist vigilante groups, and in Negros alone four churches have been set afire since March. **********Several planters on the island's sugar estates have begun to boycott church services and withhold the donations that keep their social programs alive, in protest over the priests' advocacy of land redistribution and other benefits for the poor. **********''If the church continues with its leanings, the time will come when it will have no more parishioners,'' said a member of one of the several newly formed right-wing associations in Negros, the Concerned Citizens Group to Fight Insurgency. **********''It's really bad,'' said Esteban Coscolluela, a planter who heads another group, the Negros Foundation for Peace and Democracy. ''I am very close to God, but I have not been going to mass lately.'' Divisions Are Sharpening **********He added, ''For us, priests who turn away from their work toward Communism have very weak theological backgrounds or they're sexually frustrated.'' **********The church's advocacy of social change and the role of its grass-roots Basic Christian Communities are sharpening divisions within the clergy itself. **********One Negros priest, the Rev. Ruperto Palma, who is said to have close links with the military, recently accused 35 of his colleagues on the island of being Communists. Bishop Forich took advertisements in newspapers to deny the accusation and demand a retraction. **********In Manila, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines issued a statement in January opposing the widespread membership of priests and nuns in organizations deemed to be leftist. It said it was ''inconsistent with Gospel values'' for churchmen to be involved with organizations that espouse violence or class struggle. Social Conditions Cited **********Bishop Fortich said in an interview that social conditions had driven some of his priests to sympathize and even cooperate with the rebels. Ultimately, several of them abandoned ministries for arms. **********The Bishop said he could understand the frustrations of such men over social injustices and military harassment. But he tells them: ''You are on your own. I'll pray for you. I respect the option you have chosen, but you are no longer priests.'' **********In a measure of the prominent role played by the church, Bishop Fortich headed a national committee that monitored compliance in the 60-day cease-fire with Communist rebels last winter. His secret contacts with some of the rebel priests had been among the Government's earliest peace feelers. Prodded From Vatican **********The conflict involving the church touches on larger questions about the role of the clergy in a divided nation where social disparities have fueled a Communist insurgency. **********As priests who shared the daily problems of the poor became increasingly active, prominent churchmen also joined a growing opposition to Ferdinand E. Marcos, who was ousted as President last year. **********Now the church is undergoing a period of reassessment, prodded by instructions from the Vatican to avoid partisan politics. **********According to Manila's Auxiliary Bishop, Teodoro Bacani, a ''cleansing of the ranks'' is needed to restore the church's credibility. **********Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, recently acknowledged ''conflicts among church leaders'' that had grown out of the involvement of the clergy in opposition to Mr. Marcos. **********Although calling for church neutrality, the Cardinal has openly sided with President Corazon C. Aquino both in a recent constitutional plebiscite and in the legislative elections this month. Veritas, a weekly newspaper associated with the Cardinal, published an endorsement of 10 of Mrs. Aquino's candidates shortly before the May 11 vote. Pressure for Moderation **********Other church leaders, like Bishop Fortich, point out that the hardships that affect their parishioners, which gave rise to a socially active church, have not disappeared with the change of government. **********What has changed is the increased pressure on the church to moderate its conduct. ''Nowadays if you work with the poor you're a suspect,'' he said. ''If you espouse land reform you are destabilizing the status quo. If you support human rights you're a subversive. So my problem now is, What kind of work can I do and not be called a Communist?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/07/business/home-equity-loans-studied.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Home Equity Loans Studied", "print_headline": "Home Equity Loans Studied", "body_text": " **********The Federal Reserve Board may soon order banks and thrift institutions to give consumers more information about the terms and conditions of home equity loans, Martha Seger, a Fed member, said today. **********''We definitely are committed to improving the disclosure for home equity lines of credit,'' Miss Seger told the House Banking Committee's consumer affairs subcommittee. **********She said, however, that most lenders treat borrowers fairly and that the Fed has to date received no complaints from consumers about home equity loan practices. **********She said the Fed would consider recommendations next month prepared by the agency's staff on how to improve the disclosure requirements for such loans, in which the borrower's equity in his house serves to secure the loan. **********The pledge of Fed action came as the House subcommittee began weighing draft legislation that would go further than the Fed in cracking down on home equity loan abuses. **********Representative Charles E.

In addition, world demand for commodities is far from booming. But within a pattern of reasonable balance, individual countries, whether developing or developed, are capable of generating inflation. **********Lawrence A. Veit of Brown Brothers Harriman & Company concludes that, at best, the industrial nations of the capitalist world will ''muddle through a few more quarters of deficient growth until some combination of more stimulative policies and underlying demand reignites the engines of expansion.'' **********The Brown Brothers Harriman forecast puts the growth of real gross national product for the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as a whole at 2.5 percent this year and 3.1 percent next year, with the predicted rate of inflation averaging 3.4 percent in 1987 and 4 percent in 1988. **********The gradual advance of the industrial countries would mean only modest growth for the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose combined real G.N.P. is forecast to rise by 2.5 percent in 1987 and 3 percent in 1988. **********The combined output of the non-OPEC developing countries is projected to grow at an annual rate of 4.5 percent both this year and next. But, because of extreme differences in the ''inertial'' inflation among the developing countries, and their wide spread from stringency to laxity in fiscal and monetary policies, their expected rates of inflation differ widely. **********Mexico, whose consumer price index rose by 57.8 percent in 1985 and 84.5 percent in 1986, is expected, according to Mr. Veit, to hit 110 percent in 1987 and 120 percent in 1988. Argentina, whose inflation was reined in to 81.9 percent in 1986, is forecast to climb again to a 125 percent rate in 1987 and 1988. Brazil, with inflation of 166.2 percent last year, is expected to climb to a 300 percent rate in 1987 and 1988. **********While the spread in inflation rates among O.E.C.D. countries is much narrower, wide differences are still exhibited, depending mainly on national economic policies. In 1986, the lowest inflation was in West Germany, where consumer prices dropped by two-tenths of 1 percent, and the highest was in Australia, where prices rose 9.1 percent. The overall O.E.C.D. average increase in the consumer price index was just 2.7 percent, with the United States near the bottom, at just 1.1 percent. **********The Veit analysis puts the O.E.C.D. inflation average for 1988 at 4 percent, with the United States forecast to rise by 4.5 percent. Some American economists, such as those at Salomon Brothers, are now putting it as high as 6.5 percent. **********The argument that the United States rate will shoot higher starts with the lagging effects of a cheaper dollar. Allen Sinai, chief economist of Shearson Lehman Brothers, names five effects of a lower dollar on United States inflation. **********They are: the direct effect on prices of imported goods such as autos and consumer electronics; an ''umbrella'' effect on American-made goods where competing import prices have risen; higher business costs for American companies resulting from more expensive purchases abroad; rising precious metals and commodities prices stemming from the increased purchasing power of strong-currency countries, and a strengthened American industrial sector, as the lower dollar, by stimulating exports, adds to demand-side pressures and makes it easier for businesses to pass on price increases. **********The sharp fall in the dollar this week exacerbated worries of higher domestic inflation ahead. How far the dollar falls will depend to a degree on how the Group of Five major industrial countries acts to carry out the currency agreements reached in Paris in February through central bank interventions and coordinated macroeconomic policies. **********The most important determinant of the dollar's future value may be actions on the United States budget deficit. But here the outlook is gloomy. The Congressional Budget Office this week predicted that the deficit would ease this year but grow again to nearly $200 billion next year unless Congress and the President make good their promises to stanch the red ink. They are still stalemated and prospects of a significant compromise are not bright. **********Another major cause for anticipation of higher United States inflation is the expectation of a catch-up of wages to faster-rising prices. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first half of this year, but wages rose by only 2.2 percent, so living standards went down. A new study by Olivier Jean Blanchard for the Brookings Institution made the case for some catch-up, showing that 40 percent of the upward adjustment of wages to rising prices is complete after one year and 65 percent after two years. **********But, in specific cases and time periods, there is no iron law binding wages to prices, or vice versa. The bargaining power of corporations versus organized and unorganized labor will determine the speed and degree of the wage rise. For instance, a battle between labor and management, regarded as likely to have national significance, is now being waged between the International Paper Company and the combined forces of the United Paperworkers International Union at a strikebound mill in Jay, Me. As a result of conflicts over wages and company demands for givebacks, the mill has been closed since June 16. **********That strike typifies the battle building in the United States over stepped-up inflation and who benefits or suffers from it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/10/world/worry-grows-that-korean-army-might-intervene-in-the-elections.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1987-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 846, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Worry Grows That Korean Army Might Intervene in the Elections", "print_headline": "Worry Grows That Korean Army Might Intervene in the Elections", "body_text": " **********Serious concern has been raised here that South Korea's military might step in to cancel next week's presidential election or to nullify its results if the opposition wins. **********The concern, expressed by people familiar with the South Korean military, is based on reports that elements in the army, notably those responsible for domestic surveillance, have discussed possible action. Question of Reprisals **********It is also rooted in the perception of some political analysts that the ruling-party candidate, Roh Tae Woo, is doing less well than his strategists had hoped. Should he lose, several experts said, some senior army officers are likely to fear possible reprisals from a government led by either of his major opponents, Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung.  [ In Washington, a senior State Department official warned against efforts to subvert the elections. The official, Gaston J. Sigur Jr., Assistant Secretary of State for Asian affairs, appeared to be directing the warning at the South Korean Government and military. Page A9. ]  ''There are people in this Government and ruling party who feel they cannot lose the election,'' a knowledgeable specialist in South Korean military affairs said. Army intervention, either before or after the election, ''is being discussed,'' he said. **********''Lots of these people do not have moral compunctions about doing something like this,'' he said. ''It's a practical consideration - can they get away with it?'' **********He cautioned that he was aware only that discussions were under way and did not know if any decision had been made. There have been no indications of unusual movements by the South Korean armed forces or, for that matter, evidence of action of any kind. **********The Government of President Chun Doo Hwan, which came to power through a coup by army generals in 1980, has stated several times in recent months that the military would stay out of politics. **********''The decision might be to do nothing initially, to let the opposition take over and see what they do,'' the military affairs specialist said. ''They may not have made up their minds.'' **********Several informed analysts said that if there was a move to call off the Dec. 16 election, it would probably not occur without the knowledge of Mr. Chun, who led the 1980 coup. **********It has long been taken for granted that the army worries greatly about Kim Dae Jung, whom many officers regard as a Communist sympathizer. But some analysts suggest that there is concern as well about Kim Young Sam, even though he is regarded as more moderate and has gone out of his way to reassure the army. In September, for example, he accepted a Government invitation to watch a demonstration of a new tank. **********To bolster his presidential campaign, however, Kim Young Sam recruited support from former Gen. Chung Sung Hwa, who was ousted as army chief of staff on Dec. 12, 1979, in a rebellion by the Chun group, which included Mr. Roh. The general was later reduced in rank to private and reportedly even tortured. Pledge of No Reprisals **********According to political analysts, senior army officers who aided Mr. Chun, or owe their present positions to him, worry what might happen to them if Mr. Chung was to have influence on a Kim Young Sam government. **********Campaigning today in the country's southeast, Mr. Kim pledged there would be no reprisals, a promise also made many times by Kim Dae Jung. But both men also stress the need to investigate the Chun coup and the massacre by soldiers that it produced in May 1980 in the city of Kwangju. **********Rumors of possible army intervention in South Korean political life are not uncommon, and they usually amount to nothing.

In June, at the height of street protests that led to the present presidential elections, he was reliably reported to have come close to calling in troops to maintain order, but was then persuaded to back off. **********One reason, according to some experts, was resistance in the army itself to being used that way. Most officers, it is said, firmly believe that their top priority is to defend the country against North Korea and that they have no place in domestic politics, even in the name of stability. **********Moreover, several analysts said, ordinary South Koreans would regard cancellation of the election as unjustified and would react strongly. **********Concern about jeopardizing the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul would be another consideration for the Government, as would the reaction of the United States, which has repeatedly warned against army intervention."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/12/business/finance-new-issues-goldome-sets-7-stock-price.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goldome Sets $7 Stock Price", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Goldome Sets $7 Stock Price", "body_text": " **********Goldome, the nation's eighth-largest thrift institution, is offering 13.95 million shares of common stock at $7 each, for a total of $97.6 million, according to Merrill Lynch & Company, the lead underwriter. **********The sale will raise less than half as much as the Buffalo-based savings bank expected in April when it announced the public offering.

This is the second year in a row the agency has held back $25 million from the fund because of the charge involving China. **********The agency's acting administrator, Jay F. Morris, said the decision, which had been expected for some time, was made because of strong evidence that China's policy of encouraging one child per family is coercive. He cited hundreds of Chinese radio broadcasts in which officials speak of banned second pregnancies and ''penalty measures'' for the conception of a second child. **********Chinese officials have repeatedly denied that their programs force abortions. No Evidence of Coerced Abortions **********The United Nations supports census efforts in China which may indirectly help coercive programs, Mr. Morris said. He said the Chinese census efforts gave the Beijing Government information that it might use to plan coercive family planning. **********But a top agency official said internal agency experts strongly opposed a cutoff in United States money. A 1985 report by the agency found some abuses by local Chinese officials but no evidence that China's central Government or the fund supports coerced abortions. **********Senator Daniel K.

''We are particularly concerned with the critical situation in sub-Saharan Africa'' where she said the fund ''is trying to respond to Africa's increasing demands for family planning and maternal and child health care.'' **********The agency first withheld money from the fund because of the China charge in 1985, deducting $10 million of a $46 million contribution - an amount roughly equal to the fund's spending that year in China. **********The agency witheld all $25 million of the appropriated American contribution to the fund last year, promising to spend the money on American-sponsored programs abroad. **********The fund will spend $155 million this year in 133 countries.

They called on the two superpowers to keep the European public informed on the dismantling of the bases. **********The protesters convened in a small room at the International Press Center, across from the European Community headquarters. They wore sandals and old sweaters, and some still smelled of the wood fires of their encampments. They read their reports from battered school notebooks and had to borrow coins to photocopy their final communique. Movement Started in England **********The informal movement began with a women's encampment at the Greenham Common cruise missile base in England and in five years has spread to the other countries in which American missiles are deployed, as well as to France. In most cases the participants have set up tents or bought houses just outside the bases and try to obstruct work or to monitor the military activities. Many live on welfare or unemployment payments. **********There is no central organization, but the hundreds of people in the camps often exchange information and visit each other's sites. In many cases, they have drawn thousands of protesters to their demonstrations. They have mastered the fearsome vocabulary of nuclear deterrence, know the names and, they say, the numbers of the weapons, and produce detailed reports that they give to anyone who asks. **********''We don't trust anybody,'' said Margaret Johnson, who has divided her time in the last four years between the five permanent peace camps in England and Scotland. ''We don't work with any power, but we make known what we know to everybody.'' A Variety of Factions **********The politics of the camps can be confusing to outsiders. At the Woensdrecht missile base in the Netherlands, for example, there were at one time 10 camps around the chain-link fence, for groups ranging from gay women to Roman Catholics to Quakers to draft resisters. There was even a group whose policy of puncturing the tires of military trucks separated it from the more strictly nonviolent alignments. **********Lorenzo Porto and Tulio Vaccaro, two bearded young men from the Comiso cruise missile base in Sicily, described their movement there in a mixture of French and English laced with Italian. They said they had collected money in the cities to buy land around the base so it could not be expanded, had organized demonstrations with workers in the surrounding vineyards and had taken pictures of the truck-mounted cruise missiles when they were taken on maneuvers. **********''The pictures were not very good because the caribinieri, they always run after us,'' Mr. Vaccaro said. He said he had been arrested twice on charges of espionage. **********Many of the participants said they feared the missile bases would be turned over to aircraft capable of carrying nuclear bombs or to other military uses not covered in the treaty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/04/business/company-news-chapter-11-for-air-atlanta.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " Chapter 11 For Air Atlanta", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;  Chapter 11 For Air Atlanta", "body_text": " **********Air Atlanta, the three-year-old airline that was the brainchild of a black businessman, Michael R.

Hunt, chief economist for CM&M Group in Philadelphia, and that alone is something to cheer about as the new year begins. For most of 1986, large banks held about $250 billion in short-term commercial and industrial loans, a level that reflected a weak economy. Now, says Mr. Hunt, these loans are approaching the $265 billion level. **********The rising loan level is good news. When demand for short-term funds rises, it means companies are borrowing money to pay dividends, meet payroll requirements and purchase equipment. ''It is an indicator of business activity and business confidence,'' says Mr. Hunt. **********And at least two other factors support the encouraging loan picture. ''There are signs that industrial activity is beginning to pick up, such as the rise in manufacturing employment,'' said Mr. Hunt. And inventory investment, which has undergone a dramatic liquidation since 1984, is also rising. Inventory-building is not only a sign of business confidence, it also spurs more borrowing, he says. ''Typically, increases in inventory investment lead to higher credit demands.'' Foreigners Phone Toll-Free **********About 400 companies worldwide offer toll-free calls for customers. ''And the number has been rising by about 20 percent a month,'' said Robert K. Baulch, manager of international marketing for A.T.&T., which sells the global service to about 120 American companies. Right now, phone companies in 15 countries offer international toll-free calling to customers in those nations. By the end of 1987, 10 more countries in Asia, Europe and South America will join that list. **********But, at $1.60 a call, reaching new customers around the world is not an inexpensive proposition for American companies, even though, according to Mr. Baulch, toll-free service can increase a customer's willingness to call sevenfold. The key industries involved - catalogue, travel and services businesses -will also have to make some changes in the way they do business, he says. Companies, for example, will have to set up operations to receive calls at all hours of the day - in a dozen languages. Shipping From a Tiny Isle **********Because of new laws and favorable taxation - no corporate tax, no estate duty, no capital gains tax and a mere 20 percent personal income tax - the Isle of Man, off the coast of England in the Irish Sea, is competing with the Netherlands, West Germany and the United States to become a major world shipping center. **********The isle now has 40 ships registered. But it is not stopping there. ''In the next 12 months there will probably be 100 ships on the registry,'' predicts Capt. Geoffrey Davis, chief marine surveyor for the isle.  So far, the Isle of Man has been luring shipping companies from elsewhere in Britain. That's because crews cost 30 percent less to hire on the isle and office expenses are 50 percent lower there. But because registration fees on the isle are also low, shipping companies from other countries may start to set up headquarters on the tiny island. Captain Davis says, however, that unlike Liberia and Panama, the Isle of Man is ''not a flag-of-convenience registry.'' Shipping safety-and-health standards will be high, he says, and rigorously enforced. False Teeth That Fit **********An estimated 30 million Americans have no teeth in one or both jaws, and about 10 percent of them cannot wear dentures for either physical or psychological reasons, says Craig Rodriguez, vice president of Nobelpharma USA, an American subsidiary of Swedish Nobel Industries. **********Now, he says, some of these people may have something to smile about: a 20-year-old Swedish technique called the Biotes process. The technique, which has the approval of the Food and Drug Administration and the provisional blessing of the American Dental Association, has now been tested on 9,000 Americans. **********The process uses three screws. The first is surgically screwed into the jawbone. It is made of titanium, and thus integrates with the bone to form ''an irreversible bond,'' said Mr. Rodriguez. A second is screwed on top of the first so that it comes up to the gum line. A third holds the tooth in place. This tooth can be used as an anchor to hold a bridge or a complete denture. The final screw can be removed if the tooth or denture needs to be replaced. The cost of an upper or lower denture created with this process is about $8,000, but, says Mr. Rodriquez, ''it may last 20 years or more.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/12/world/the-un-today-feb-12-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Sometimes, if they pick you up, they bend your ear with their right-wing views. Occasionally they spray you with tear gas. And now they propose to electrify you. **********Parisian taxi drivers, in search of protection against thieves and muggers, have come up with the ''blazing seat,'' an electric cushion slipped under the passenger seat, attached to a powerful battery. At the touch of a button, the Israeli-made device delivers 52,000 volts of low-tension electric current to the back of the spine. It works. **********''I just shot straight up and let out a tremendous yell,'' said Jon Silverman, a Paris-based correspondent who asked to try it out a few days ago for a BBC report. ''Gave myself a terrific bruise on the shin when my head hit the front seat as I jumped up to escape the shock. I don't think it's a good idea.'' **********The device is slightly more powerful than the police weapon known as the stun gun, which delivers about 40,000 to 50,000 volts. Drivers' Union to Install Device **********If it has its way, a Parisian taxi drivers' union proposes to install the device, which costs about $1,100, in most of the 14,300 cabs of the city. Already five taxis are equipped with it. The supplier, Lucien Cornescu, who represents a company called Recomex, says another 1,000 devices are on order. **********The hot seat's main champion, Norbert Ben-Arous, the secretary general of an organization representing the owners of about 20 percent of Parisian taxis, says the project is forging ahead.''In France anything that is not forbidden is allowed,'' he said today after emerging, slightly pale, from a live demonstration for the world press at the Place de la Concorde. **********Aides to Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, who is also Mayor of Paris, privately ridiculed the idea. The police are skeptical. Some medical authorities, asked to assess the dangers of the device, have certified it will not kill cardiac patients. **********''In France anything that is not forbidden is allowed,'' he said today after emerging, slightly pale, from a live demonstration for the world press at the Place de la Concorde. **********Spurred on by the murder two weekends ago of a woman who drove a cab, drivers insist they need stronger protection. But judging from the litany of horror stories Parisians tell of their daily duel with taxi drivers, this view is not widely shared. **********Complaints range from the common impression that most drivers spend much of their time going home - routinely dismissing a fare because ''it's not on my way'' - to the many times a customer is curtly told, ''There are no cars, call later,'' after a 15-minute wait on the phone for a radio-dispatched taxi. It is not uncommon to see taxis parked at bistros during rush hours as drivers enjoy a leisurely meal. **********Even if the indifference can be digested, uglier behavior shocks. **********An American passenger was left 50 feet from her hotel the other day, and her suitcases deposited on the sidewalk, so the driver could respond to a radio call for a more lucrative fare. **********In another case, a driver's dog - a common phenomenon in the front seat - assaulted a French passenger, Jean-Francois Kahn, as he reached past the muzzle to pay the fare. And Patrice de Nussac, a French journalist, says he watched a friend take a beating from a gang of taxi drivers when he asked one of them to move his double-parked taxi on the Champs-Elysees. **********Parisian drivers are also known to spray passengers with the ever-present bottle of tear gas at the slightest provocation. **********And pettiness abounds. Take the no smoking signs that some cabbies insist apply only to passengers, not drivers, or the prohibition on rolling down windows. For riders of African or Arab origin, it is common to be ignored and occasionally struck with a racist epithet as the taxi rolls by. **********To be sure, taxi drivers have their own complaints. Fares are low. Taxes are high. Noise is incessant. People take taxis when they should walk, they say. ''The traffic is awful,'' complained Paul de Angelis, the son of a taxi driver who has driven a Parisian cab himself for 17 years ''A few years ago I could take in as much as 30 fares a day. Today I average 13 to 15.'' **********Above all there is the danger, Mr. Ben-Arous says, and the police confirm that some 40 assaults on taxi drivers are reported each month. The recent killing was the 19th of a taxi driver since 1979. ''We are not like sheep, waiting to be slaughtered,'' Mr. Ben-Arous said.  [ In New York, according to the Taxi and Limousine Commission, there were about 260 robberies of cab drivers a month in 1986 and 1987, and there have been 10 killings so far this year. The commission chairman, Gorman Gilbert, said the use of the electric-seat device in New York would require commission approval. He did not say whether such approval would be likely. ]  Mr. Chirac's staff in City Hall says there are other ways to protect drivers. One is a bulletproof bubble installed around the driver, and another is a safe deposit box in which the money can be locked, or a communications systems that connects the taxi to a police station. It was even suggested that riders buy an electronic credit card and pay with it. **********Predictably, drivers say none of the proposed alternatives is any good. ''Most turned down the bubble, even though we offered to subsidize it,'' said Jean-Pierre Richer, the traffic director at the Paris police. ''They like to gossip with the clients. It helps with the tip.'' Instead, the taxi drivers want subsidies to purchase the hot seat. **********What about accidental use or angry drivers settling even simple arguments by sending some ''juice,'' as Mr. de Angelis calls the electric current, to the back seat? **********''No way,'' Mr. Ben-Arous said. The device has a three-step trigger mechanism. A driver turns it on with a button, arms it with another and triggers it with a third. It unlocks in case of an accident. Besides, taxi drivers ''can tell when a guy has bad intentions,'' he argued. ''Good family men have nothing to worry about.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/business/brady-cites-overvalued-stocks.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1987-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 794, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brady Cites Overvalued Stocks", "print_headline": "Brady Cites Overvalued Stocks", "body_text": " **********Nicholas F.

Got Call Thursday Afternoon **********Mr. Brady said he had received a call on Thursday afternoon from Howard H. Baker Jr., the White House chief of staff, asking him to take on the investigation. He plans to arrive in Washington Monday to meet with Mr. Baker to determine how the task force will operate and who its other two members will be. **********President Reagan announced the creation of the task force Thursday evening in a televised news conference, saying he wanted its recommendations within 30 to 60 days on any changes that might be necessary in stock market operations. **********Mr. Brady, who is chairman of Dillon, Read & Company, a Wall Street investment firm, said that he expected the panel to be interviewing a number of market experts and specialists and that no decision had been made yet on whether the task force would work out of Washington or out of New York.

''To me, the underlying economic conditions are fine,'' Mr. Brady said, noting Government reports released today that showed the economy grew by 3.8 percent in the third quarter and that inflation remains moderate. **********Mr. Brady said that he does not expect the task force to deal with the economic situation, but rather to examine technological changes in the operation of the stock market, the globalization of securities markets and the new types of trading instruments that have been developed in the last 10 years. **********''It may well be that the conclusion is that in a world of electronic and technological advances, when people come to the same conclusions all at once, you've got a lot of problems on your hands,'' he said. ''You may need some system for slowing it all down or for helping people to understand that nothing is dramatically wrong.'' Thoughts, Not Conclusions **********Mr. Brady emphasized that these were general thoughts, not conclusions. He said his first job would be to organize a staff and then to collect and analyze the data on stock market operations, adding that he saw no difficulty in completing the job within 60 days. **********Asked if he believed the task force had been given a mandate to soothe the public's concerns about the stock market gyrations, Mr. Brady said that he would be happy if this was an offshoot of the panel's work but that he did not view it as an end in itself. ''Calmness is built from understanding,'' he said. ''The worst part of any sickness is the hour you spend waiting in the doctor's office thinking about how the world might end.'' **********Mr. Brady said it was hard to envision what types of recommendations the panel might make without knowing yet what its members would find, but when pressed for the types of things that might emerge, he said that, for example, if the panel concluded that market volatility was the result of so many players simultaneously making the same trading decisions, one possibility might be to recommend building more liquidity into the system. **********''We are in a financial world and we are talking about money,'' he said. ''When you are talking about a 1,000-point drop in the market in a very short period of time, I don't think any kind of general solution would necessarily impress anybody.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/17/business/us-japan-chip-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 191, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S.-Japan Chip Pact", "print_headline": "U.S.-Japan Chip Pact", "body_text": " **********The European Community is to ask the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to set up a panel to examine a trade accord on computer chips between the United States and Japan, a European Community spokesman said.

The important thing, said David Smith, managing director of the New York office of Korn/Ferry International, an executive-search firm, is ''to heed warnings and come up with options to a number of 'what if' scenarios.'' **********Before Howard Glassroth was told that he was going to lose his position as associate director of corporate communications at Standard Oil Company of Ohio, he quietly let outside contacts know that he was in the market for a job. ''I stopped short of a formal job search because I didn't know whether or how soon my job would be eliminated,'' Mr. Glassroth said. ''But the informal calls got me in the habit of doing something I'd neglected - staying plugged into community and professional networks, which are essential once you're let go.'' **********When British Petroleum, Standard Oil's major shareholder, replaced Standard's top management, Mr. Glassroth saw the handwriting on the wall, which is the first step to surviving a transition, according to experts. ''People think, 'It can't happen to me because my job or department is too valuable,' and waste time when they could be developing new skills or starting a job search,'' said Prof. Ralph Kilmann, director of the program in corporate culture at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Business. **********Executives who learn that a change is imminent should lobby for either a golden parachute, a contract that insures future income for a specified time if a company's ownership changes, or guaranteed severance pay, according to John D. Erdlen, president of Management Dimensions Inc., an outplacement and career-counseling firm in Wellesley, Mass. Key players in the company who are not part of management can also negotiate deals if they take the initiative. ''Both can take advantage of management's fear that the good performers will leave before they're ready to have them leave,'' he said. **********Company management is often secretive about impending changes, but the rumor mill is full of valuable information if you know how to sort it out, according to Prof. Robert J. Bies at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, who has studied how managers deliver bad news. ''Decide if the sources are reliable, what the common themes of the rumors are and then look for evidence that supports what you hear, including what you read in the newspaper,'' said Professor Bies. Bosses often put off delivering bad news, so if you get a signal that jobs in your department may be in jeopardy, the best survival response is to ask for a clarification so that you can take steps to preserve yours or find a new position. **********Making sure that those who have power over your job fate know who you are, what you've done and what you can do for the company is a smart move, say outplacement counselors. One way to do this is by giving your manager an up-to-date resume that reflects your contributions and experience at the company. You might want to include letters of recognition from clients, articles that have appeared in trade journals about your accomplishments and outstanding performance appraisals, Mr. Erdlen suggested. Another avenue is to introduce yourself to managers on the transition team and give them a copy of your internal resume. **********An option for those who work for a large company is to investigate transfer possibilities. When Ken Washburn learned that the textbook college publisher he worked for was being merged with another division, he called managers at the parent company who knew him and asked them to keep their eyes open for other positions he might transfer into. ''I knew there would be a lot of duplication of effort, and I also realized that our division was being subsumed by the other, which meant their people would get first consideration,'' Mr. Washburn said. In the end he wasn't asked to relocate or leave since there were enough colleges in the Boston area to support two sales representatives.Priorities Change **********Sometimes no matter how valuable an employee has been to an organization, he finds himself out of a job because management's objectives and priorities are different. When CBS made its first staff reductions in September 1985, Robert Ferrante, a news producer, was given a day to vacate his office. ''I wasn't surprised because I knew there was fat in the news operation, especially my area, special events,'' he said. ''Despite that, I hadn't been out looking because I wasn't under pressure to find a job.'' Taking time off to evaluate the direction of your career is a good idea if you have a financial cushion, experts say. Since Mr. Ferrante's contract was still in effect for six months, he began to ponder his 28 years in broadcasting. ''The fact that a technology-intensive field like mine means fewer and fewer people are needed to do the job became clear to me,'' Mr. Ferrante said. ''And I decided to let people know that I wanted to consider job options in the communications field outside of broadcasting.'' A year after he left CBS, Mr. Ferrante became director of communications for the Democratic National Committee. **********While financial support from a former employer in the form of a contract or severance pay takes the pressure off accepting the first job offer that comes along, emotional support from family, friends and former colleagues makes a big difference in how psychologically smooth the transition is. ''I was surprised by who came to my rescue and who didn't,'' Mr. Glassroth said. ''My family and broadcasting colleagues I hadn't seen in years were terrific, but my coworkers at Standard Oil wouldn't even return my calls. It was as if I had a disease they were afraid of catching.'' **********Nonetheless, Mr. Glassroth optimistically pursued his job hunt and a master of business administration program for executives. Within two months of his departure, he was offered two positions. He turned down one because it involved a relocation, and took the second, which was a better position with a higher salary than his previous position, only to be told 48 hours after accepting it that the company was being sold. Now, almost a year later, he is still without a job. ''The longer you look, the more important emotional support becomes,'' he said. **********The people most likely to survive a merger or reorganization are those who are adaptable. ''A willingness to accept a lower salary or take on new responsibilities can make the difference of whether you're kept on,'' said Professor Kilmann. ''For those who are let go, a willingness to relocate, learn new skills or consider related job fields increases their chances of finding a new position.'' **********Mr. Washburn is glad he weathered the merger of his publishing company. ''It wasn't easy because we all had to accept new ways of doing things,'' he said. Now his line of books has expanded and so have his sales. ''I feel more secure than I ever have,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/25/world/slain-diplomat-s-wife-says-french-ignored-lead.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1987-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 577, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Slain Diplomat's Wife Says French Ignored Lead", "print_headline": "Slain Diplomat's Wife Says French Ignored Lead", "body_text": " **********The wife of an American military attache who was slain here in 1982 testified today that she had given the French police a lead in the case that they failed to pursue. **********The woman, Sharon Ray, testified at the trial of Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, who is considered a founder and leader of a terrorist group called the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction.

Change in Psychiatric Hospitals **********He noted in an interview that the Soviet authorities announced several weeks ago that psychiatric hospitals now under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is also in charge of the police, were being transferred to the Ministry of Health, where they may be less useful for incarcerating dissidents. **********But Mr. Schifter added that the Russians had made no commitment to increase the rate of emigration, which is severely restricted for all Soviet citizens. Since the early 1970's, however, some Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans have been permitted to leave. **********Beginning in April, about 800 Jews have been permitted to leave each month, more than during recent years but considerably fewer than the 51,000 who left at the peak of emigration in 1979. **********The issue has enormous weight in Soviet-American relations. It was raised this week by both President Reagan and Secretary State George P. Shultz during their talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Washington. Detailed discussions were held by a special Soviet-American working group on human rights, led by Mr. Schifter and Yuri Reshetov, a deputy director of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's department of humanitarian and cultural affairs. **********Rights organizations are planning large demonstrations for the expected visit here by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, later this year for a meeting with Mr. Reagan. Signs of improvement in the rights field, such as those provided this week and some gestures expected in the cases of a few prominent individuals, are seen by American officials as part of a Soviet effort to defuse the protest. **********Mr. Schifter and others in the State Department regard the Soviet steps as part of a mixed picture. **********''You can see both the movement and the limits of the movement,'' Mr. Schifter said. ''They're going to take certain steps that will significantly ameliorate conditions without in any way changing the fundamental Leninist structure of the state.'' **********For example, Mr. Schifter reported, Soviet officials said that in their current revision of the criminal code, they were considering a repeal of a law on ''anti-Soviet defamation,'' which has often been used against dissidents. An amnesty might also be given those serving sentences under that law. **********But a harsher measure, providing a maximum sentence of seven years in prison and five in exile for ''anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda,'' would stay on the books, Mr. Schifter was told. **********Soviet officials also predicted that other statutes would be eased. **********''The impression we were left with is that they are going to relax on the code sections which make it a crime to engage in unauthorized religious activity,'' Mr. Schifter said. ''They may amend the criminal code and may grant amnesty to people convicted under these sections.'' **********The Soviet authorities have long used psychiatric hospitals to imprison political dissidents and complaining workers, but Mr. Schifter said, ''I was left with the feeling that that was really moving.'' **********He said he had told Soviet officials that he hoped that ''sluggish schizophrenia,'' an all-purpose diagnosis used to incarcerate dissidents, would be stricken from the list of diseases. **********Soviet officials indicated that changes were coming in the emigration procedures, he said. **********Would-be emigres are often refused exit visas because they are deemed to possess state secrets or because a relative who is staying behind declines to sign a statement of permission. The authorities were blocking the departure of one man and his family because his daughter-in-law's mother refused to let her leave, Mr. Schifter said. **********''They indicated that there may be a relaxation in the veto power of relatives,'' he said. **********''One area I believe there will be movement,'' he added, ''is in the area of secrecy determination.'' The Soviet authorities have so broad a definition of secrecy that one man, for instance, was turned down because he had built swimming pools for army officers' clubs. **********But Mr. Schifter said a review commission recently established in the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet seemed to give some hope of progress in this regard. Soviet officials told him that the commission had reversed visa denials in 12 cases, and that many of the broad secrecy decisions were being made by over-zealous, lower-level bureaucrats. **********Foreign Minister Shevardnadze also alluded to this in his news conference Friday, when he said: ''The fact that this commission has to do a great deal of work means that we do have some bureaucrats remaining. However, my partners here in America have agreed that bureaucrats also exist in this country.'' **********Mr. Schifter said Soviet officials had not addressed restrictions built into a new emigration law that went into effect this year. The measure limits emigration to those with immediate family members abroad, which human rights campaigners estimate eliminates about 90 percent of the Jews who have expressed an interest in leaving. **********The Soviet authorities are reviewing cases of those previously refused exit visas, and Mr. Schifter said an average of 80 percent of the 800 Jews who are leaving each month fall into that category. Only 20 percent are new applicants, raising fears among American officials that once the estimated 10,000 to 11,000 ''refuseniks'' are processed, most new applicants will be refused and emigration will again fall to a trickle."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/24/business/us-acquisition-sought-by-veba.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Acquisition Sought by Veba", "print_headline": "U.S. Acquisition Sought by Veba", "body_text": " **********Veba A.G., the energy and chemicals group that is West Germany's second-largest company, is looking for an acquisition in the United States, Rudolf von Bennigsen-Foerder, the concern's chairman, said.

The giant Merrill Lynch & Company is selling around $34 and had been lower in the wake of its quarter-billion-dollar trading loss in mortgage securities; its 52-week high was $46.75. Some brokerage stocks are now selling at considerbly less than two times their book value. **********Such sad stock performance, in a market that despite the current doldrums is still up substantially this year, has led some experts to wonder if some publicly traded brokerage houses will soon become takeover targets. Ironies abound in this situation. For one thing, many investment houses have been the beneficiaries of the fees, commissions and trading profits from the recent merger mania. Merrill Lynch, for one, has been carving out a profitable niche in leveraged buyouts. **********For another, the expansion programs undertaken by many big American firms are designed to make them more competitive with the aggressive Japanese firms, which are making big inroads in New York and London. Yet those ambitious expansions weaken stock prices, making the American houses vulnerable to takeovers - by the Japanese, as well as by some big European banks. **********According to Lawrence W. Eckenfelder, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities in San Francisco, the names most mentioned as potential takeover targets are Paine Webber Inc. and E. F. Hutton & Company. At about $29.50 a share, Paine Webber is about $10 below its 52-week high and is selling at 1.25 times book value. Hutton, at about $36.50, is way below its high of $52.25 and is selling at 1.4 times book. Such prices may lure a buyer, some experts believe. ''A reasonably profitable, well-positioned broker,'' Mr. Eckenfelder noted, should be selling ''at two and a half or three times book.'' **********Still, he said that rumors about Paine Webber and Hutton have been floating around for six years, and nothing much has happened. He added, though, that there had been some recent sniffing at Hutton. ''I heard that Chrysler Credit at least took a look at Hutton, and Transamerica, I know, looked at Hutton,'' the Prudential-Bache analyst said. **********There is little doubt that Wall Street's firms are attractive to foreign and American investors alike. The Nippon Life Insurance Company owns a big chunk of Shearson; the Sumitomo Bank has part of Goldman, Sachs; Europeans have stakes in Drexel Burnham Lambert and the First Boston Corporation. Domestically, the Primerica Corporation's plan to buy Smith Barney, Harris Upham for $750 million, which was announced this week, is only the latest example of a large American company buying a Wall Street firm to expand into financial services. Sears, Roebuck has Dean Witter Reynolds; Travelers has Dillon, Read, and General Electric owns 80 percent of Kidder, Peabody. **********Foreign companies like American investment houses for the entree they can provide in this country. Domestic buyers, such as G.E., snap up Wall Street firms to diversify into financial services. **********And despite the shortcomings of some individual companies, the brokerage industry turned in admirable results last year. According to the Securities Industry Association, pretax net income for the industry in 1986 was $5.51 billion, a 33.1 percent gain from 1985. **********In addition to Paine Webber and Hutton, a few other Wall Street firms are grist for the takeover rumor mill. Merrill Lynch's name, for example, pops up frequently, although Mr. Eckenfelder estimated that, with 105.6 million shares outstanding, Merrill could cost an acquirer up to $6 billion. **********Another firm that has been mentioned is Bear, Stearns & Company, now trading for about $16.50 a share. A official of the firm said that a complete takeover was unlikely, because management controls much of the stock. Yet, he thinks there may be some action. ''A takeover would be too complicated,'' according to this source, who asked not to be identified. ''But Bear, Stearns is very primed for an equity infusion from the Japanese.'' **********One firm that several experts mentioned is L. F. Rothschild Inc., which has been undergoing a management shake-up. At about $12.50 a share, Rothschild is actually selling below its $12.80 book value, Mr. Eckenfelder noted. He said he had not heard ''any rumors'' about the firm, but ''it has 250 retail brokers,'' is strong in the capital markets and has an international presence. Rothschild ''is not a major force,'' he said, but if an acquirer were to pay two times book, it would get a respected firm for only about $400 million. **********Perrin Long, who follows the industry for Lipper Analytical Services, does not see that happening. ''The new management wants the opportunity to show what it can do,'' he said, adding that ''unless the price was tremendous,'' the company would fight a takeover tooth and nail. **********Mr. Long said he had not picked up any hints that any brokerages might be acquired. ''I don't think anyone is going to take over Merrill,'' he said. Not that brokerage stocks will be immune to the speculation. ''A. G.

But member states refused, maintaining that interest on the debt would increase the organization's costs. U.S. Budget Efforts **********Some United Nations officials said they suspected that the member nations also did not want to increase the organization's financial independence. **********The United States is by far the largest United Nations debtor, owing $342 million. It is behind on its payments for this year and last year because of Congressional mistrust of the United Nations and efforts to cut the Federal deficit. **********The Secretary General noted that the United States has promised to pay $90 million this month toward the roughly $200 million it owes for this year. **********Most of the other countries in arrears have not paid due to financial difficulties. The Soviet Union recently agreed to pay its total debt to the United Nations, about $250 million. Report Cites Spending Cut **********Without more income, he predicted that the United Nations would run out of money next August. He estimated that expenditures would exceed income by $37.4 million in the third quarter of 1988 and by $72.6 million in the final quarter. **********In his report he said spending had been cut by 7.8 percent this year and that savings would exceed the target of $146 million. The biggest part of these savings have come through cuts in salaries and staff expenses, he said, including a recruitment freeze, deferral of cost-of-living adjustments and reductions in overtime, travel and the use of consultants. **********Last month member countries owed $279.2 million, or 36.9 percent, of the United Nations headquarters budget of $756 million for this year. Together with arrears of $177.2 million from previous years, the organization is now owed $456.4 million. The headquarters budget pays for New York operations. **********The report said that only 66 of the 159 member states had paid their entire contribution to the United Nations. Of the 93 members in arrears, 44 owe more than their 1987 assessment, 7 owe an amount equal to the contribution due this year and 42 owe less."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/05/business/l-losing-markets-869887.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Losing Markets", "print_headline": "Losing Markets", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********''Losing a Market to a High-Wage Nation,'' (Forum, June 14) is only partly right in its explanation as to why German textile machinery manufacturers have beaten us in the competition for leadership of the international textile machinery market.

Potatoes and oranges lie under a nearby aluminum stand where at lunchtime two cooks with iridescent red hair whip up a tolerable pasta and salad. **********The conference starts punctually at 10:30 with an outside journalist giving a critique of that day's ''Taz'' (pronounced tots), as the organ of West Germany's counterculture is known. Self-criticism is a lively and even turbulent tradition at a publishing commune that started in 1979 as a vociferous champion of various leftist causes but has lately mellowed and, some say, gone professional. **********With maturity has come a considerable resonance beyond its core readership of university students. Just as the once-disruptive Green Party has slowly worked its way into the fringes of the West German power structure, so the Green-friendly Taz claims a growing clientele of lawyers, doctors and other professional people and it is not infrequently quoted in the establishment press. **********There is no hierarchy at the Taz -everyone from the cook to the newly appointed business editor gets the same $775 a month - and no one was really in charge of today's meeting of two dozen editors and reporters in their 20's and 30's. The thrust of a local radio journalist's criticism was that the Taz's Monday news pages were pretty similar to those of other dailies. A Point About Coverage **********As the agenda drifted to new business, Imma Harms, whose interests make her roughly the science editor, interrupted, wanting to know why the arrest of the leadership of the French terrorist group Direct Action was not on the front page. She made her point several times during the meeting, concluding, ''I would suggest that those of us who are interested should form a group and talk about it.'' **********It is a fair bet that the Direct Action arrests would have been given a lot bigger play had they broken in the Taz's infant years. For the newspaper emerged from the angry, fearful and disoriented mood of the West German far left as it was recovering from the crushing of the Red Army Faction terrorist group in 1978; the moral line at the time between ''resistance'' and violence was often a blurry one. **********A meridian was thus crossed last November when the Taz splashed across its front page an open letter to the Red Army Faction written by the brothers of Gerold von Braunmuhl, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official assassinated by the terrorist group outside his home in Bonn. **********The letter rebutted the Marxist-Leninist jargon of the terrorist group's communique justifying Mr. von Braunmuhl's assassination, ending: ''Stop. Come back. Have the courage to reconsider your murderous intellectual apparatus. Your arguments don't find their targets -only your bullets do. You have done the most horrible and senseless thing.'' Letters Are Mostly Approving **********In response, the Taz was inundated by letters from readers and - suggestive of a shift in sentiment on the West German left - they mostly approved of the newspaper's decision to print the statement in big type on the front page. **********In the hallways of the Taz's cluttered offices, various editors and reporters acknowledged that the paper had lately taken a more detached attitude toward the left - a small step toward a more professional kind of journalism. ''A committed journalism assumes a state of innocence,'' commented Antje Bauer, who handles news about Europe. ''But today we see it's not possible to present things as simply as one once did.'' **********The newspaper's coverage of the Middle East remains openly sympathetic to the Palestine Liberation Organization. And the picture of America painted in the Taz is still a highly critical one; in a recently published interview an East German scientist argued the case for the charge that the AIDS virus was developed by military researchers in the United States. **********''We all love New York and San Francisco,'' observed Kuno Kruse, one of the seven remaining ''founding father'' journalists still on the Taz's staff of 170. ''But Washington is our political foe.'' East Germany Is Unfriendly **********The Taz has correspondents in Moscow, Paris, London, Johannesburg, Jerusalem, Rome and Madrid, but the East German Communist authorities just across the Berlin wall have refused to accredit anyone from the paper. The newspaper has long been a stout supporter of dissident groups inside East Germany. **********The Taz now sells 60,000 copies across West Germany. Two years ago, the newspaper's circulation had dipped dangerously, but a fresher layout and its aggressive coverage of the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe and the AIDS epidemic have revived sales. **********The Taz's egalitarian salary structure enables it to survive with only 10 percent of its costs covered by advertising, but established publications that pay two or three times as much regularly steal star reporters. There seems, though, to be no shortage of young journalists attracted by the enormous freedom that goes with writing for the Taz. **********''If I write an article, no one can change its tendency,'' said Mr. Kruse. ''But over the years a lot of people have themselves changed and the paper has changed with them. But not because anyone has ordered that the line should change.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/16/world/russians-see-moscow-vs-washington-on-tv.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1987-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 548, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russians See Moscow Vs.

They heard a brief but pointed account of the use of psychiatric hospitals to punish political nonconformists. **********''We all know perfectly well that for most of this century the Soviet Union has been a hell for human rights,'' declared Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, in remarks the Soviet interpreter failed to translate until they had been repeated a third time.

Eastern time Wednesday night in the United States by ABC News. **********Despite the early hour, the broadcast was publicized in the newspapers and on the prime-time newscast and it was hard to find anyone in Moscow who had not watched it. **********The exchange was shown here along with American commercials, public service announcements on alcoholism and teen-age drug abuse, and previews of soap operas, which, though untranslated, provided Soviet viewers with a dazzling glimpse of American wealth and a reassuring hint of social ills. **********Many Soviet viewers interviewed today were clearly startled and discomfited by the public airing of their isolation from the Western world. Growing Soviet Self-Confidence **********The decision to broadcast the exchange live and uncut seemed to reflect a growing self-confidence on the part of the Soviet Union concerning its handling of human-rights issues, a sense that it has found a reasonably presentable case after years of simply refusing to discuss its domestic affairs. **********The Soviet approach now is to admit some abuses, insist that they are gradually being corrected, and steer the conversation to what Soviet citizens would consider shortcomings in American society - unemployment, homelessness and social inequality. **********The discussion was preceded by two films prepared by ABC News and Soviet television. The Soviet film stressed constitutional rights and cited American social ills. The ABC film included a short clip of Yuri Orlov, the emigre human-rights campaigner, urging Soviet citizens, in Russian, not to be afraid of ''more radical reforms,'' and of Lev Timofeyev, a former political prisoner, warning that ''glasnost'' rests on ''the nice words'' of the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********As soon as the film was over, Soviet officials announced that two longtime Jewish dissidents mentioned in it, Natan and Etya Tkach, were free to leave."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/23/business/few-new-airlines-survive.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1987-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 927, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Few New Airlines Survive", "print_headline": "Few New Airlines Survive", "body_text": " **********When the airline industry was deregulated in 1978, the unfettered market was expected to give rise to scores of low-cost carriers that would create a bonanza for consumers, put the existing companies on the defensive and even run some of them out of business. **********But things have not turned out that way at all. In most cases, it has been the upstarts that failed. And despite mergers that did away with such old-line carriers as National and Republic, many of the remaining airlines have become more powerful than ever. **********Consumers, meanwhile, have been left with fewer choices and higher rates on some routes. In many cases, nonstop flights are no longer available. In the deregulated environment, airlines have concentrated on high-volume cities, and many routes are now served by only one or two major carriers, which has often resulted in higher fares. **********Indeed, thanks to mergers and the disappearance of so many upstart carriers, the large, established airlines now control more than 90 percent of the traffic. Door Is Shut **********Indeed, there has been such a high failure rate among young carriers -including Air One, People Express and McClain Airlines - that many in the industry believe the door to new entries is virtually shut. **********Only two upstart airlines of any size remain, America West and Midway, and they see little prospect of others joining them. **********''I cannot envision a business plan or strategy that would get people to invest in a startup,'' said Michael J. Conway, chairman and chief operating officer of America West, which has its main hub and headquarters in Phoenix and a smaller hub in Las Vegas, Nev. **********Julius Maldutis, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said investors had become leery of putting up money for new airlines because of their abysmal record. 'No Way' **********To start a new airline now would take about $100 million, he said. ''Can you see venture capitalists throwing in $100 million?'' he asked. ''No way.'' **********Virtually all major airports are now dominated by one or two airlines. Because they control most gates and the most desirable landing times, there is very little room for a new competitor to enter the business. **********''Every major city is hubbed, every gate is used, every ticket counter is occupied, and no one wants to give anything to anybody,'' David R. Hinson, chairman of Midway, said. ''We don't want anybody else to play.'' **********The surviving upstarts generally try to avoid battles over pricing and service with the major carriers -many of whom have slashed their operating costs. Avoiding Conflict **********''We've been successful by avoiding conflicts,'' Mr. Conway of America West said. ''You don't get into a slugging match with airlines that are developed.'' **********His airline has concentrated on markets that the big carriers have overlooked or rejected. For example, America West provides the only nonstop service between Phoenix and the Baltimore-Washington area. **********When America West has had to contend with a major carrier, the going has been rough. For instance, it formerly had to use one of American Airlines' gates at Los Angeles airport. That meant America West planes sometimes had to stand in line waiting while American's crews gave their own planes priority. **********Even if a new airline can put together the financing, lease a few planes and find a suitable airport, its chances of surviving its early years are slim. Startup Period Shortened **********Alfred S. Altschul, vice president of finance at Midway Airlines, which is based in Chicago and flies mostly to the East and South, recalled that in the early days of deregulation, new carriers had two to three years to gain a foothold, before large carriers reacted to the competitive threat. **********The upstarts in those days had lower operating costs and could often undercut the fares charged by the largely unionized big carriers. **********Now, however, many of the big airlines have reduced their costs through two-tier wage structures and by using more efficient aircraft. **********Meanwhile, Midway's pilots have been organized by the Air Line Pilots Association and last week its flight attendants voted to be represented by the Association of Flight Attendants, despite determined opposition from management. Big Airlines Fight Back **********The major carriers are now quick to respond when an upstart challenges them in an important market. Indeed, they have mastered the art of selling just enough discount tickets to keep their seats filled, while getting higher prices for the rest. **********Mr. Altshul estimates that an upstart would need a fleet of about 20 planes to quickly establish a network around a hub from which it could offer competitive service. **********Given this scenario, it is hardly surprising that many industry experts saw the end of People Express -which was absorbed early this year by Continental, a subsidiary of the Texas Air Corporation - as the end of an era. **********This year, the large airlines demonstrated their strength by pushing through a series of fare increases. Even Continental, the low-cost carrier that had so often acted as the spoiler in recent years when others tried to raise their prices, has changed with the times. In recent months, Continental has initiated or supported fare increases."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/17/business/company-news-american-airlines-sues-texas-air.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Airlines Sues Texas Air", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; American Airlines Sues Texas Air", "body_text": " **********American Airlines has filed a lawsuit charging the Texas Air Corporation with offering illegal tactics to persuade travel agencies to switch to Texas Air's computer reservation systems.

Quest for Differentiation **********In this environment, the suppliers are hustling to differentiate themselves, either by the breadth of applications of their machines or by their price/performance ratio, with boasts such as one-fourth the performance of a Cray for one-tenth the price. **********One company banking on maximum applicability is Convex of Richardson, Tex., which has an arsenal of more than 100 software programs written for its machines by other companies. Convex introduced the first stand-alone mini-super in 1984, basing it on the design architecture of the Cray supercomputer. That architecture employs vector processing, which permits an array of data to be handled simultaneously, resulting in much faster execution than the step-by-step approach of conventional computers. **********Although a Convex machine cannot run programs written for the Cray, the similarity of architecture makes it easy to adapt the software, according to Robert Paluck, Convex's president and chief executive officer. (A San Diego-based company, Scientific Computer Systems, actually offers a mini-super that can run Cray programs unmodified, prompting analysts to call the machine a Crayette.) But customers are less interested in innovative architecture or performance benchmarks than in getting a specific job done, Mr. Paluck said. ''A company has typically already chosen its applications software, so you don't even get in the door without it,'' he said. Customers want to make certain that a given machine runs that software and ''how you do it -whether you use squirrels in a cage or vector processing - doesn't matter,'' he said. Difficult for Newcomers **********It will be very difficult for companies entering the market late to convince major software producers to write for their machines, Mr. Paluck said, which will in turn handicap their sales. He predicted these difficultties would be apparent by the end of the year. **********While no one denies the importance of software, other companies are betting that innovative architecture will give them an edge. The front-runner among these is the Alliant Computer Systems Corporation of Acton, Mass., which uses a technology called parallel processing. That system carves up standard programs and distributes the parts to as many as eight processors, allowing many calculations to be performed simultaneously. **********The technology allows the Alliant machine to perform certain types of tasks very rapidly. In addition, the machine's architecture permits customers to start small and build a system as their finances allow. ''We can offer a line of products starting at $250,000,'' Ronald H. Gruner, Alliant's president and co-founder, said. ''Later, customers can add processors to the same machine - it's a level of incremental growth not available from anyone else.'' **********Alliant's sales strategy has been to start small. By concentrating on niche markets it became profitable within three years of its December 1982 founding. ''A mistake many start-ups make is they don't realize there are segments of the market they can focus on very profitably right out of the gate,'' Mr. Gruner said. Credibility an Issue **********In the long term, however, a mini-super manufacturer must sell to mainstream corporate customers, who, in addition to performance and the ability to run existing applications software, require a high level of credibility from their suppliers. Accordingly, some of the companies are forming strategic alliances with large established computer manufacturers to help them get in the door. **********For example, Cydrome Inc., which expects to ship its first mini-super by midyear, recently signed a marketing agreement under which Prime Computer of Natick, Mass., will distribute and service the product. Prime, a maker of minicomputers, has invested in Cydrome, which was founded in May 1984 and is based in Milpitas, Calif. **********''Fortune 500 companies have, over the last five years, developed a short list of companies to deal with -I.B.M., Digital and others,'' said Andre O. Schwager, Cydrome's president. ''The only way in is through one of these distribution channels.'' **********Such alliances are important on a technical level because a mini-supercomputer ''has to fit into the ways customers are using computers today,'' Mr. Schwager said. ''Most big companies today are already in technology overload. They don't need bits and bytes - they need solutions.'' Giants Expected to Join In **********But joining hands with a major manufacturer is also a recognition of what many say is the inevitable entry of the giants into the market. The International Business Machines Corporation has introduced a vector-processing attachment for its 3090 series mainframe machines, and Digital is expected to add similar capability to the VAX within two years. **********In the meantime, Floating Point announced last month that it had entered an agreement under which Digital would market systems combining the VAX with Floating Point's attached-array processors. **********''There is a temptation for I.B.M. and Digital to increasingly offer vector capability in their machines,'' John Harte, Floating Point's vice president for sales and marketing, said. ''But we're specialists - we think we can stay sufficiently ahead and offer something more than DEC can themselves.'' **********While analysts attribute Floating Point's ills to its late entry with a stand-alone mini-super, Mr. Harte said the company had suffered from severe discounting by the newer companies and a slowdown in military spending. He expects both of those factors to ease in 1987. **********But still more competition is on the horizon at the low end of the market. Manufacturers of so-called super-work stations, such as Dana Computer Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., now promise performance approaching that of the mini-supers in a package hardly bigger than a PC. **********If they achieve the performance ''they're talking about,'' Mr. Harte said, ''they will be very competitive for all of us.''

By the end, Nigeria's civil war - initially an obscure tribal conflict - had moved to the stage of world public opinion. **********In one of the first televised wars, millions were moved by images of the Biafra babies, fragile skeletons with distended bellies, who succumbed by the thousands to a man-made famine. Experts now say the children who survived appear to have grown to healthy adulthood, and Nigeria's east bears few traces of the civil war that killed an estimated one million people. **********On a recent Saturday afternoon, the market in Owerri was filled with women carrying robust babies strapped to their backs. A far cry from the city's final, famine-racked days, Owerri's market stalls were loaded with three-foot-high pyramids of freshly baked bread. **********At Umuahia, at the National War Museum, tourists strolled through a photo exhibition on Biafra. Twenty years ago, the galleries served as the underground studios of the Voice of Biafra, which were used by the rebel leadership to exhort Ibo tribesmen to resist. **********Parked outside the museum are several Biafran ''Red Devils'' - armored cars improvised by the rebels from bulldozers and sheets of welded steel. Green tendrils of undergrowth curled through the treads, which long ago had frozen with rust. A Graveyard for Aviators **********In Uli, buses and brightly painted wagons sped over a section of Route A-6, where, at the height of the war, as many as 40 cargo planes landed each night, bringing arms and food to the encircled Biafrans. **********Aside from fragments of a Super Constellation aircraft rusting in a cornfield, the only hint of the road's earlier role was a rural establishment named ''Airport Hotel.'' **********Near the hotel, the sound of voices singing hymns floated through the open windows of St. Teresa's Church. But shoulder-high brush covered the church's once neatly tended graveyards, which hold the remains of two dozen Biafran and foreign aviators killed during the airlift. Biafra Became a Taboo Word **********Shortly after the war ended in January 1970, the graveyard was bulldozed by the Nigerian military seeking to erase physical reminders of the rebellion. Today, the region is intensely farmed. But local peasants cultivate only up to the invisible borders of the old burying grounds. **********In the post-war era, Biafra became a taboo word. The Bight of Biafra, a stretch of Nigeria's Atlantic coast, was renamed the Bight of Bonny. Biafra Light, the oil pumped from this area, is now called Bonny Light. **********In 1967, the Ibos broke away from Nigeria largely because they feared massacres at the hands of their ethnic rivals - the Hausa in the North and Yoruba in the South. Though all three groups are Nigerian, they are about as similar to one another as the French are to the Germans or the Italians. 'No Victor and No Vanquished' **********In 1966, anti-Ibo rioting, largely by Hausas, killed about 30,000 Ibos and created about a million Ibo refugees. During the ensuing civil war, it was fear of renewed killing that kept many Ibos fighting. **********But after Biafra's collapse, the massacres did not take place. Yakubu Gowon, then Nigeria's President, declared a policy of ''no victor and no vanquished.'' **********Oil also served as an ointment for national wounds. In the 1970's, Nigeria rode an oil boom and national income increased fivefold. A Reception of Embraces **********''I must say Nigeria has done a good job,'' said Benjamin Odogwu, an Ibo who served as Biafra's Director of Military Intelligence. ''The war was fought in all viciousness. We were surprised by the reception, the embraces.'' **********In 1982, after 13 years in exile in the Ivory Coast, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Biafra's bearded leader, returned to Nigeria. He was welcomed at the airport here by an enthusiastic crowd of a quarter million people. **********After an unsuccessful fling in politics, Mr. Ojukwu, 54 years old, has settled into the quiet life of a successful Lagos businessman. A Legacy of Discrimination **********''Ojukwu laughs last,'' read a recent report chronicling a current, more prosaic, preoccupation of the one-time rebel. On July 6, a Lagos court returned to Mr. Ojukwu the family mansion that the state had seized in the war. **********While Mr. Ojukwu, the Oxford-educated son of a millionaire, has landed on his feet in Lagos, many Ibos complain that they labor under a legacy of discrimination stemming from the civil war. **********In this nation ruled by the military, it was only this year that an Ibo reached the rank of a general. Although Ibos account for about a quarter of Nigeria's 100 million people, there is only one Ibo on Nigeria's supreme political organ, the 19-man Armed Forces Ruling Council. Currency Became Valueless **********During the war, many Ibos lost their fortunes when the Federal Government switched the currency in circulation, declaring the old coins and bills valueless. When peace came, Ibos were allowed to exchange a maximum of 20 Biafran pounds for 20 Nigerian pounds. **********Two years later, the Government embarked on a campaign that forced many foreign companies here to take on majority Nigerian ownership. Since the Ibos were destitute, control of the companies largely went to Hausa and Yorubas. **********''The east is not faring well after 20 years,'' said Arthur A. Nwankwo, a book publisher from Enugu, ticking off on his fingers a list of development projects that have gone to other regions of Nigeria. A Historical Curiosity **********Mr. Nwankwo maintains a ''Biafran section'' in his publishing house, which he said is putting into print an increasing number of civil war novels and memoirs. **********About half of all Nigerians were born since the war broke out. For many, Biafra is nearly a historical curiosity. **********''Some people have forgotten their losses, some people haven't,'' said Mokwugo Okoye, who was once a member of Biafra's Consultative Assembly. ''There are now more pressing issues - like the economy - not what happened 20 years ago.'' **********One enduring mystery of the period is the impact that the severe malnutrition had on a generation of Biafran children. Cities Double in Size **********In ''The Brutality of Nations,'' a book on Biafra published in New York this year, Dan Jacobs, the author, estimates that at the war's end, 31 percent of Biafran children under the age of 5 - or 480,000 children - suffered from severe malnutrition. **********''The people I have seen from that particular period are in secondary school and university and have not suffered any permanent injury,'' said H. I. Uzoewulu, medical director of St. Martin's Hospital here. Disabled War Veterans **********But reminders of the war occasionally intrude through eastern Nigeria's surface normality. **********On the westbound shoulder of Route A-232, a modern four-lane expressway that links Enugu and Onitsha, a group of eight men in wheelchairs gather every day in the shade of a palm frond. **********Passing the day chatting or telling war stories, these disabled Biafran war veterans wait for passing drivers to slow their cars and to throw coins or bills out their windows. **********''The Government regards us as outcasts,'' said Chuks Usim, a former Biafran corporal, as traffic sped by. Mr. Usim said his group is trying to raise money for new wheelchair tires. **********On a recent Sunday afternoon, cars filled with families stopped frequently. But some days go by, Mr. Usim said, when no one stops."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/20/business/company-news-digital-to-offer-mainframes.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1987-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 628, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIGITAL TO OFFER MAINFRAMES", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; DIGITAL TO OFFER MAINFRAMES", "body_text": " **********Moving into the mainframe computer arena, the Digital Equipment Corporation will announce today a $2.5 million system that links four of its most powerful VAX computers into one, giving it the speed of some of I.B.M.'s largest systems. **********Digital executives said the new system would give them, at last, the capability to compete with the largest products of the International Business Machines Corporation. Even companies that use VAX minicomputers often turn to I.B.M. or other mainframe manufacturers for their largest machines. **********Analysts were mixed in their reaction to the move, saying it would help Digital at a time when the company was already making major inroads against its much larger competitor, but would not have an immediate impact on I.B.M. The primary beneficiary, they said, would be users of Digital computers that sought bigger machines capable of using existing VAX software - perhaps Digital's biggest selling point. **********''This is an alternative style of computing when compared to I.B.M.,'' said Rose Ann Giodano, vice president of information system marketing for Digital. ''It is an integrated whole, all the way from a desktop, $5,000 computer to a mainframe.'' Two Options Offered **********The announcement today, at a news conference in New York, is expected to involve two new machines, the VAX 8974 and 8978. Both link VAX 8700 computers, the 8974 in a cluster of four processors, the 8978 in a cluster of eight. **********Digital said the 8974 would be able to process about 27 million instructions a second, putting it in direct competition with the low end of I.B.M.'s System 3090 computers. The 8978 would run at about twice that rate. **********The announcement of the clustered computers marks a continuation of Digital's VAX strategy, which in recent times has propelled the company to the top of the industry even in the midst of a computer slump. Extending the nine-year-old VAX design downward, Digital has introduced several small computers, including the Microvax II, a desktop machine that runs software designed for much larger Digital computers. Questions on Power **********At the same time, some experts question whether the multiprocessing solution that Digital and other manufacturers have settled on will actually provide heavy-duty users with the power they need. **********Four VAX's that are tied together do not process data more quickly than a single VAX - indeed, to solve most tasks only one of the four processors is at work. But because the four processors can work simultaneously, sharing mass storage devices and other expensive peripherals, they can reduce the waiting time that any individual user or program spends waiting for a single processor to become free. **********The clustered VAX computers accelerate an industry trend toward the combination of several processors in a single computer. But strictly speaking, the new VAX's are not ''parallel processors'' because their ability to divide a single problem and parcel it out to different processors is severely limited. **********''That's a software problem that still requires some additional work,'' said F. Grant Saviers, Digital's vice president of storage systems. ''Obviously, it's something we are working on intensely.'' **********Digital's announcement comes less than a week after the company announced a 98 percent jump in net income for its second fiscal quarter.

According to the Pentagon, the United States and Egypt are still involved in technical discussions about how the tank is to be equipped, the feasibility of Egypt's ability to co-produce it and the security safeguards to be applied to protect sensitive United States technology. **********The tank that would be produced would be the M1-A1, the most modern version of the M-1 main battle tank that is being bought by the United States Army. The tank carries a 120-millimeter gun, which the Army says is effective against ''advanced armor threats.'' Improving Egypt's Armor **********The sale would make Egypt the first foreign country to join in the production of the M-1. Plans to sell the tank have raised concerns because it would improve Egypt's armor force and because of fears over the possible loss of advanced technology. In addition, some critics say Egypt cannot afford to produce the tank and is seeking to do so out of national pride. **********American and Egyptian officials have been discussing the M-1 sale for years. Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger has supported such a sale and concluded in May 1986 that it should be approved, a Pentagon official said. **********The Administration has already taken steps toward an eventual sale. The manufacturer of the tank, the General Dynamics Corporation, was authorized last year to talk to the Egyptians about how M-1's could be produced at a factory being built in Egypt. The factory is to refurbish old American M-48 and M-60 tanks and could be adapted to produce M-1's. **********Pentagon and State Department officials said a key step was taken in February when an interdepartmental panel, the National Disclosure Policy Committee, certified that M-1 tanks could be produced in Egypt without risking the loss of sensitive technology. Pentagon Financing **********Under the committee's approach, many of the critical components of the tank, such as the armor and fire-control system, would be made in the United States and assembled in Egypt. But some details have yet to be worked out. Another step was taken when the Pentagon included in its fiscal 1988 budget $168 million in security assistance to Egypt to start the program to assemble the M-1, Pentagon officials said. **********Some members of Congress have been concerned because the Administration has not consulted Congress over the sale. Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said Congress has not been notified ''because our discussions with Egypt are in a preliminary stage and there's not sufficient detail to do so.'' **********The statements on the M-1 sale were prompted by a report from Cairo in The Washington Post. A Gradual Approach **********Egyptian officials have stressed the importance of the sale. The Egyptian Defense Minister, Mohamed Abdel Halim Abu Ghazala, said in October that Egypt would build new M-1 tanks to replace its old Soviet-made tanks and old American tanks. **********Some American officials said today that the Egyptian statements have overstated what the two sides had agreed upon, and that Egyptian officials have tended to exaggerate Egypt's proposed role in making the tank. **********American officials have talked about a gradual approach in which Egypt would first put emphasis on refurbishing older American tanks and start buying M-1's later. One Government official said that it is not likely that M-1 tanks would be produced in Egypt until well into the 1990's. **********Under the proposed terms of the sale, Egypt would be allowed to sell the M-1 tanks to other countries.

In addition, their stock prices have made them as attractive as investments as the money-center banks. **********Banking experts are currently divided over the impact of the interstate banking mergers on the industry. Some experts say the spawning of the super-regional banks marks the beginning of a shift in banking power, away from the money centers and to the regions.

Major Miranda is believed to be in the United States. **********A State Department official said the Nicaraguan Government's vilification of Major Miranda, who defected last week, showed the Sandinistas' anxiety about the damage he could cause.

ORTEGA DISCUSSES DEFECTOR **********MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 3 (AP) - Defense Minister Ortega described Major Miranda today as a ''little worm'' who took with him several documents of questionable strategic value, and said he expected the Reagan Administration to ''try to make a big show'' out of the defection. Mr. Ortega described Major Miranda as a staunch Sandinista military leader during the war that ousted Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979, but said that the officer had become ''resentful'' at being passed over in July for promotion to lieutenant colonel. **********The Defense Ministry had reported Friday that the major took $15,000 in Government money when he left Nicaragua. **********Mr. Ortega acknowledged that Major Miranda's position would have given him access to ''important information,'' including Mr. Ortega's own conversation with the high command about ''strategy, doctrine, even wherethe war in Central America would go in case of a U.S. intervention.'' **********Mr. Ortega also said the major could have taken with him information on Nicaragua's negotiations to obtain MIG fighter planes from the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Ortega disputed published reports in the United States that Major Miranda had been spying for the United States for a long time before his defection. Instead, he said the officer was ''reached by and fell in love with the C.I.A.'' when he accompanied Nicaragua's first lady, Rosario Murillo, to California on Sept. 5 to visit a demonstrator injured while protesting United States aid to the contras. **********''We feel burned by this treason, but we are not aggrieved, we are not sad,'' Mr. Ortega said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/22/world/soviet-afghanistan-veterans-call-for-end-of-neglect-and-for-honor.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1987-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1061, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Afghanistan Veterans Call For End of Neglect and for Honor", "print_headline": "Soviet Afghanistan Veterans Call For End of Neglect and for Honor", "body_text": " **********Soviet veterans of the war in Afghanistan have started a nationwide organization to combat official neglect of those who served in the war and to press for monuments honoring soldiers killed there, organizers of the group said today. **********The formation of the group, which was organized with official support, represents the most significant response so far to the mounting discontent of Afghanistan veterans, a group whose concerns have only recently begun to emerge. **********At a press conference organized today by the youth department of the official press syndicate, Novosti, leaders of the group said they had already won official approval for construction of the first national memorial honoring soldiers killed in the fighting. By Public Contribution **********The national memorial is to be paid for by public contributions and money earned by volunteer work, the veterans said today, and is likely to be erected in Moscow after a design competition. **********Nominally the monument will honor Soviet combatants slain in all ''internationalist'' campaigns, from the Spanish Civil War of the 1930's to the 1968 Soviet incursion in Czechoslovakia. But the project is clearly aimed at the veterans of Afghanistan. **********The group's leaders also said that 2,000 service veterans who concluded a conference this week in Ashkhabad approved a list of demands including an end to discrimination against disabled veterans in housing and employment and better pensions for the families of those killed in the war. On Prime-Time Television **********The 10-day meeting in Ashkhabad, the capital of Turkmenia, a Soviet republic bordering Afghanistan, was conducted under the auspices of Komsomol, the youth arm of the Communist Party, in an effort to provide official support - and direction - for informal veterans groups that have sprung up around the country. **********The work of the group was reported tonight on the prime-time television news program, and the full list of the veterans'' demands is to be published in the official press. **********Western diplomats estimate that at least half a million Soviet soldiers have served in Afghanistan, and that at least 12,000 have died there. No estimate of casualties has ever been published in the Soviet press. **********''Some soldiers would also like to know that number,'' said Vladimir Klimov, a veterans' leader who served in Afghanistan in 1980 and 1981. ''But at this point it is not available to us.'' Letters on 8-Year War **********Over the last year, the Soviet press has begun printing letters and articles probing into the sensitive subject of the eight-year war and its effect on society. **********Articles have complained about dodges employed by high-ranking officials to keep their children from serving in Afghanistan, lamented the brutalizing effect of the war on young servicemen, hinted at the hashish habit some soldiers brought back from the war and decried the public indifference or even resentment shown veterans when they come home and apply for jobs or apartments. **********Somewhat like American soldiers who returned from Vietnam, veterans of Afghanistan often find that citizens prefer not to hear about the war or view it with distaste. There is no organized opposition to the Soviet military role, but a recent poll conducted in Moscow by French and Soviet pollsters found that a majority of those questioned supported a total withdrawal. **********The Soviet Government has said it will remove its troops, possibly within a year, if the United States and Pakistan cease military aid to guerillas fighting the Soviet-backed Government, and if an acceptable transition government can be devised. **********The bitterness some Soviet citizens feel toward the war was evident in questions submitted anonymously to journalists last week in a public forum sponsored by the magazine Ogonyok. **********''The main question about Afghanistan is not the truth about the horrors and the deaths, but why are we there?'' one spectator wrote. Another urged the journalists to ''call a dirty war a dirty war.'' ''Remember Vietnam!'' scribbled a third. Soviet Decision Defended **********The veterans who spoke today defended the Soviet decision to enter Afghanistan in 1979, although one, Yuri Severinchik, who returned in 1982 and now heads a veterans' group in Moldavia, acknowledged that the war has damaged Soviet prestige. **********Veterans of the eight-year-old war, who are often called ''Afghantsi,'' have already organized in different cities, sometimes with local Komsomol support but often on their own. **********Visitors to Leningrad in August were startled to see a crowd of 200 veterans in blue berets like those worn by Soviet paratroopers marching through the city in a demonstration intended to draw attention to the sacrifices of Afghanistan veterans. **********Veterans who spoke today said the vast majority of the groups were devoted to more constructive activities like providing solace and financial support to families of slain servicemen, who often receive minimal pensions, and offering sports training for youngsters approaching draft age. **********The organization of the nationwide veterans' group is an effort by Komsomol to steer the veterans in what authorities consider a positive direction, and to make amends for Komosomol's admitted failure to fully address the problems of returning soldiers. **********The new group, affiliated with the Central Committee of Komsomol, is to press for better veterans' benefits, public respect for those who served, and physical training and indoctrination of teen-agers destined for military service. Waiting List for Apartments **********Mr. Severinchik said veterans who enter college after their service later find themselves far down on the waiting lists for apartments, whose short supply is a major grievance among young people. He said local officials are often insensitive to disabled veterans who want work, and the pensions are inadequate for both invalids and families of the war dead. **********Afghanistan veterans also complain that they do not receive all of the privileges accorded soldiers who served in World War II. Like veterans of earlier conflicts, Afghanistan veterans are entitled to a better choice of vacation times from their employers, easier entry into universities, and priority in getting telephones. But they are not guaranteed access to the special, better-supplied stores that serve older veterans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/13/world/kirkpatrick-is-cheered-in-managua.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1987-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 739, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kirkpatrick Is Cheered in Managua", "print_headline": "Kirkpatrick Is Cheered in Managua", "body_text": " **********Clouds broke and the sun shone on Jeane J. Kirkpatrick here Sunday as she drove a wildly cheering crowd of Nicaraguans to the brink of delirium. **********Cries of ''Viva Kirkpatrick!'' filled the air when the former chief American delegate to the United Nations stepped from a white Cadillac. As she approached the speaker's podium, the crowd rose and began clapping rhythmically. **********No one could recall the last time an American visitor to Nicaragua had received such a fervent reception. It began at Augusto Cesar Sandino Airport on Saturday, where Dr. Kirkpatrick was greeted by admirers who behaved as if they were welcoming a film idol. **********If the visit seemed incongruous to some, it was because Dr. Kirkpatrick advocates the violent overthrow of Nicaragua's Sandinista Government. She has campaigned for continued United States funding for the contras, and contra leaders consider her one of their most valuable allies. She is the only living American to have a rebel military unit named after her. 'Ultra-Rightist Policy' **********Photos of her arrival were featured in all three Managua daily newspapers. The pro-Government paper Nuevo Diario described her as ''one of the leading defenders of President Ronald Reagan's ultra-rightist policy towards Nicaragua.'' **********A formal public speech by such a prominent contra supporter was unparalleled in Nicaragua. Other contra supporters, such as Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, have visited but have not spoken publicly. **********The American Embassy distributed invitations to opposition political parties and other anti-Sandinista groups. Virtually every prominent opposition leader was in the crowd, which numbered over 1,000. **********''We love Kirkpatrick because she is strongly against the Sandinistas,'' said Jose Cruz Garcia, a member of the Conservative Party.''We want what she wants for Nicaragua.'' Government's Response **********The Government's response to her speech was, predictably, far different. Reuters reported that the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister, the Rev. Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, lashed out at Dr. Kirkpatrick today, saying: ''She was sent here by the man who invented the war against Nicaragua - Ronald Reagan. She is an envoy of death.'' **********The Government maintains that only a few misguided or resentful Nicaraguans sympathize with the contras, and that all patriots oppose them. Several people who came to see Dr. Kirkpatrick Sunday said after being promised anonymity that they hope for a contra victory. **********In Managua, Dr. Kirkpatrick visited editors of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, which reopened two weeks ago after having been shut since June 1986. She also met with leading opposition figures, including Carlos Huembes, president of the principal anti-Sandinista coalition; Lino Hernandez, a human rights lawyer, and Mario Rapaccioli, head of a militantly anti-Sandinista faction of the Conservative Party. She did not meet with any Sandinista officials. **********The adulation that anti-Sandinista leaders heaped on Dr. Kirkpatrick matched their scorn for the other prominent American who visited Managua this weekend, Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. Some in the opposition consider him excessively tolerant of the Sandinistas. There was a wave of boos when Mr. Huembes mentioned the Senator in his opening remarks. **********Reading her speech in Spanish, Dr. Kirkpatrick appeared forceful. She was repeatedly interrupted by applause, and excited guests waved small American flags during the speech. 'Right to Live Normal Lives' **********She referred to the Government as a dictatorship and said the contras were fighting ''for the right to live normal lives free of oppression and reprisals.'' ''Only Nicaraguans are deprived of their freedom, of control over their lives and of their basic rights,'' she said to rising cheers. ''Only Nicaraguans are exposed to arbitrary detention and imprisonment.'' **********Some in the highly partisan audience could barely control their glee. There were shouts of ''That's it!'' And ''Give it to them!'' **********At one point, a handful of dissident guests raised a protest banner supporting the new Central American peace accord. Jeering began quickly, but Dr. Kirkpatrick appealed for calm, and the protesters stood quietly holding their banner until she finished. **********Dr. Kirkpatrick said she too supports the peace accord, which would require an end to the contra war and the restoration of full political and press freedom in Nicaragua. But she said that she doubted the Sandinistas would comply."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/10/world/iran-contra-hearings-head-high-shoulders-straight-north-chain-command-when-be.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 4144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NORTH AND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND: WHEN TO BE A SCAPEGOAT AND WHEN NOT", "print_headline": "IRAN-CONTRA HEARINGS: 'HEAD HIGH AND SHOULDERS STRAIGHT'; NORTH AND THE CHAIN OF COMMAND: WHEN TO BE A SCAPEGOAT AND WHEN NOT", "body_text": " **********In the third day of the Iran-contra hearings yesterday, Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North was questioned about the day - last Nov. 25 - when he learned from a news conference that he had been dismissed. Here are excerpts from the testimony, as recorded by The New York Times.  SUBJECT OF INQUIRY **********ARTHUR L. LIMAN, chief counsel to the Senate committee. You learned at that press conference that you were the subject of a criminal investigation that was being initiated for an action, the diversion, which had been approved by your superior, Admiral Poindexter, and had been described in some five memoranda that you sent to Admiral Poindexter for approval by the President. Is that fair to say? **********COLONEL NORTH. Well I don't want to characterize anyone's reasons for doing **********Q. I didn't ask you, but you learned that you were the subject of a criminal investigation in that press conference? **********A. That is correct. **********Q. And you learned that it was a criminal investigation relating to the diversion - or what we call the diversion - the use of the profits of the Iranian arms sale to support the contras - you learned that, correct? **********A. That is correct. **********Q. And that was action that you took that you authorized, correct? **********A. It is action that I took that I believed I had full authority to take -that is correct? **********Q. Well, it had actually been authorized by Admiral Poindexter, is that not so? **********Q. He had communicated his approval to you - correct? **********A. Yes, he had. **********Q. You seem to be hesitating. I there any doubt in your mind. **********BRENDAN V. SULLIVAN Jr., Colonel North's counsel. You're just looking for tricks, Mr. Liman. **********Q. Well I can assure you I have none in my bag. **********SULLIVAN. He's testified fully about these matters. Mr. Chairman - excuse me, Mr. Chairman, he's testified fully about these matters. I thought we'd be onto some new important subject by now. **********CHAIRMAN. Please proceed. **********Q. Was it approved by him? **********A. The actions that I took, all of them, to include the use of residual funds from the sale of arms to Iran to support the Nicaraguan resistance and other activities were approved, all of them. **********Q. And, is it also so that for some months you had been telling friends like Mr. Owen that you were going to be the fall guy? **********A. I may well have, as I believe I have already testified. I may well have told Mr. Owen, and perhaps others, that if this whole thing came down to creating a political controversy or embarrassment, and remember again that Mr. Owen did not know, I don't believe, anything about the Iranian initiative, that I would be the person who would be dismissed or reassigned or fired or blamed or fingered or whatever one wants to use as a description - that I was willing to serve in that capacity. All of that assumed that this was not going to be a matter of criminal behavior, but rather one of deniability for the White House, the Administration, or whatever for political purposes. And when I say political purposes, I'm speaking of not only domestic, but the international ramifications. That is one of the essences of plausible deniability in a covert operation. **********Q. Are you saying, Colonel, that you were prepared to take the rap for political purposes, but not for criminal purposes? Is that what I just heard? **********A. Precisely. **********Q. Precisely. And is it a fact that on Nov. 21, after meeting with Admiral Poindexter, you told your colleague, Colonel Earl, that you were going to be the scapegoat? **********A. I don't recall that specific conversation and, on the first, I don't believe, with Colonel Earl. **********Q. Twenty-first. That's Friday. **********A. I may have. I don't deny that I said that to him. **********Q. Did you use the term scapegoat? **********A. I don't recall, counsel. I may have. **********Q. Well, scapegoat means someone who's going to take the blame for others. For whom did you expect to take the blame? **********SULLIVAN. Objection. He said he didn't recall whether he used scapegoat. **********Q. Well, yesterday you said that when the time came you were going to be dropped like a hot rock. That you were going to be the deniable link. I think you also used terms like scapegoat. For whom were you going to be the scapegoat? **********A. For whoever necessary, for the Administration - for the President, for however high up the chain that they needed someone to say that's the guy that did it. And he's gone, and now we've put that behind us and let's get on with other things. **********Q. And did you tell Admiral Poindexter that you were prepared to play that role? **********A. I had told Admiral Poindexter that, and I had told Mr. McFarlane that, as early as 1984. **********Q. Had you told Mr. Casey that? **********A. I think it may well have been his idea to begin with that there had to be somebody who was going to stand up and take the rap for this. **********Q. And this means what sir? **********A. Well, starting in 1984, for the political or international consequences of what we began to call the support for the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance. **********Q. And after that became involved, linked, with the Iranian arms sale and the proceeds, you were the person who was going to take the rap for that, too? **********A. I saw no difference from one to the other. **********Q. And you were prepared to do that? **********A. I have testified to that. **********Q. Now, Admiral Poindexter, who was your superior, and who had approved this, was not dismissed. Am I correct? **********A. Counsel, I don't recall the exact words that were used in that press conference. **********Q. Do you remember that he was treated differently, Colonel? **********A. Admirals should be treated differently than lieutenant colonels. **********Q. Well do you remember that he was allowed to resign and be transferred with honor? **********A. I don't recall those words specifically, but if that's what was said in the press conference, I assume that's what it was. **********Q. Do you recall at the press conference, the Attorney General indicated that Admiral Poindexter's problem was that he had gotten some indication of the diversion and had looked the other way - words to that effect? **********A. I do not. **********Q. Do you remember, sir, that as you listened to the press conference, that the Attorney General said nothing about the fact that Admiral Poindexter had approved the diversion? **********A. Quite frankly, counsel, I don't remember a great deal about that press conference, and if you want to show me the transcript, I'm sure it would refresh my memory. **********Q. Well, I can, but I'll move on, because I don't want to tarry on that. On the 21st, you did in fact discuss with Admiral Poindexter the problem of the diversion - is that so? I'll tell you - you're looking at a book there. What is the book, sir? **********A. The book is made up of notes that I have made in trying to prepare with counsel for this hearing -- **********Q. And -- **********A. It includes -- **********SULLIVAN. Don't tell him what it includes. **********Q. Well, I think that if a witness is looking at something, that I as counsel am entitled to see what he's refreshing his recollection on. **********SULLIVAN. I think you're wrong. That's a product of lawyers working with clients. **********Q. And you think that a witness is entitled to read something and that we're not entitled to see what he's reading? **********SULLIVAN. He's entitled to use his notes and preserve the attorney-client privilege. Everything in that book is a product of the attorney-client and work-product privilege, Mr. Liman, and you know that. **********Q. Are you able to recall your conversation with Admiral Poindexter on the 21st about the diversion without looking at that book? **********SULLIVAN. That's none of your business, either. You just ask him the question. **********CHAIRMAN. Please address the chair. **********SULLIVAN. Mr. Chairman, let's get to the substance of these hearings, and stop trying to - get off his back. **********CHAIRMAN. We have a P.A. system here. You need not shout, sir. **********SULLIVAN. Just - Mr. -- **********CHAIRMAN. Please proceed. **********A. Counsel, I would **********SULLIVAN. Don't answer the question. Next question, Mr. Chairman -it won't be answered.  * * *  A CHANGE IN PLAN **********Q. Once the documents were destroyed, you were out there without any kind of assurance that anyone would stand behind you. Is that fair to say? **********A. That was the plan. It was planned that I would be out there. **********Q. And when the plan changed was when you had the I.C., or the criminal investigation announced. **********A. Well, I don't know where - in who else's mind the plan changed, counsel. I know that when I heard the words criminal investigation or criminal behavior or whatever the words were that were used in the press conference - or shortly thereafter, I don't - it was certainly profound at that point - that my mind-set changed considerably. **********Q. Now you had -- **********A. And I think - if you'll indulge me for a second - over the five and a half years that I had served on the N.S.C. staff, I had - as I hope I have testified here today - sought every possible means to do what needed to be done, within the law. We had gone in extremis to find a way to live within the constraints and proscriptions of Boland. And I had sought a means in 1985, in working with various lawyers, various counsel, to find a way to implement a policy that started without my acquiescence or support or direction or anything else, and work very, very hard to find legal ways to carry out the policy of the President. **********And there was probably not another person on the planet Earth as shocked as I was to hear that someone thought it was criminal. And I can tell you that that shock was compounded when I heard later that there was to be an independent counsel; and further compounded when I was the only name in the appointment order for that independent counsel. The only person on the planet Earth named in that appointment order, counsel.  * * * **********Q. Now you've already testified that Casey had approved this . . . **********A. Which is this? **********Q. The diversion. **********A. I had consulted very carefully on Director - with Director Casey and he - I don't know if approved is the right word. Director Casey was very enthusiastic about the whole program, and advocated it. **********Q. Now when you met with the Attorney General on the afternoon of the 23d of November, he asked you about the diversion, correct? **********A. He did, he asked me specifically about that memorandum. **********Q. And is it true that he asked you who knew about the fact that proceeds from the sale of Iranian arms were being used to support the contras? **********A. I think he may well have. I, again, I'm not entirely clear on that afternoon. I was up until very early in the afternoon before it. I'd had a meeting with Mr. McFarlane on it. And I suppose he may well have. Again, I do not have detailed specific recall of that. . . . **********Q. Do you recall that you told him that Admiral Poindexter knew, that Richard Secord knew and that Mr. McFarlane knew? **********A. That sounds right. **********Q. Do you recall that you did not tell the Attorney General of the United States that Director Casey knew? **********A. I don't recall that I didn't. **********Q. Well, was it part of the plan at that stage that you would not name Director Casey? **********A. It had always been part of the plan that Director Casey would know nothing of the support to the Nicaraguan resistance. **********Q. And who else was it part of the plan who would not know anything about the support to the Nicaraguan resistance? **********A. Other Cabinet officers who had to testify and appear and things like that. . . .  * * * **********Q. Colonel, you testified a moment ago, unless you misunderstood the question -- **********SULLIVAN. Counsel, I think you were missing each other there. **********Q. Well, we'll soon see. That it was always part of the plan that Director Casey would not be - would not know. Is that in essence what you said? **********A. If you mean by the plan, the fall-guy plan, yes. **********Q. And so the fall-guy plan was that even though Casey knew, you would not finger him - to use a colloquial expression. **********A. Your expression, counsel, not mine. **********Q. But you wouldn't name him. **********A. That's correct. **********Q. And then the next question I asked was were there other people who knew things that you were also not supposed to name? **********A. Not that I know of. In other words, I know of no other people who actually knew. And I have testified as to who I knew knew - I'm confusing myself. I have testified as to who I believe knew about the plan; I have testified as to who I can actually confirm knowledge, by virtue of the memoranda that I created, the conversations we had and the record that you see before you from the PROF system. But I had specifically talked to the Admiral, and I could well have said to the Attorney General - on the 23d, I guess it was, that Sunday -that, oh, by the way, the President knows. **********But I had asked the Admiral on Friday if the President knew and the Admiral had told me no. And so when the Attorney General asked me about the President, I told him no.  * * *  ON QUESTIONING ORDERS **********NORTH. I had assumed from the day I took my post at the National Security Council that those things which required the approval of the President, and I sent forward memoranda soliciting that approval, and I got the authority to proceed on various initiatives, had indeed received the approval of the President. I've testified to that. **********LIMAN. And it wasn't until Admiral Poindexter answered your question that that assumption was shaken. **********A. It wasn't shaken, he simply denied that the President knew. **********Q. Did you ask him: Admiral Poindexter, why did you not discuss this with the President? **********A. No. **********Q. Why not? **********A. First of all, I'm not in the habit of questioning my superiors. If he deemed it not to be necessary to ask the President, I saluted smartly and charged up the hill. That's what Lieutenant Colonels are supposed to do. I have no problem with that. I don't believe that what we did, even under those circumstances, is wrong or illegal. I've told you I thought it was a good idea to begin with. I still think it was a good idea, counsel. **********Q. Have you wondered why, if it was a good idea, that the President of the United States dismissed you because of it? **********A. Let me just make one thing very clear, counsel. This lieutenant colonel is not going to challenge a decision of the Commander in Chief, for whom I still work. And I am proud to work for that Commander in Chief and if the Commander in Chief tells this lieutenant colonel to go stand in the corner and sit on his head, I will do so. And if the Commander in Chief decides to dismiss me from the N.S.C. staff, this lieutenant colonel will proudly salute and say, thank you for the opportunity to have served, and go. And I am not going to criticize his decision no matter how he relieves me, sir. **********Q. Has anyone given you an explanation, Colonel North, on behalf of the President of why he did not think it was a good idea and dismissed you? **********A. The President of the United States saw fit to call me later the same day and in the course of that call, which was also intensely personal, he told me words to the effect, I just didn't know. I have no reason to disbelieve what the Commander in Chief told me, sir. **********Q. Did you say to him, I received approval from Admiral Poindexter and Director Casey? **********A. I did not say those words to the Commander in Chief. I simply expressed my thanks for having been able to serve him for five and a half years, and my regrets that my service had brought forth a political firestorm and difficulties when all I sought to do was to help, and that what I may have done was to hurt him.  * * *  SHREDDING DOCUMENTS **********Q. Do you remember shredding documents during the lunch hour on the 22d, when the representatives of the Attorney General's office had left for their lunch? **********A. I remember shredding documents while they were in there reading documents. **********Q. You were shredding them in their presence? **********A. Well, I mean, they were sitting in my office and the shredder was right outside and I walked out and shredded documents. **********Q. More than a few pieces of paper, right? **********A. Pardon? **********Q. It would be more than a few pieces of paper. **********A. Well, that's a pretty high-speed shredder. It eats them pretty quick. And I'm not trying to be light about it, but I mean, they were sitting in my office reading and I'd finish a document and say, we don't need that anymore. I'd walk up and I'd go out and shred it. They could hear it. The shredder was right outside the door. **********Q. I'm not trying to be light about it either, but they, you would go up there and take documents that they had finished reading? **********A. No, no, no. I want to be very clear. My office, and you've now had a diagram of this palatial basement office on the third floor of the old E.O.B. It was up on the wall here somewhere. And the desk that I had was in the corner of my office. And then there was a table about this size and on that table was laid out all of the Iran documents. And I was working at my desk on other things, literally cleaning up files on lots of things. And when I'd finish with a handful of documents, I'd walk up, walk past them, walk out the door, you know where the shredder was, turn the corner, turn on the shredder and drop them in. **********Q. And did anyone say to you, colonel what are you doing? **********A. No. And I didn't think anything of it, either. You know, what you've got to understand, counsel, is that I didn't think I'd done anything wrong. **********Q. Well I understand that. **********A. And I don't think that they necessarily thought that I had done anything wrong. And so an officer who's got a shredder in his office, ought to be, if he's not on the telephone or reading or writing documents, and needs to get rid of them, puts them in the shredder. **********Q. The record is that before lunch hour, Mr. Reynolds found the diversion document. **********A. But he didn't tell me. **********Q. And I know he didn't tell you, colonel, so if you wait for the question, you're going to get your opportunity to answer. I'm not interrupting your answers. **********SULLIVAN. Yet. **********Q. Not at all. He found that document. He attached significance to that document. And what you're saying is that even after that, which occurred before lunch, you were there taking batches of documents pass these attorneys from the Department of Justice and shredding them and they weren't saying stop, we'd like to look? What are you doing? We're concerned. None of that, right? **********A. I'm not trying to leave the wrong impression, counsel. O.K. What I'm saying to you is I thought and perhaps they thought - and I'm trying to be in several people's mind at once - is that they were looking for the facts on what had transpired in September and October, November of 1985. All right? And what I was told they were looking for I thought was in the files that I gave them. Let me finish. **********I was also engaged in a number of other projects of national security importance, the fact that I was shredding documents, I don't think would be unusual to them. This was, afterall, an office with a shredder in it. **********I'm not trying to say that these guys were just letting me willy-nilly go and shred documents. I had a shredder for that purpose. If I'd finish reading a top secret cable of intelligence value, you don't leave those things sitting around your office. You destroy them after you read them. And that's what I was doing. **********Q. Were you taking single documents over to the shredder or were you taking files over to the shredder? **********A. I was not taking files. I would go through a file. I was sitting at my desk. They were working 10 feet from me and we would go, they were working on their projects, I was working on mine. **********Q. I want to hear more about, go ahead. I'm not interrupting. **********A. I don't think you ought to accuse them of incompetence because they stopped a guy from doing his job. That's why the Government of the United States gave me a shredder.  * * * **********Q. Colonel, was your work on the phone with the Israelis leading you to you shred documents? **********SULLIVAN. Objection. **********A. On occasion. **********Q. Weren't you going through your files to get rid of embarrassing documents? **********A. Embarrassing, no. Documents that would compromise the national security of the United States, documents that would put lives at risk, documents that would demonstrate a covert action under U.S. direction and control and relationship to it, yes. Embarrassing, no. I'm not embarrassed to be here, counsel. **********Q. Are you saying Colonel, that you thought that allowing the Attorney General of the United States or his representatives to see documents would jeopardize lives? **********A. No. What I'm saying to you, counsel, is that revelations regarding those documents would destroy lives. Many of the documents that I destroyed that day, prior to that day and after that day, had absolutely no relationship to the Iranian activities. They had to do with Nicaraguan resistance activities. They had to do with counterterrorist operations, things that were, just as this committee has, I think, a scope within which they operate, they were looking for specific Iranian associated activities. And thus if I had a file of matters pertaining to support for the internal opposition in Nicaragua, or people who I had contacted in Europe and with whom I had worked to get weapons for the Nicaraguan resistance. And sitting there at my desk I would pull those out and look at them and say, North if you're not here tomorrow, this doesn't need to be found by anybody, I would take them over to the shredder and destroy them. That's what I'm saying. It was beyond the pale of their inquiry. **********Q. Colonel, those were files that you had assembled over time. Correct? **********A. Five and one-half years, sir. **********Q. And those were files that had remained secure for five-and-a-half years. Is that correct? **********A. That is correct. **********Q. And you knew whoever your successor was, who would occupy that office would be someone who was selected by the National Security Adviser. Is that correct? **********A. I did not know that the person who moved into that office would share the same responsibilities, or indeed have anything to do with the matters in which I had worked. And the documents that existed in the permanent files were all that were necessary to carry on whatever - the activities in which I was engaged, and it was only a part of my work, counsel, in support of the Nicaraguan resistance and in support of the Iranian initiative were being terminated. There was no need to retain those documents. **********Q. Do you deny Colonel, that one of the reasons that you were shredding documents that Saturday was to avoid the political embarrassment of having these documents be seen by the Attorney General's staff? **********A. I do not deny that.  * * *  A SUBORDINATE'S DUTY **********Q. I hear you saying that if you weren't on the order for the appointment of an independent counsel, if there was agreement that there was no criminal liability here, people would expect you to come before Congress and say, 'I did it, it's not their fault. I was that loose cannon.' **********A. I am not, as I said in my statement, at all ashamed of any of things that I did. I was given a mission and I tried to carry it out. **********Q. But part of that mission was to shield the others who had given you the orders. **********A. That is the part of any subordinate.

The report was also critical of Sol Littman, representative in Canada for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, whom the commission identified as the primary source for article in The Times. **********The article appeared to have played a major role in the decision by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to appoint the commission in February 1985. The Government order establishing the inquiry under Justice Jules P. Deschenes of the Quebec Superior Court began with a reference to the concerns aroused in Canada by the report that Mr. Mengele ''may have entered or attempted to enter Canada.'' Documents Are Cited **********Two weeks earlier, the Times report, by Ralph Blumenthal, received wide publicity here. The article cited United States Army intelligence documents obtained by the Wiesenthal Center as indicating that Mr. Mengele may have been arrested and released in the American zone of Vienna in 1947 and may have sought a Canadian visa from Buenos Aires under a pseudonym in 1962. **********The Deschenes report said the commission had investigated the possibility thoroughly and found no evidence to support it. It said that there was no Canadian immigration ofice in Buenos Aires in 1962, and that the Department of Immigration in Ottawa, to which any application would have been passed, had no record of any application under Mr. Mengele's name or any of the pseudonyms he was known to have used. Interviewed in November **********The report said that counsel for the inquiry had interviewed Mr. Blumenthal in New York in November 1985. It quoted the Times reporter as saying that he had ''access to no other documents'' than those released in the United States. This appeared to be a reference to the Army materials obtained by the Wiesenthal Center that the report said had been inspected and found to ''make no reference whatsoever to a Buenos Aires approach by Mengele.'' **********The report said that Mr. Blumenthal, in the interview in New York, had also said that there were no ''other records'' to support his article, and had added that ''with the benefit of hindsight'' his report might appear ''a bit loose.'' The reporter was quoted as saying that the purported Mengele visa application was first brought to his attention by Mr. Littman. **********Mr. Blumenthal said the Canadian report ''mischaracterizes the tenor of the story, which fairly reflected the state of information available at the time.'' He continued: ''The article was based on declassified documents and on other information provided by the Wiesenthal Center. Subsequent disclosures of fact since the story appeared in January 1985, and the Canadian Government investigation now cast doubt on any connection with Canadian immigration authorities.'' **********The commission said it had been advised by lawyers for The Times 10 days after the Blumenthal interview that the reporter would not be permitted to appear as a witness before the commission, that he would not sign an account of his conversation with the commission's investigators and that ''there would be no further communication.'' **********''The commission regrets the refusal of The New York Times to cooperate with it,'' the report added. ''Subsequent events, however, have robbed that refusal of its potentially negative effects.'' **********This appeared to be a reference to the Canadian Government's finding that reports of the Mengele visa application were not true. **********Last year, an international team of forensic experts determined that a skeleton buried near Sao Paulo, Brazil, was the remains of Mr. Mengele, who was reported to have drowned in 1979."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/21/business/an-unlikely-lab-for-free-markets.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1987-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1199, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AN UNLIKELY LAB FOR FREE MARKETS", "print_headline": "AN UNLIKELY LAB FOR FREE MARKETS", "body_text": " **********ON a continent known for protectionism and government control over the economy, Chile's controversial effort to create a market economy is finally showing signs of success after a drastic collapse in 1982 and 1983. **********Despite the burdens of a repressive dictatorship that has made the country a pariah of the international community, rock-bottom prices for copper, its chief export, and a $20 billion foreign debt, Chile's economy should expand for the fourth consecutive year in 1987. Not surprisingly, the group of economists who have advised Chile's military Government since it overthrew President Salvador Allende in a bloody coup in 1973, is calling the turnaround a vindication of its free-market policies. **********The economists, known as the Chicago Boys because so many of them were graduated by the University of Chicago, viewed its task as confronting not only the heritage of the Socialists and Communists of the Allende Government but also the old conservative farming and industrial elite, which had been accustomed to subsidies and protected markets. **********Their policies, based on low tariffs on imports, drastic cuts in Government spending and bureaucracy and streamlining state-owned corporations with the idea of selling them to the public, have finally produced results. Still, some analysts question the merits of some of the free-market policies and wonder whether Chile's poor have actually shared in the economic revival. **********The Chicago Boys can tick off a number of healthy economic trends to support their case. Chile's inflation-adjusted gross national product grew 5.7 percent last year and Wharton Econometrics predicts it will grow by 4.7 percent this year. Unemployment fell to 8.8 percent last year, down from 12 percent in 1985, and 21 percent 1982. Currently, about 4 percent of the labor force is enrolled in public works programs down from 8 percent during the 1982-83 recession. **********But the country's single biggest success story is the expansion of exports. Once Chile's only significant export, copper now makes up less than half the value of all exports. Chile still produces and exports more copper than any other country but with copper prices depressed and other exports growing, copper is less important than in the past. **********Most of the growth has come in fresh fruit and other farm and fisheries products. Exports totaled $4.2 billion last year, up about 10 percent from 1985, providing a trade surplus of $1.3 billion. **********The Government predicts exports will grow to $7 billion in 1990, even though copper prices are not expected to improve significantly. Chile hopes to greatly expand exports of wood products from the south of the country, where trees grow more rapidly than most places in the world, with the possibility that wood products could rival copper in export importance by the end of the century. **********Even Chile's manufacturing industries, which traditionally turned out products exclusively for domestic consumption, are beginning to become exporters. Jorge Frauenberg, manager of the Tecno Industrial Company, a maker of home appliances, said that his company had recently found markets for its refrigerators in smaller countries in the Western Hemisphere and Asia. **********Because of the 1982-83 recession, which produced hundreds of bankruptcies and Government intervention in the banking system, the state still controls much more of the economy than it wants to control. But the trend is toward privatization or re-privatization. **********One of the things the Chicago Boys learned along the way is that it is difficult to privatize big state-created corporations when there is no major foreign investor waiting to buy. Employee stock purchases and the investments of the private social security plans have become important in a number of these efforts. **********Critics of Gen Augusto Pinochet Ugarte's regime find some things to praise in the re-ordered economy. Still they would like to introduce measures to cushion the country, and especially its poor, from the vagaries of global economics. **********Andres Zaldivar, a Christian Democrat who is viewed as a potential Presidential candidate in the uncertain future, said the figures show ''that the economy is successful, compared to the rest of Latin America.'' He added that he did not think there would be ''profound changes in the management of the economy regarding private enterprise or the market, no price controls and no resumption of bank nationalizations.'' **********''But there are hidden problems,'' said Mr. Zaldivar, ''that will come up as soon as a civilian government takes office. There will have to be a strong correction in social policy because any civilian government will face demands for better salaries, more jobs and housing.'' **********ALEJANDRO FOXLEY, a leading Christian Democratic economist, said he was ''not a believer in naive laissez-faire economics'' but that the Christian Democrats, if they took office, would have ''eclectic'' policies and maintain a market orientation. He said that a too rigid approach to economics caused Chile's G.N.P. to decline more steeply in relation to other Latin American nations when commodities prices dropped at the beginning of the decade. **********''Ask yourself what would have happened with Japanese imports into the United States if Congress had had to confront an unemployment rate of 30 percent,'' said Mr. Foxley. ''That is what happened here and no one was listening.'' **********Jose Pinera, Chile's labor minister from 1978 to 1981, argued that if the economic situation of the poor had worsened it could be attributed to the world commodities crisis, not to Chile's specific policies. There is some support for this view in a World Bank study of five Latin American countries, which concluded that Costa Rica and Chile had made the most effort to cushion the poor from the collapse of commodity prices. **********While rejecting challenges to their economic wisdom, the economic brain trust that has served the Pinochet regime acknowledges there was a large contradiction in trying to implant economic liberalism under a military dictatorship. **********Pablo Barahona, a Chicago graduate and former minister of economy, said the situation in 1973 had been ''so chaotic, so radical, so extreme that I would say easily 80 percent of the people found it completely legitimate for the armed forces to take power, and completely legitimate that the armed forces put down the centers of resistance.'' **********He said it was about 1977 before the economists began to realize they had philosophical differences with those who envisioned a ''fascist'' political structure. That became apparent, he said, when the economists began to suggest - and were rebuffed - that the Government should divest itself of its newspaper and television channel because Government ownership of the media was inconsistent with a market economy. **********Sebastian Pinera, a banker and brother of the former labor minister, said he feared the political question would come to obscure the real economic accomplishments. **********''The problem,'' he said, ''is that free-market economics has come to be associated in the minds of many people with dictatorship.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/23/business/canada-backs-lumber-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada Backs Lumber Pact", "print_headline": "Canada Backs Lumber Pact", "body_text": " **********A lumber agreement with the United States, in which Canada agreed to impose a 15 percent export tax on softwood exports, has been approved by the House of Commons. **********Legislation putting into effect the Dec. 30 accord passed by a vote of 92 to 33. **********Canada agreed to impose the tax, after heated negotiations, to avoid punitive duties after the United States Department of Commerce upheld charges from the United States lumber industry that Canadian lumber was unfairly subsidized. **********The United States industry complained about the legislative delay, although the export tax has been collected since Jan. 8. **********By creating an export tax, Canada receives $600 million (Canadian), or $450 million (United States), in revenue.

This ''problem solving'' approach is vastly preferable to an acrimonious, expensive resolution by litigation, which should be the last alternative. **********Secondly, mediation by a neutral professional, skilled in both the technical aspects of divorce as well as the emotional dynamics of divorcing and negotiating, can be of great assistance to the divorcing parties. They then shape and fine tune the terms of their own divorce, which would be legally resolved without contest. Regrettably, there are few mediators who have the grounding in both the law and psychology necessary to perform this delicate role in a way that produces all relevant information and fully satisfies the ''reasonable expectations'' of each party. **********The most effective model for divorce mediation is for each of the parties to have separate legal counsel who coaches them through the mediation process, but who is not present during the mediation meetings. **********In my experience, only about 15 percent of divorcing couples are suitable for the intense emotional interplay inherent in divorce mediation. **********PAUL D.

Sanchez, will leave office on Jan. 31 amid reports from Administration and Congressional sources that investigators are questioning the nature of his role in the Iran-contra affair. **********Robert Sims, the Defense Department spokesman, said today that there was ''nothing unusual at all'' about the retirement, adding ''he told me he just wants to go home to live on his farm in Leesburg,'' Va. **********But some other Defense Department officials said Mr. Sanchez was being eased out because the investigations of the controversy were getting uncomfortably close to his activities. So far, the Pentagon has not been linked to the controversy in any major way. **********Mr. Sims and some other Pentagon officials said Mr. Sanchez, who will be 60 this year, was planning to retire anyway. Mr. Sims added that Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger is ''sorry to see him go'' and plans to ''commend his service.'' 'Just a Matter of When' **********In an interview this evening, Mr. Sanchez said he was not surprised at speculation that he was leaving office because of the investigations. But he added: ''I've been talking about retiring for some time, and it's just a matter of when. No time's a good time. But I have some personal matters that I must attend to.'' **********He added that although he would not be surprised if he is called as a witness in the Iran-contra inquiries, no one has called him yet. He said he had not been involved in anything improper. **********Mr. Sanchez was a Central Intelligence Agency officer for 30 years before becoming Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Inter-American Affairs in 1981. **********He was responsible for formulating Defense Department positions on Central American policy, and presented those positions as its representative at interagency meetings that included officials from the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council. Monitoring of Aid Effort **********Officials said Mr. Sanchez monitored official and unofficial military aid to the anti-Sandinista forces in Nicaragua known as contras, including private shipments that had significant Government involvement during the period that Congress prohibited direct military assistance. **********After a flight with arms for the contras was shot down over Nicaragua on Oct. 5, officials said Mr. Sanchez was instrumental in planting a false report that was widely reported by American news organizations, asserting that the aircraft was on a private mission and had no Government connection. **********Only one member of the plane's three-man crew, Eugene Hasenfus, survived. The Sandinista Government convicted Mr. Hasenfus of espionage but released him last month. **********Mr. Sanchez acknowledged that he and others in Government were aware of the covert arms shipments but added ''I didn't know the origin of them.'' Report of Cover Story **********As part of the cover story devised after the crash, officials said, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Elliott Abrams, intended to ask Gen. John K. Singlaub, a retired officer who was then in the Philippines, to take responsibility for the plane. General Singlaub, who was involved in various covert operations while in the Army, had more recently organized and helped to finance several legal, open shipments of nonlethal supplies to the contras. **********The reports about General Singlaub's purported involvement appeared in print, however, before Mr. Abrams could reach him, the officials said. Mr. Abrams has denied this account. **********After he returned to the United States, the general held a news conference in Washington and angrily denied any involvement with the flight. **********Numerous officials said Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force officer, had arranged with associates for the flight in which Mr. Hasenfus was shot down. General Secord is also under investigation. Relationship to Retired Officers **********Pentagon officials as well as acquaintances of Mr. Sanchez outside the Government said he had monitored the operations of both General Singlaub and General Secord, but they asserted that he had not directed them. **********In other activities, Mr. Sanchez appeared to have been caught in a dispute between his former associates at the C.I.A. and his present colleagues in the Defense Department over how to train the contras in guerrilla operations and what sort of strategy they should adopt. **********The C.I.A., according to Pentagon officials, wanted to train the contras in conventional infantry tactics and to persuade them to fight decisive engagements with Sandinista forces with the intention of seizing territory and forming a provisional government. **********In contrast, the officials said, military officers argued that the contras were so poorly led and equipped that they would have little chance against the more numerous, better trained Sandinistas. **********For the moment, the officials said, the C.I.A. has had the better of the argument, and the Defense Department has been relegated to a supporting role."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/10/business/argentina-faults-banks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Argentina Faults Banks", "print_headline": "Argentina Faults Banks", "body_text": " **********Argentina's Economy Minister, Juan Sourrouille, said today that the ''narrow interest'' of creditor banks was holding up an accord to stretch out debt repayments.

Roger Miranda Bengoechea, that Moscow intends to increase arms shipments to Nicaragua and base MIG-21 fighter aircraft there.

Gorbachev. Defector Meets Legislators **********A senior United States official said the Administration had generally confirmed Major Miranda's information well before Mr. Gorbachev arrived in the United States. The State Department arranged for Major Miranda to be interviewed by reporters on Thursday, Mr. Gorbachev's last day here. **********But Administration officials denied they had withheld Major Miranda's charges from the summit agenda so that they could be used more effectively afterward to persuade Congress to provide new aid for the contras. **********Major Miranda's assertions that despite a Central American peace plan, the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua is planning to build up its armed forces with Soviet help were being presented forcefully by the Administration as evidence of the need for Congress to provide new contra financing. Major Miranda was brought to Capitol Hill today to meet privately with several legislators of both parties. 'Strong Impact' Is Hope **********''We hope that these revelations will have a strong impact,'' Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman, said. ''Those who have favored aid to the democratic resistance in the past on the grounds that the Sandinistas are trying to subvert democratic government and are, with the help of the Soviet Union, building up a military force of unprecedented strength, will not be surprised by these revelations. Those who remain unconvinced must consider the testimony of a former high-ranking Sandinista official.'' **********Lieut. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the national security adviser, conferred with members of Congress today over the Administration's proposal for further aid to the contras. Some members of Congress, including several opponents of contra aid, conceded today that the Miranda disclosures would be of immeasurable help to the Administration in seeking to persuade Congress to approve new aid. **********A Senate version of a catchall spending bill contains about about $16 million in new aid for the contras through the end of February. There is no new contra aid in the House version of the bill and a conference committee to reconcile the difference was set up today. The negotiations between the House and Senate over the bill are expected to be highly contentious, with the contra aid issue at the top of the list of things to be resolved. **********Mr. Reagan has threatened to veto any measure that does not contain some non-arms aid to maintain the contras as a fighting force. **********The House Speaker, Jim Wright, who has been a central figure in the contra aid issue, seemed angered over the Miranda disclosures, which were largely confirmed over the weekend by Humberto Ortega Saavedra, the Nicaraguan Minister of Defense and the brother of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra. **********Referring to the charges that Nicaragua intends to put as many as 600,000 men under arms by 1990, Mr. Wright said that was a ''preposterous'' idea but that it would help efforts to renew contra aid. In the past, he has persuaded the Nicaraguan Government to temper its actions so as not to inflame Congress and today he complained, ''The Sandinistas have had a history of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.'' **********Senator Peter V. Domenici, a New Mexican Republican and a supporter of additional contra aid, said: ''I was very proud of the Sandinistas over the weekend. They made it very easy for us.'' **********Representative Vic Fazio, a California Democrat, said the Miranda disclosures would make the Administration's task easier. **********The House Republican leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, said the disclosures meant that Congress would have to consider whether President Ortega ever meant to comply with the Central American peace plan signed last August. **********President Ortega tried today to minimize the damage done by his brother's confirmation of some of Major Miranda's charges. Mr. Ortega told reporters that his brother was incorrect in saying such a buildup would occur because it was only a proposal. Major Miranda was a top aide to Humberto Ortega. **********General Powell said today that the United States would pursue ''rather quickly'' a suggestion by Mr. Gorbachev last week that the Soviet Union would drastically reduce its aid to Nicaragua if the United States ended its support for the contras. **********Over the weekend, General Powell said that Mr. Gorbachev made the remarks during a stroll with President Reagan and offered few details except to suggest that the level of Soviet aid could drop to simply providing police equipment. General Powell called the Gorbachev statement ''cryptic.'' **********Administration officials offered conflicting statements today as to how the information provided by Major Miranda was used by the President or other officials in talking to Mr. Gorbachev or his party last week. **********A State Department spokesman said Mr. Reagan did not raise the issue as the discussion between the two men on Nicaragua was extremely brief. Mr. Fitzwater first said that the matter was not raised because the agenda for the summit had already been set.

The words ''next year in Jerusalem,'' pronounced during the traditional seder, have both a hopeful and a hollow sound. **********Tonight, however, at a time of ferment and liberalization inside Soviet society, the yearning took on a new intensity and a grander scope as Secretary of State George P. Shultz attended the beginning of a seder at Spaso House, the American Ambassador's residence, for about 50 of the most prominent and longstanding would-be Jewish emigres and their families. **********Many who were at the seder had been in prison or Siberian exile for calling on Washington to put pressure on Soviet authorites to relax the emigration restrictions affecting all Soviet citizens. **********Mr. Shultz, an Episcopalian, wore a white yarmulke as he went to every table, shook every hand and exchanged a few words with practically everyone. He seemed in awe of these tough, cheerful, resolute men and women bearing names familiar to him from the lists he presents at every meeting with high Soviet officials. **********These were names that have been emblazoned on the signs carried by demonstrators in the West for more than a decade: Aleksandr Lerner, Vladimir Slepak, Viktor Brailovsky, Ida Nudel, Iosif Begun, Naum Meiman, Abe Stolar, Yevgeny Yakir, Arkady Mai and others. **********''There are a lot of famous people in this room,'' Richard Schifter, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, told Mr. Lerner, a computer scientist who has been seeking an exit visa since 1971. In that time, his daughter has emigrated to Israel and his wife has died. **********Mr. Shultz presented a handsomely bound copy of the Haggadah, the ritual readings and prayers that accompany the Passover meal, to Mr. Begun, a sinewy dissident who was just released from his third term in prison in February but has still not received permission to leave the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Shultz then gave Mr. Slepak a framed photograph of the Slepak grandchildren, who live in the United States. Mr. Slepak, with a gray beard and a ruddy face, has the look of a prophet; he has been waiting 17 years for an exit visa and has served several years in exile. The picture had come from Mr. Slepak's two sons, Alexander and Leonid, who emigrated years ago. **********''A picture is better than nothing,'' Mr. Shultz said sympathetically. ''We have four grandchildren. They've just been at our house for a couple of weeks. We're very grandchildren-oriented.'' Mr. Slepak replied, ''I'm so moved by your attention.'' **********Indeed, they were all moved. ''I think he made an extremely important gesture,'' said Mr. Brailovsky, a mathematician who was exiled for five years in Kazakhstan. ''This is something that never occurred before. It came at a very important time when we, as perpetual optimists, see an opportunity for the solution of our problem.'' A Concert Is Allowed **********Another hint of improvement was the news, announced by Vladimir Feltsman, a virtuoso pianist, that ''after eight years of silence'' imposed on him after he applied to emigrate, he was being allowed to give a concert in Moscow on April 21, at Tchaikovsky Hall. **********Not everyone was as sanguine, however. Some cited an article in the newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya in early April asserting that the reason Western leaders wanted the would-be emigres out was what that they possessed state secrets. Some said they saw in this the seeds of a campaign to smear the Jewish dissidents with espionage charges. **********No Secretary of State had done anything like this before. In the past, when Mr. Shultz and his predecessors were in Moscow for high-level talks on arms control, they calculated that meeting dissidents would sour the atmosphere and damage the talks. **********Nor was Mr. Shultz's visit timed for Passover. It was just coincidental, officials said, that his arrival today fell on the eve of Passover. For the last two years, the embassy has held a seder for Jews who have been refused permission to emigrate, and when Mr. Shultz was asked if he wished to attend, he agreed. **********Jewish emigration, having reached a high of more than 51,000 in 1979, has fallen to a trickle in recent years, with a slight rise last month. **********The kosher food and wine was brought in on Mr. Shultz's plane. About 75 people, one-third of them Americans, were seated at round tables in the ballroom of the mansion that serves as Ambassador Jack F. Matlock's residence. 'We Are With You' **********The blessing was said over the wine by Michael Einik, an economics officer at the embassy, who conducted the seder. Then Mr. Shultz said a few words before departing for further evening meetings with Soviet officials on arms control. He did not stay for the main ceremony. **********''We never stop,'' he told the would-be emigres. ''And if our hopes are disappointed, we keep on. We think about you, we pray for you, and we are with you. On every occasion we meet with the Soviets we will always bring this subject up, and they know it.'' **********''Whether it seems to be a time of hope or a time of disappointment,'' Mr. Shultz said, ''our effort is always there.

By comparison, for all of last year the 30-stock blue-chip index gained 349 points, or 22.6 percent. **********Larry M. Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said there was no specific news yesterday to account for the advance. **********But at least two factors apparently eased Wall Street's worry about interest rates, helping stocks of rate-sensitive industries. For one thing, demand was stronger than expected for this week's Treasury refunding, a development that sent rates lower yesterday and lifted bond prices sharply. In addition, there were new rumors of a Japanese rate cut, perhaps as early as next week. Possible Causes for Gain **********''Some could say the Treasury's $29 billion refunding auctions helped market sentiment because its issues were absorbed without any impact on interest rates,'' Mr. Wachtel said, ''or that the expected cut in the Japanese discount rate buoyed not only the autos, but the overall market.'' **********But Mr. Wachtel dismissed the view offered by some experts that the market's midsession retreat was caused by the unsupported reports that Terry Waite, the Church of England envoy, had been killed or wounded in Lebanon. **********''At these market levels we should expect pullbacks, and perhaps welcome them,'' he said, ''because mini-corrections tend to wring out some of the emotional buying and, indeed, give everyone a needed pause to reflect.'' **********While yesterday's trading was very heavy, the volume still fell far short of the record 302.4 million shares traded Jan. 23. **********''Contributing to the heavy volume was the sharp shift in market direction during the session,'' said William M. LeFevre, market strategist at Advest Inc. ''At 1:30, for example, the Dow was up 19.12 points, its intraday high. An hour later, it was down 8.02 points, a swing of more than 27 points, before resuming its advance.'' **********Asked how long the market's current rally would continue, Mr. LeFevre said, ''Who knows?'' He pointed out that International Business Machines, General Motors and American Telephone and Telegraph - three top blue-chip stocks consistently run down by analysts in recent weeks - helped lead yesterday's advance. **********G.M.'s stock, reflecting rumors that the big auto maker planned to buy back some shares and raise its dividend, led the Big Board's most-active list, rising 1 5/8, to 80, on a turnover of almost 5.7 million shares.

I.B.M., trading ex-dividend, jumped 2 7/8, to 136 7/8, and was fourth most active. **********Other auto stocks were also strong: Ford advanced 2 1/2, to 79 1/2, and Chrysler gained 1/2, to 50 1/4. **********Monte Gordon, research director at the Dreyfus Corporation, said he was uneasy about the market's behavior after the advance resumed in the last 90 minutes of trading. **********''True, the market, as measured by the major indexes, did manage to close above 2,200, but just by a squeak,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''The recovery had none of the powerful drive that marked trading earlier in the day.'' Liquidity May Be High **********But Mr. Gordon was not yet ready to predict a significant downturn, particularly because of high investor liquidity, which has been a primary ingredient in the market's rise this year. Much of this excess cash resulted from year-end stock selling by investors seeking to take advantage of favorable tax treatment under the old tax law. **********''When will we see a real correction?'' he continued.

Gregorio Honasan, called opposition to Mrs. Aquino ''an initial necessary step'' to save the nation from what he described as a drift toward the abuses of the former President, Ferdinand E. Marcos. **********Mrs. Aquino's spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, issued a response calling the rebels ''self-appointed messiahs and demagogues'' whose uprising was ''a naked power grab by a man using honeyed words to mask the military dictatorship he would set up.''

'No Intention' of Killing Aquino **********The colonel said that he had not intended to kill Mrs. Aquino, as she has charged, and that he called off his rebellion to halt mounting military casualties. **********''We had no intention of harming the President or her family,'' he said. ''It was politically untenable to do so against a leader that is perceived to be popular, sincere and committed, no matter how misguided and incapable she might be.'' **********A separate unsigned document purporting to come from Colonel Honasan's group and delivered to news organizations set forth a vaguely worded nine-point program of government by what it described as a seven-member ''Ruling Junta of the Nationalist Provisional Government under the Armed Forces of the Philippines.'' **********It was the second such document purporting to come from a military junta. Colonel Honasan did not mention such a group in his address. **********A diplomat who has had close relations with Colonel Honasan's group said the language of the document seen today appeared to reflect the thoughts and writings of one of his confederates in the mutiny.

Colonel Escaped **********The Government says more than 1,100 rebel soldiers were captured or surrendered. Colonel Honasan escaped, as did other officers identified as leaders of the mutiny. **********Today there were still indications that considerable support remained for the rebel soldiers within the military. **********At Villamor Air Base, headquarters of the Philippine Air Force, troops reportedly told Vice President Salvador H. Laurel that they favored an amnesty for the mutineers.

Comparison to Marcos Regime **********Colonel Honasan said the Aquino Government, which he helped install by spearheading a military revolt against the Marcos regime in February 1986, had betrayed his expectations in its military policies, and by allowing corruption, nepotism and politics to swamp any useful programs. **********''The incumbent administration has consciously taken the same direction as that of the then-popular Marcos administration at the start,'' he said.

Longer-range transport would come from the Air Force's Special Operations Wing. How They Got to the Gulf **********An account of how the Army helicopters got to the Persian Gulf and what they have done was pieced together from Administration officials who asked not to be named, from briefings and a press pool report filed from the gulf yesterday. **********Task Force 160's helicopters were sent from their base at Fort Campbell, Ky., to the gulf in June at the request of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who had become concerned about maritime guerrilla warfare. **********Admiral Crowe, who commanded the Mideast Force of United States warships in the gulf 10 years ago, became anxious after an Iraqi fighter fired missiles at the American frigate Stark in May, killing 37 sailors. He worreid that American warships might be vulnerable to attack by Iranian speed-boats; if they got too close, a warship might not be able to depress her guns quickly enough to hit the intruder. Aircraft Termed Answer **********Aircraft that could range well out from the ships seemed to be the answer. But Navy helicopters are rigged for minesweeping and anti-submarine operations, or for transport, and Navy aviators are not trained to attack with gunships. **********At first, Admiral Crowe asked the Marine Corps to take on the task with Harriers, airplanes that can take off and land vertically, in the same space used by a helicopter. But Gen. P. X. Kelley, then Commandant of the Marine Corps, demurred because the logistics effort would have been immense. **********Admiral Crowe turned to the Army, which subsequently assigned an undetermined number of gunships from Task Force 160. The aircraft were described as small, two-seater gunships that the maker, Hughes Aircraft, has claimed are the quietest helicopters in the world. **********The OH-6 helicopters are fitted with sensors and navigation devices that enable them to fly low and to hit targets at night. Their weapons include machine guns and rockets, and they can fly at 135 miles an hour with a range of 380 miles. #2 Based on Frigate Jarrett To prepare for duty in the Persian Gulf, the Army pilots trained with Navy ships off the coast of Virginia, then were flown with the gunships aboard Air Force cargo planes to the gulf. There they were distributed among the ships in the fleet, two of them being based aboard the frigate Jarrett. **********Meanwhile, Admiral Crowe visited the Persian Gulf earlier this month and discussed with Rear Adm. Harold J. Bernsen, the commander of the American force there, the possibility of actions like that which took place this week. Admiral Bernsen told him the helicopters were ready. **********Under the rules of engagement, Admiral Bernsen is authorized to order his forces, including the helicopters, to fire if he determines there is ''hostile intent,'' meaning the threat of imminent use of force against ships flying American flags. **********Hostile intent was defined as maneuvering by a ship or aircraft so that it could fire a missile, drop a bomb or use gunfire. A radar lock-on by a ship's fire control system was also defined to constitute hostile intent. Defined as Hostile Act **********The rules of engagement define a ''hostile act'' as one in which an aircraft, ship or land forces launch a missile, shoot a gun or drop a bomb. Admiral Bernsen said the Iranian ship had committed a hostile act by laying mines in an anchorage used by American warships. **********In Monday's episode, the admiral suggested that the Iranian ship, called Iran Ajr by the Pentagon but Rakhsh by reporters who boarded her in the gulf, had been under surveillance since she left port at Bandar Abbas, an Iranian naval base at the eastern edge of the gulf. **********He said the ship was tracked across the gulf by radar but that the mines were spotted, evidently by aviators who flew close to the ship, when the crew removed a tarpaulin covering them. **********When night fell, the Iranian ship was kept under surveillance by two Army helicopters from the frigate Jarrett. The pilots could see the minelayer through night vision goggles that are powered by tiny amounts of light from stars or a manmade source. Stopped for 34 Minutes **********About 11 P.M. on Monday, Persian Gulf time, the pilots reported they had seen the Iranian crew drop one or two mines over the side of their ship. The admiral ordered the helicopters to open fire, which they did with machine guns and rockets. **********The Iranians stopped laying mines for 34 minutes, then resumed. This time the helicopters cut loose with a barrage that set the Iranian vessel afire and left it dead in the water. As reported earlier, three Iranians were killed, four were wounded and two are missing. **********A press dispatch described ''a ship pocked by machine-gun fire and stained with blood. Windows in the bridge were shattered, rooms ransacked and personal belongings were strewn about the living quarters.'' The gunfire pierced oil barrels and the mines on deck. **********''Two large holes on the port and starboard sides of the hull and an angled six-inch wide gash that ripped through the deck near the bow'' indicated where the ship had come under rocket attack, the report said. An American naval officer, stepping over shattered glass on the bridge, was quoted: ''I wouldn't have wanted to be on this ship last night.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/16/world/arms-dealers-linked-to-us-policy-shift.html": {"writer_name": "Jeff Gerth", "pub_date": "1987-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARMS DEALERS LINKED TO U.S. POLICY SHIFT", "print_headline": "ARMS DEALERS LINKED TO U.S. POLICY SHIFT", "body_text": " **********For more than a year before the Reagan Administration began to consider selling arms to Iran, many of the arms dealers who eventually helped carry out the change in policy had been planning among themselves to sell American arms to the Teheran Government, according to American and Iranian sources and documents. **********The discussions suggest that the official policy of the United States may have been heavily influenced by earlier plans of arms brokers who had their own commercial aims. **********One of these brokers, Manucher Ghorbanifar, was planning in early 1984 to sell United States weapons to Iran, even though such sales were officially banned by the United States, according to associates. **********In 1985, Mr. Ghorbanifar became the major source of intelligence about Iran for the United States. His observations and advice helped persuade the White House to proceed with the arms sales, even though the Central Intelligence Agency had decided he was unreliable, American officials said. Hearings May Study Dealers **********The Administration's dependency on these middlemen is likely to be a focus of Congressional investigations of the Iran affair, since no arms dealers or middlemen were interviewed in the first set of hearings last year. **********Even without evidence from these men, the still-secret Senate report on the matter criticized the Administration for depending on arms brokers, officials said. **********Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee when it put together its report, said the report showed that the Administration had been taken in by a combination of ''someone else's foreign policy and the avarice of arms dealers.'' **********What made this arrangement possible, officials said, was that the desire of the arms brokers to make deals and reap large profits meshed with the Administration's desire to be told by them that Iran would bring about the release of American hostages held in Lebanon if weapons were delivered to Teheran. 'No Suggestion of Risks' **********In a recent interview Gary Sick, who handled Iran affairs at the National Security Council under President Jimmy Carter and is now at the Ford Foundation, said that a White House memo dated Jan. 17, 1986, giving the rationale for the arms sales, ''has no suggestion of downside risks, of the implications, no sense of broader policy concerns.'' **********''The policy makers had no good answers for freeing the hostages,'' Mr. Sick added. So the arms dealers, who are ''entrepreneurs who believe in the ability to cut a deal,'' he said, came along ''with a policy, and that becomes your policy.'' **********President Reagan has said the Iran initiative began in mid-1985, while Robert C. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, has told Congress it was in July 1985 that he first discussed with Mr. Reagan the possibility of selling arms to Iran, according to Congressional officials. U.S. Sponsorship Sought **********The Senate report, according to Congressional sources, says that the first discussions among some of the dealers and an Israeli official who later became involved in the Administration's Iran arms deals took place late in 1984. But earlier that year, in April or May, some of the same arms dealers planned during meetings in London to sell United States arms to Iran. **********In those discussions they said they hoped they could arrange for official United States sponsorship of the sales. One dealer said he had heard indications that the United States might soon consider changing its policy, according to an arms dealer familiar with the discussions who asked not to be identified, and to Ali Noorizadeh, an Iranian journalist based in London who was present for some of the discussions. **********These early 1984 discussions included three Iranian exiles involved in the arms trade, Mr. Ghorbanifar, Albert Hakim and Cyrus Hashemi, according to these sources. Mr. Hakim and his companies helped handle the proceeds from the sale of United State arms to Iran last year authorized by the Reagan Administration, and Congressional investigators believe his companies may have taken large commissions from the sales. **********Mr. Hashemi, who died last July, was involved in the early stages of the Government-sponsored arms sales but then became entangled in an unauthorized arms deal. 'Americans Ready to Sell Arms' **********Mr. Noorizadeh said Mr. Hashemi told him after a meeting with Mr. Ghorbanifar in London in April 1984 that the two men planned to ''go and buy weapons through Albert Hakim in the U.S. and sell them to Iran.'' **********In London the next month, Mr. Noorizadeh said, Mr. Hashemi told him that ''Hakim said that the Americans are ready to sell arms to Iran, they're thinking of trying to win some friends in Iran.'' **********Since the early 1980's, Mr. Hakim has tried to do business with Iran and to persuade the Reagan Administration to improve relations with Iran, according to former employees of Mr. Hakim, including Herman Neidhart. **********At the time of his discussions in London, Mr. Hakim was in business with retired Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, who has emerged as a key figure in the Iran affair. Mr. Hakim and his lawyer both declined to comment. Link to Iran Rescue Mission **********Mr. Hashemi and Mr. Hakim were already known to American intelligence agencies. They had been involved in sensitive intelligence activities for the United States in 1980, including the ill-fated attempt in April 1980 to rescue the American hostages in Teheran, a mission that also involved Mr. Secord, according to associates. **********In November 1984, Mr. Ghorbanifar had separate discussions in Hamburg, West Germany, with a former top C.I.A. official, Theodore G. Shackley, according to several participants. At the meetings, they talked about freeing the hostages in Lebanon, arms sales to Iran and improved relations between the two countries, the sources added. **********Mr. Shackley sent a memo about the meeting to Administration officials and suggested that Mr. Ghorbanifar might serve as an intermediary between the United States and Iran, according to the sources. **********It is unclear what happened to the memo, but one of the people who became aware of it in early 1985 was Michael Ledeen, a Government consultant and a friend of Mr. Shackley, the sources said. Ghorbanifar Tied to Israeli **********In the spring of 1985, Mr. Ledeen was working as a consultant for the National Security Council and met in Israel with, among others, Mr. Ghorbanifar and Yaacov Nimrodi, an Israeli arms dealer. Mr. Ledeen's advice when he returned to Washington helped the Administration decide whether to proceed with the arms sales to Iran. **********The Senate report, according to Congressional officials, notes that in late 1984 Mr. Ghorbanifar also had discussions in Israel with three others who later became involved in the United States arms sales. They were Mr. Nimrodi, Al Schwimmer, a founder of Israel's aircraft industry, and David Kimche, a high Israeli official. **********Mr. Ghorbanifar, according to officials, told the Israelis that arms were needed to strengthen the standing of moderate elements in Iran."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/28/business/business-technology-printouts-technical-workers-snarled-by-tax-law.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 317, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Technical Workers Snarled by Tax Law", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY: PRINTOUTS; Technical Workers Snarled by Tax Law", "body_text": " **********Scores of engineers, designers, computer programmers, systems analysts or other similarly skilled workers who make a living as independent consultants are planning to march on Washington tomorrow to protest a tax amendment that hurts them, confuses their employers and apparently puzzles the Government as well. **********The amendment, Section 1706, was introduced by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, in the closing hours of the debate on the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and took effect Jan. 1.

But Detroit's new, longer warranties will add costs and risk resentment when consumers discover how limited they actually are. **********With all three manufacturers offering extended warranties, analysts said that any additional marketing clout had been canceled out.

In addition, the company would extend the warranty on body rust to six years and 100,000 miles. AUTO industry analysts called the move an effort by G.M. to divert attention from the company's recent quality problems, such as diesel engines that failed prematurely and transmissions that needed frequent repair. Analysts generally said that the longer warranties should be looked upon as a sales incentive that does not cost as much as rebates or subsidized interest programs, which run into hundreds of dollars a car. ''G.M. made the move because they were the ones who had the problem with their quality reputation,'' said Harvey Heinbach, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. Both the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation have claimed to have the best quality among the domestic producers and have surveys to back the claims. Significantly, G.M. has not attempted to refute them. Poor quality is just one of the problems that has sent G.M. into a sharp decline in recent years. The auto maker has had trouble establishing a distinctive image, and many of its new car lines have flopped. **********Last year, Ford surpassed G.M. in earnings for the first time since 1924. Ford reported 1986 earnings of $3.3 billion while G.M. earned only $2.95 billion. And this year may be a repeat: so far, G.M.'s sales have been 33 percent below last year's level. **********Warranties aside, how much have American auto makers improved their cars? Most experts agree that the American companies have narrowed, but not closed, the quality gap with most imports. Measurement is difficult because no one agrees on a definition of quality. Confidential auto industry surveys that measure ''things gone wrong'' with new cars consistently put the Japanese on top. IN A measure of consumer satisfaction with automobile performance conducted by the J. D. Power firm, the Japanese companies averaged 134 on an index where the overall average was 100, while the American industry stood at 90. **********Chrysler officials say that soothing customer apprehension was the reason they began offering a five-year, 50,000-mile extended warranty in 1982. The company had just barely avoided bankruptcy and was still awash in bad publicity. **********Since that offer, Chrysler's share of the market for American cars has grown from 11.9 percent to 14.2 percent last year. Some Chrysler executives credit chairman Lee A. Iacocca's punchy ''best built, best backed'' television commercials with finally goading G.M. into touching off the warranty war. Buyers who know little about automobiles are the most likely to be swayed by an attractive warranty, Mr. Power said. **********Ford has had a growing reputation for improved quality in recent years and was not eager to go beyond its existing three-year, unlimited mileage powertrain coverage. Nevertheless, ''we had to keep our dealers competitive,'' said Ross Roberts, marketing manager for the Ford Division. Ford matched G.M. at six years and 60,000 miles and Chrysler followed with seven-year, 70,000-mile coverage on cars and light trucks as well. All have the 100,000-mile corrosion warranty. **********But all three will have to bear the added cost of longer warranties. How much more? The auto companies usually refuse to say anything about warranty costs because the figures could be used by competitors to back claims of higher quality; they declined to respond to inquiries on the recent warranty extension. Sources close to G.M., though, say the company is estimating its cost for the extension at about $85 a car. Costs for the other companies should be comparable or less, they added. **********The modest cost has as much to do with the fine print on the warranties as improved car quality, industry watchers say. The Big Three warranties only cover the engine, transmission and parts that transmit power to the wheels, usually the most durable components in a car. Notably uncovered after the one-year, 12,000-mile basic warranty runs out are suspension and breaking systems, power assists and heating and cooling systems. And the extended warranties require the owner to pay $100 each time warranty work is done. **********''There's not much cost because there's not that much coverage,'' said Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney. ''These are limited warranties covering the parts of the car that don't blow up very often.'' DETROIT executives argue that the new warranties are a good value for customers because they protect against catastrophic failure of the most expensive parts of a car and are now long enough that the typical new car buyer - who usually trades in a car within five years -will be covered for as long as he owns his automobile. **********But one senior industry offical said surveys have shown that most people would prefer a warranty that covers the car's ability to function, not just certain components, even if the coverage were for a shorter period. ''What people really want is three and 36 on everything and no baloney,'' he said. (Some European manufacturers offer that type of protection.) Indeed, some analysts say that by emphasizing the length of the warranty coverage and consigning the limitations to the fine print, the auto companies risk irritating buyers when a car breaks down and they find that the part involved is not covered. ''A lot of people are going to misinterpret what is covered and what is not and feel a little cheated when the warranty doesn't deliver,'' said Thomas F. O'Grady, a marketing consultant. Big Three executives say that the new warranties are planned as a permanent part of their marketing plans, and that the coverage will not drop back to previous levels after a few years, as happened in the late 1960's. And, they said, the longer warranties will put pressure on the importers of Japanese cars to match the extended coverage. **********Importers, their margins squeezed by the increase in the value of the yen, are not eager to add anything to their costs. They say they hope the quality reputation of Japanese cars is good enough that buyers will not demand longer warranties. **********The Japanese affiliates of both G.M. and Chrysler have also refused to lengthen the warranties on the Japanese-made cars sold under American brand names. That means, for example, that a Chevrolet Sprint will have a three-year, 36,000-mile powertrain warranty, while a Celebrity will have the longer protection -which may create some confusion in the showroom. **********The importers of high-priced European cars already use longer, fuller warranties as marketing tools. Mercedes-Benz, for example, provides four-year, 50,000-mile coverage on almost everything and makes roadside assistance part of the plan. An extended warranty helps justify the purchase of a car costing $25,000 or more, said an official of an importer of German cars. People who pay that much money for an automobile like to be coddled, he added.  AN OLD TECHNIQUE APPLIED IN NEW WAYS **********When Richard W. Sears sold watches and jewlery by mail order in 1887, he had to persuade farmers to purchase his goods sight unseen. His catalogue promised refunds on unsatisfactory merchandise. The strategy worked. Eventually, the Sears, Roebuck & Company warranty slogan would become the most famous of its kind -''Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back.'' **********The objectives of warranties have changed little since 1887. But in recent years, chemical, electronics and even credit card companies have made increasing use of warranties as a marketing tool. **********American Express, for example, will double the manufacturer's warranty (up to an extra year) on any product bought with its card. The program began in 1986 as a four-month experiment; but it was so popular that the company extended it until the end of 1987, and it may become permanent. About 75,000 warranty submissions have been filed. Items purchased under the program range from computers to curling irons. ''One woman wanted to know if the warranty applied to her live- stock,'' said Sarah Mullen, a company spokeswoman. ''We told her we could not cover her cow.'' **********Manufacturing companies are also finding innovative ways to apply warranties. The Monsanto Company guarantees the apparel, upholstery and carpet that contain the company's nylon fibers. The warranty period ranges from one to five years. The company investigates claims, for such things as discoloration of rugs or torn clothes, to determine where the fault lies. ''Most claims are valid,'' said Earl Bransfield, a Monsanto vice president. ''We're looking for repeat business, and this is a positive marketing tool.'' **********Service industries have also discovered new uses for warranties. At Holiday Inns, for example, if the hotel manager cannot solve a customer complaint - insufficient towels or a broken television, for example - then the hotel will return part or all of the cost of the room. The Holiday Inn on the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean goes further: it guarantees the weather. Guests who buy a weekend scuba-diving package are reimbursed if bad weather prevents them from getting their scheduled dives.  - JAMES HIRSCH"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/01/business/bid-for-sakowitz.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bid for Sakowitz", "print_headline": "Bid for Sakowitz", "body_text": " **********Australia's Hooker Corporation would acquire 80 percent of financially beleaguered Sakowitz Inc., the Houston-based retailer, under an amended plan of organization filed in Federal Bankruptcy Court.

And I take it that it was your understanding, from what you've just said, that quite to the contrary, you were authorized to seek money from foreign countries? **********A. I was authorized to do everything that I did. Q. Well, again, that isn't the question. A. I was authorized to have a meeting, in this particular case in specific by Mr. McFarlane, for the purpose of talking to the man about a suggestion that had been made to him by others, and to encourage that process along. And I did so. I had already provided to Mr. McFarlane a card with the address of an account, an offshore account which would support the Nicaraguan resistance. And thank God, somebody put money into that account and the Nicaraguan resistance didn't die - as perhaps others intended. Certainly the Sandinistas and Moscow and Cuba intended that.

Both analysts rate National Semiconductor as a ''hold.'' Ms. Eraiba said, ''However, we like the stock at these prices.'' But Thomas P. Kurlak of Merrill Lynch is more cautious on prospects for the group. ''These stocks appear fairly priced,'' he said. ''We think they will move in line with the overall market for the next three to six months.'' **********On Oct. 14, Mr. Kurlak lowered his investment opinion on the stocks from ''buy'' to ''neutral.'' He said: ''At that time, the high stock prices for semiconductor companies already had discounted the 1988 recovery.

For National Semiconductor, the analyst projects profits at 50 cents a share for the fiscal year ending May 1988 and at 85 cents the following fiscal year. **********Ms. Eraiba of Salomon Brothers carries higher earnings estimates for 1988. Her estimate on Motorola, for example, remains at $3.75 a share. **********In yesterday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Texas Instruments rose 67.5 cents a share, to $41, while National Semiconductor gained 37.5 cents, to $11.75. Motorola fell 50 cents, to $40. The most active issue in the over-the-counter market, Intel, rose 67.5 cents, to $22.75. **********This contrasted with the spectacular performance of these issues in late September, when they rose swiftly to record high prices. At that time, many money managers were changing the makeup of their portfolios by selling interest-sensitive stocks like electric utilities and buying cyclical issues like the semiconductors that were seen as beneficiaries of an improving economy. The price of Texas Instruments surged to $80.25 and Motorola fetched as high as $74 in the closing days of September. Similarly, National Semiconductor climbed to $22.25 and Intel traded at $41.75, after adjustment for a recent 3-for-2 stock split. **********On Wall Street, semiconductor stocks have a reputation of behaving like a feast-or-famine group. From June 1983 until October 1986 these issues underperformed the general run of stocks and, for part of this period, they actually were in a bear market of their own. Between 1983 and 1985, for example, Texas Instruments saw the price of its shares cut in half. **********Stuart M. Johnson of Wertheim Schroder & Company believes that semiconductor issues, in a sense, are being punished in the market on the basis of their past performance during a business downturn. ''This was notably true in 1985 and 1986, when few companies except for Motorola escaped losing money,'' he said. ''But today the industry is in far better shape. There has been no buying binge by customers and the chip makers themselves are in far better financial condition.'' **********He sees the shares of Intel, Motorola, National Semiconductor and Texas Instruments as ''offering excellent value.'' Mr. Johnson is not predicting a recession, but he noted that ''the semiconductor industry has never been in a better position to weather a recession.'' **********At E.F. Hutton & Company, Edward C. White Jr. ranks Motorola and Intel as his two favorites. ''Motorola is more broadly based in its operations than most semiconductor companies,'' he said.

The 177-year-old army, which has dominated power and politics for most of the last half-century, feels that it is under siege by a society that it believes is reacting ungratefully to the armed forces' role in putting down leftist subversion during the 1970's. A 'Boiling Kettle' **********A foreign diplomat in contact with top military officers said the unhappiness within the armed forces, particularly the army, over their declining status was so great that it had the potential to turn into a ''boiling kettle.'' **********The Congress completed action last week on legislation to greatly reduce the number of military officers facing trial in connection with the killings, kidnappings and other abuses committed during the counterinsurgency. But military officers, politicians and others with military contacts said in interviews they doubted that would be enough to satisfy the military. **********The man in the parka and three additional army captains, all in their 30's, talked about their grievances in a three-hour interview granted on the condition that their names not be published. All four said they had taken part in the takeover of an infantry school at the Campo de Mayo military base near here during a series of army rebellions over Easter. **********The mutinies were quieted after President Raul Alfonsin intervened, but they resulted in a shakeup of army leadership. An estimated three-fourths of the officer corps had refused to obey orders from that leadership to move against the rebellion. **********Immediately after the crisis, the President initiated the legislation that is intended to limit the trials to those who were involved in drafting the orders that led to the disappearance of an estimated 9,000 people and the torture of many more during the ''dirty war'' against leftists. **********The captains, who said they had not been charged in any of the human-rights cases, expressed difficulty in accepting that the toll from the counterinsurgency was that high, or that the campaign may have been directed against people who had not been engaged in violence. The 9,000 figure refers to those estimated to have been detained by the police or the military and who have never been seen again; it was produced by an investigative commission created by Mr. Alfonsin. Recalling President's Order **********One of the captains recalled the military's contention that the Government of President Isabel Martinez de Peron, before it was overthrown by the military in 1976, had ordered the armed forces to annihilate the guerrillas. While the meaning of those orders has been the subject of sharp debate in recent years among civilians, the captain said that to a military officer, ''there's no doubt what that term means.'' **********Another of the captains said the legislation just passed by Congress ''is perhaps a step forward from the perspective that it will diminish the parade of military officers before the courts and all of that, but it does not go to the depth of the question. That is, plainly and simply, that the country should say, 'There was a war here; the armed forces were engaged in it as the result of a political decision, under constitutional orders; and a political solution, not a juridical one, is what must be found now.' '' **********He and the other captains, who defended the events of the 1970's as necessary for the national good, said their complaints went beyond the question of the trials and were based on the fear that the continued existence of the army itself was at stake. They asserted that some members of President Alfonsin's party, the Radical Civic Union, and some human-rights advocates wanted to dismantle the army. **********Dr. Ricardo Felgueras, staff director of the Senate Defense Committee, who deals regularly with the military, said this fear was widespread within the army and not only among those who took part in the mutinies. He acknowledged that some in the party have said privately that the country might not need a military, but he didn't indicate what might have been proposed to take its place. 'Most Serious Problem' **********Dr. Felgueras also asserted that some of the problems have originated within the army, which he said was racked by self-doubt. **********''The most serious problem of the Argentine Army,'' he said, ''is that it doesn't know what it exists for. At this point, there is virtually no possibility of external conflict, not with Brazil, Chile or Britain, but this is an army that is accustomed to running something -industry, the Government, the instruments of repression. So now, mentalities have to be changed.'' **********Dr. Felgueras said that, as a result of the April rebellions, the army was still ''fractured'' by a split between high-ranking officers and those of the rank of lieutenant colonel and below. The captains that were interviewed. however, indicated that the new chief of staff, Gen. Jose Dante Caridi, had shown the capacity to quickly understand the source of the internal unrest. **********The Alfonsin Government has said it wants to reduce the size of the armed forces and to make them more modern and professional. At the same time, the Government wants to create a military that is more responsive to civilian authority and less inclined to intervene in politics. **********One step that the Government recently took was to have the entire officer corps swear allegiance to the Constitution. In the past, military men that were being sworn in or that were being promoted swore allegiance to the country and flag, but not to the Constitution. Impact on the Budget **********But, so far, the greatest impact of the Government's policies on the armed forces has been in budget reductions. A year ago, the Defense Ministry said that the military budget had been cut about one-third in the preceding three years, and that military spending as a percentage of the nation's annual output of goods and services was about half the level in 1983 - down to slightly more than 2 percent from 4.6 percent. **********The budget restraints have led to complaints within the military that there is not enough money to buy or maintain equipment, or even to conduct regular exercises. The captains, for example, asserted that the army would not be prepared should it be needed for an operation, such as against drug traffickers. **********They also said their salaries of about $250 a month were not only far below the levels of the years under military government, but also the levels of the last constitutional government. They contended that the salaries, which are well below those paid to middle managers in the private sector, could adversely affect morale and lead to the loss of top officers, further weakening the military. **********The armed forces are thought to have about 75,000 men, half of the number that fought the war with Britain in 1982 over control of the Falkland Islands, which are called the Malvinas here. The officer corps has been reduced by attrition, and the ranks by a dramatic drop in conscription. **********The captains also complained about what they characterized as a press campaign to discredit the military. **********A foreign diplomat said that for all of these reasons, the armed forces feel defanged. **********The captains said that the takeover of the infantry school was the result of frustration that had been brewing for a long time, and that the previous army leadership had not been responding to it. Warnings of 'Instability' **********The leader of the Campo de Mayo uprising, Lieut. Col. Aldo Rico, had written a letter two months earlier to his immediate superior, the commander of the 12th Infantry Brigade, warning that the possibility of trials, the low salaries and equipment shortages, and the criticism by the press were creating a ''dangerous instability'' in the army. **********Colonel Rico urged his superiors to demand a full amnesty on the human-rights charges, even though he said amnesty was ''ignominious'' for a military that ''fought a just and necessary war'' - a position supported by the four captains. He asserted that an amnesty was necessary to preserve constitutional order, and he said that the army should not delay while other officers were imprisoned, but that it should ''confront the problem in a decisive manner.'' **********As many as 450 active-duty and retired officers could face trial on charges brought by human-rights groups. It is not yet clear how many would be freed from the prospect of trial under the new legislation. **********So far, 10 men have been tried and given prison sentences. This includes five former military commanders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/04/world/indian-flotilla-is-turned-back-by-sri-lankan-naval-vessels.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1987-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 723, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDIAN FLOTILLA IS TURNED BACK BY SRI LANKAN NAVAL VESSELS", "print_headline": "INDIAN FLOTILLA IS TURNED BACK BY SRI LANKAN NAVAL VESSELS", "body_text": " **********An Indian flotilla of fishing boats bound for northern Sri Lanka with food and medicine for ethnic Tamils abruptly called off its mission tonight and turned back after Sri Lankan naval vessels barred it from proceeding. **********The Indian action, averting what diplomats and others had feared might become a military confrontation between the two countries, came after more than four hours of tense negotiations aimed at defusing the crisis atmosphere of the last several days. **********Adding to the dangerous atmosphere were reports that several Indian warships were stationed in India's territorial waters near the likely scene of confrontation, ready to move if Sri Lanka had done anything provocative. #19 Unarmed Fishing Boats Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India had directed the creation of the flotilla to bring relief to Tamil areas subjected in recent weeks to aerial bombardment and naval shelling in a Sri Lankan Government offensive against Tamil separatist guerrillas. **********While Indian and Sri Lankan officials discussed possible compromises, the 19 unarmed fishing boats laden with medicine and food and carrying more than 100 journalists, remained anchored in the dark seas off the tiny Sri Lankan island of Kachchativu. **********Their location was about midway in a 30-mile stretch of the Palk Strait between the two countries' shorelines.

They then turned the boats around and headed back to Rameswaram, an ancient port city from which the flotilla had set out early in the afternoon. **********The episode marked one of India's most dramatic confrontations with a small neighboring country in recent years.

But Colombo maintains that at no time was there a threat of force, arguing that for Sri Lanka to do so would invite retaliation and and almost certain defeat.

The guerrillas in fact control most of the peninsula. **********The widely contradictory claims on casualties have not been verified because Sri Lanka has barred reporters, diplomats and others from inspecting the damage from its offensive. **********Army officials acknowledged that in their sweep, they had taken 3,500 Tamil youths into custody, virtually the entire young male population of the sector that was the target of the offensive. **********The planned Indian relief mission had marked the first time that India had proposed to intervene directly in Sri Lankan affairs. **********Sri Lanka is dominated by ethnic Sinhalese, who are Buddhists. **********It was uncertain tonight whether the confrontation that ended in the Palk Strait might spur a new effort to mediate the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict.

Yet, Mr. D'Avenzo makes it a point to study carefully the structure of any program he is offered, in order to see just how the profits are divided. **********''The general partner put the deal together, for which he's entitled to something,'' Mr. D'Avenzo said. ''But it's my money and the other limited partners' money that is really getting the deal to go. We should be getting a very big share in the program.'' **********The concern expressed by Mr. D'Avenzo is typical of that felt by many purchasers of limited partnership units these days, with tax revision having reduced the tax benefits long associated with this investment category. The economics of a transaction are now generally the driving element, and any conflicts - actual or potential - between the general partner and the limited partners should be especially considered before participating in such a partnership. **********Limited partnerships are a form of business organization used in fields such as real estate, oil and gas, and equipment leasing that consists of two basic entities. The general partner is usually the sponsor and manager of the project, while the limited partners invest all or most of the money, are liable only for the amount of their investment and are not involved in day-to-day management. **********A total of $16.7 billion worth of units in these partnerships was sold last year, a decline of 12 percent from 1985, according to Robert A. Stanger & Company, which provides limited partnership statistics and research. In 1987, however, Stanger believes that sales will advance between 8 and 12 percent, bringing still more investors who seek an above-average return into the partnership market. ''Both the general partner and the limited partners are seeking to maximize the short-term economic potential of the assets, as well as the long-term value,'' said Joseph Kavanau, executive vice president of Concord Assets Group, which sponsors limited partnerships that invest in shopping centers. ''So, economically, they're in bed together.'' **********Regardless of the motivation that brings the parties together in a limited partnership arrangement, there are certain aspects of a typical deal that pull them apart. And those factors - which are another reason that limited partnership investing is more complex than investing in stocks or bonds - ought to be understood before engaging in this activity. **********''For the most part, the limited partner shares identical interests with the general partner,'' said Christopher L. Davis, president of the Investment Partnership Association, the trade association for partnerships. ''However, spelled out in the partnership agreement are important distinctions that can involve distribution of the income stream and the allocation of the capital gain when an asset is sold.'' **********In a usual arrangement, the limited partners may receive between 90 and 99 percent of the benefits during the holding period of the partnership as cash distributions, with the remainder going to the general partner. At a successful liquidation or refinancing about 10 years later, the limited partners may get their investment back, plus a specified cumulative return of around 6 to 15 percent annually - along with 75 to 90 percent of whatever additional proceeds remain. Of course, there are often management fees to the sponsor and commissions to brokers that significantly reduce the amount of a limited partner's funds available for investment. **********A probable point of conflict between the two occurs when the general partner sells assets to the limited partnership. ''Where you're buying an asset from the general partner, how do you know you're paying a good price?'' asked William Turchyn, senior vice president of E. F. Hutton & Company. ''And what incentive is there for him to hang around and make it successful?'' **********Another danger could be in situations in which the sponsor operates a number of different corporations, with some doing business with affiliated limited partnerships. For example, if the general partner of a partnership also owns a mortgage loan company that lends money to this partnership, limited partners would have every right to wonder which of these entities is paramount to the sponsor. And if the sponsor is general partner in a group of limited partnerships, which one would come first when an attractive selling or buying opportunity arose? **********Another problem between a general partner and the limited partners could revolve around the sponsor's efforts to end the partnership arrangement too early. This possibility might develop when a sponsor is so anxious to obtain its contracted share of the capital appreciation that it terminates the partnership faster than necessary. **********These and other instances in which the interests of general and limited partners do not coincide indicate that individuals should be cautious when investing in limited partnerships. Financial advisers suggest that the sponsor's fee schedule, experience, track record and goals be carefully weighed in advance. It may be too late once you are already a limited partner."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/02/world/beirut-moslems-close-ranks-for-peace-bid-to-christians.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1987-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 950, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BEIRUT MOSLEMS CLOSE RANKS FOR PEACE BID TO CHRISTIANS", "print_headline": "BEIRUT MOSLEMS CLOSE RANKS FOR PEACE BID TO CHRISTIANS", "body_text": " **********Lebanon's main Moslem and Druse leaders, whose rival militias fought pitched battles on the streets of West Beirut only a week ago, announced today that they had closed ranks and had prepared a program that they would offer to the country's Christians in an effort to halt 12 years of civil war. **********The announcement was made by Prime Minister Rashid Karami after he and four other officials held two days of intensive talks with high-ranking Syrian Government leaders in Damascus. **********Also taking part on the Lebanese side were Hussein al-Husseini, the Speaker of Parliament; Education Minister Selim al-Hoss; Justice Minister Nabih Berri, and Public Works Minister Walid Jumblat. **********Mr. Berri heads the mainline Shiite Moslem movement Amal, whose fighters were pitted against Mr. Jumblat's Druse forces in six days of major clashes in the Moslem part of the Lebanese capital.

He said the program would be offered for consideration at negotiations with the Christian side. **********A team of political and military experts appointed by President Amin Gemayel, a Christian, has been holding consultations with the Syrian Vice President, Abdel Halim Khaddam, on ways to bring about reconciliation among the Lebanese factions and re-establish unity in the Lebanese Government. The team is led by a former Foreign Minister, Elie Salem, who is now a political consultant to President Gemayel. For several years, Syria has been the main power broker in Lebanon, and sometimes the mediator between factions. Moslems Boycott Cabinet **********The decision to negotiate with Christian leaders is the first positive sign since Moslem and Druse officials and politicians began a boycott of Governments meeting led by Mr. Gemayel. The boycott was called after Mr. Gemayel rejected an earlier Syrian-sponsored pact for political restructuring. **********The Moslem and Druse leaders are known to be pressing for an equal share in government with the Christians. They want the president's powers to be shifted to the Cabinet so Moslem and Christian ministers can exercise the executive authority collectively. **********The conciliatory mood in Damascus today was not matched in southern Lebanon, where rival factions within the Amal movement fought each other today on the main highway linking the ports of Sidon and Tyre. The highway was closed to traffic for several hours. **********A statement by the Amal leadership denied news reports that an uprising had occurred within Amal, Lebanon's largest Shiite militia. **********There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Gates's Role Was Questioned **********President Reagan nominated Mr. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence last February, but withdrew his name after questions were raised about his activities in the Iran-contra affair. The Congressional Iran-contra report named Mr. Gates and others in the agency as having received information, before it was made public, on the possibility that money from arms sales to Iran was being diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels. **********The Congressional hearings on the affair demonstrated that C.I.A. officials aided in air supply operations and provided other military assistance to the Nicaraguan rebels when it was against the law. **********The station chief in Costa Rica, Joe Fernandez, who was directly responsible to Mr. George, testified that he believed his actions were authorized by his superiors. Mr. George, in closed testimony that was declassified and made public, said he did not know that Mr. Fernandez and others were giving military help to the rebels. Senators' Criticism **********David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, the vice chairman, said that if Mr. George did not know of agents' activities, he should have known and should have stopped them. The Senators were members of the Iran-contra panel. **********Mr. Fernandez also testified that, under instructions from Mr. George, he had not responded fully to questions asked by President Reagan's special review board. Mr. George denied giving such instructions. **********The C.I.A. provided little background about Mr. George's career. It said that he had been with the agency for 32 years, that he had taken over agency operations in Greece in 1975 after the station chief, Richard Welch, was assassinated, and that he had been head of the C.I.A.'s office of congressional affairs before becoming Deputy Director for Operations in 1984. **********Mr. George graduated from Pennsylvania State University and was station chief in Beirut before going to Greece.

There were about 200 textile mills and enough jobs and money for everyone. The spinning jenny was invented here; William Hesketh Lever cut his first bar of soap here. **********Today, 114 of the mills still stand, but only five or six of them produce textiles. A few have been converted to other uses, but most stand empty, unlikely to have new tenants soon. And Bolton, 220 miles northwest of London with a population of 260,000 and an unemployment rate of nearly 16 percent, reflects many of the problems of the north of the country. **********In recent weeks, what is called the ''north-south division,'' stoked by Labor Party politicians in what is expected to be a national election year, has become a matter of national debate. **********Last month, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Bolton and told a friendly audience that things here looked fine. She was quoted as saying that ''I don't think there is anything like the north-south divide that people like to think.'' **********But in Bolton, which generally votes Labor like most northern industrial areas, the north-south division is taken as fact, in terms of economics and in terms of attitude. Neglect by the 'Soft' South **********The issue is hardly new. In the 1930's George Orwell, who wrote a book about this area called ''The Road to Wigan Pier,'' perceived ''a real difference between North and South, and there is at least a tinge of truth in that picture of Southern England as one enormous Brighton inhabited by lounge-lizards.'' **********Paul Woodmansey, Bolton's chief of industrial development planning, said ''the southerner is considered 'nesh,' '' a local word he defined as ''soft.'' **********Another factor is the perception in the north that it is ignored by the centers of power in London. When a city public relations official was told that there was unusually heavy snow in London, she said: ''That's why we're getting so much of it on TV. We can be snowed in for days up here and there is nothing.'' **********Northerners say London's neglect is manifest in the region's jobless rate. The Government admits that unemployment in the north remains much higher than in London and the southeast, where the rate is about 9 percent. But the Conservatives note that the northern jobless rate is leveling off. **********Labor Party officials, on the other hand, emphasize that since Mrs. Thatcher came to power in 1979, unemployment has soared in the north and hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs have vanished. They say that most of the several hundred thousand new jobs created in the country have been in the service industries in London and the southeast. **********Ian Symons, a Bolton industrial development planner, says that what happened to his city is clear. After World War II, other countries began to compete in textiles, but the textile jobs lost here were made up by a growing engineering equipment industry. Then that began to weaken, and Bolton's unemployment rate jumped to about 16 percent in 1980 and has stayed there, while the national average is about 13 percent. **********In recent years, the increase in service jobs in London and the south has outstripped efforts in the north to replace the old, moribund industries. North Seen as Bad Risk **********One reason, Mr. Symons said, is that Bolton no longer had any natural advantage, like the damp atmosphere that prevents textile thread from snapping under tension. And part of the problem is ''pure ignorance about what happens up here,'' he said. ''We're seen as a bad risk by the banks. The north is a risk, the south is the place to invest.'' **********Even Government programs to create new industry have hurt Bolton. Recently, an elevator manufacturer moved out of Bolton to set up near Liverpool, which has 19 percent unemployment, and where the company got a better deal under a Government redevelopment program. **********Northerners are rankled by Government proposals for major projects principally benefiting the south, like the plans to build a third airport for London and to dig a tunnel between England and France. **********Peter Thurnham, the only Conservative Member of Parliament from Bolton (the other two are Labor), defends the Government's position by noting that Government has promised to help expand the Manchester airport, which wants more international business, and that the Channel tunnel, widely known as the Chunnel, would be built with private investment. **********But Bob Howarth, the chairman of the Labor-controlled borough council, said that although the Chunnel is mostly a private enterprise, ''the Government is promoting it, a huge investment in the most inconvenient corner of our country.'' **********''The Government is London-based and London-centered and seems biased against the north,'' he added. Of Mrs. Thatcher's visit, he said: ''I'm pleased to see she's visiting the north. She's probably the most London-based Prime Minister we've had in a long time.'' **********At the Job Center, a municipal unemployment agency near Town Hall, an jobless graphic designer, Alex Kaicald, said the south cared little for the problems of the north. ''It's an example of 'I'm all right, Jack,' '' he said. ''I'm all right down here. I don't feel it.'' **********Other unemployed men gathered at the center said they had heard that under the Thatcher Government, the average national wage had risen to about $250 a week, but most of the jobs posted at the Job Center paid less than half that. **********John Watson is in charge of a Government program to study crime in Bolton, which has been increasing. Much of it, he said, is a result of unemployment, especially among young people. The practice of smashing and emptying the coin-operated meters found on some home heating systems is increasingly common, as are muggings. Life Without Superficiality **********Twenty-five years ago, David Buxton, a business consultant, came here from the London area to try to make a living. One of the things that put him off in the south, he said, was that ''I'd go for a walk and someone would be working in the garden and I used to say hello and they usually fell over.'' **********He continued, ''Up here if you don't say hello you'd be unusual.'' **********Mr. Buxton, now head of the Chamber of Commerce, added: ''A lot of people in the south think people up here are rough and uncultured. Well, there are some very cultured people, with lovely houses, artistic interests. The appreciation of life is richer, divested of superficiality. No veneer. People in the south feel they have to put on a face, to say things in a roundabout way. Up here, it's just straight.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/09/business/mounting-conflict-over-trade-looms-for-us-and-japan.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1987-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1208, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOUNTING CONFLICT OVER TRADE LOOMS FOR U.S. AND JAPAN", "print_headline": "MOUNTING CONFLICT OVER TRADE LOOMS FOR U.S. AND JAPAN", "body_text": " **********The United States and Japan are headed for their most serious trade confrontation of the postwar period, Government officials and many private analysts believe. **********Frustrations have stiffened attitudes on both sides of the Pacific, making compromises less likely on a whole range of issues from semiconductors and supercomputers to the letting of contracts for an $8.5 billion airport construction project at Osaka. **********''This may be the year in which the string runs out on Capitol Hill,'' warned the United States trade representative, Clayton K. Yeutter. ''The level of frustration with Japan is higher than I have ever seen it.'' Outlook for Approval **********Although President Reagan would probably veto legislation forcing trade retaliation against Japan, Mr. Yeutter warned in an interview that a veto could become ''irrelevant'' should such legislation clear overwhelmingly, as is now indicated. **********Resentment is being fed by the widening trade imbalance. Last year's deficit in trade with Japan was $58 billion, about one-third of the overall United States trade deficit of $170 billion. Some analysts believe it could get even bigger this year. **********''Japan is not going to get a sympathetic audience from anybody in the U.S. or from anybody in the world,'' said Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. **********And Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, said: ''There is a hardening inside the Congress. The point has been reached where people want us to take strong action. I think the Japanese are laughing behind their hands wondering why we didn't do anything a lot earlier.'' **********But Japanese resistance to American trade demands is also strengthening - mainly because the dramatic shift in the yen-dollar relationship has hurt export industries and has brought a new phenomenon to Japan: rising unemployment. **********Last week Japan reported that unemployment rose in January to 3 percent, the highest level since monthly reporting began in 1953. Japan's Growing Anxiety **********Although this is less than half the American jobless rate, the Japanese figure, which means nearly 2 million workers are unemployed, has caused a deepening anxiety that is reflected in less resilient Japanese positions at the trade bargaining table. **********One of the big worries is that Japanese corporations' expansion in the United States and elsewhere overseas is leading to a ''hollowing out'' of the industrial base in Japan. A recent Tokyo report predicts that domestic employment opportunities will shrink by 600,000 jobs by the year 2000, leading to an acute unemployment crisis. **********S. Bruce Smart Jr., Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade administration, who recently returned from negotiations in Tokyo on semiconductors and supercomputers, said he found the Japanese positions were ''clearly a lot tougher than ever before.'' **********He said, ''We should be careful to recognize that the Japanese are under some internal pressure, but we must continue being just as aggressive and forceful as we have ever been.'' Most-Urgent Trade Issues **********The most-pressing trade conflicts are these: *********** Semiconductors: Japan agreed last July to open its market to sales of American computer chips. The target was $2 billion of additional exports in five years. The Japanese also agreed to help assure that Japanese companies would quit dumping chips in the United States and third-country markets at less than fair value. ''Clearly we are very disturbed that Japan has not fulfilled its obligations under that agreement,'' said Mr. Yeutter. Washington could retaliate if the Japanese do not come into better compliance by the end of this month. *********** Kansai Airport: The Japanese are building an island in Osaka Bay as the site of a huge airport to serve the Osaka region. But American and other foreign companies are effectively barred from any of the major construction work. The United States may react by barring Japanese companies from bidding on airport construction projects in this country. Legislation to do this has been introduced by Senator Frank H. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican. *********** Supercomputers: The Reagan Administration has begun a formal investigation of Japanese barriers to imports of these huge and unusually fast computers, which cost up to $20 million each. Despite its acknowledged technological lead over Japan, the United States has only 23 percent of the Japanese supercomputer market, compared with 86 percent in the rest of the world. The investigation could lead to a formal trade complaint and eventual retaliation. *********** Auto parts: This country's annual deficit in auto parts trade with Japan has grown to roughly $7 billion a year. Although an agreement was reached in 1980, the Japanese have bought only $200 million of American parts. The agreement called for purchases of $300 million in 1981 alone. Now the United States is again pressing the Japanese for greater access, this time within the framework of what have become known as the Market-Oriented Sector Selective talks. So far the Japanese have promised only to provide information - a breakdown of the broad categories of Japanese purchases of auto parts from American companies. Competitive Edge Sought **********Trade tensions with Japan are rising despite the acknowledgement by many people in the United States that the loss of American competitiveness is at least as important an element in the trade imbalance as unfair trade practices by Japan or any other country. Some analysts here see Japan as an all-too-easy scapegoat for American shortcomings. **********''Japan is the metaphor for the loss of our competitive edge,'' commented Steven R. Saunders, a former assistant United States trade representative and now a trade consultant with some Japanese clients. ''We don't understand that our demands are perceived, from the Japanese point of view, as a kind of extortion.'' **********The Japanese Embassy's economic counselor, Yoshidji Nogami, noted a ''growing feeling in Japan that the trade problems between the two countries are rooted in the U.S. situation.'' **********Against the mounting acrimony, some analysts still see a turn for the better in the trade situation, and they fear that excessive American pressure would be counterproductive. Prediction of Improvement **********''I believe we are going to see a trade improvement in the coming months,'' said Robert Z. Lawrence, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''It is clear that the Japanese are beginning to be hammered in third-country markets in terms of price competitiveness.'' **********He cited comparisons of Japanese and American export prices compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showing that Japanese prices are now 5 percent higher than American prices. In March 1985 they were 20 percent lower. **********''Japan bashing will not help in this environment,'' said George R. Packard, dean of the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University and director of the Edwin O. Reischauer Center for East Asian Studies. ''It will cause more resentment, make it more difficult to get concessions and trouble the waters for Nakasone.'' **********Japanese officials report that Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is tentatively planning a visit to Washington in April to see President Reagan and make a fresh effort to ease the trade tensions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/11/world/olive-grove-brings-arabs-and-jews-together.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1987-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 532, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OLIVE GROVE BRINGS ARABS AND JEWS TOGETHER", "print_headline": "OLIVE GROVE BRINGS ARABS AND JEWS TOGETHER", "body_text": " **********A simple grove of olive trees brought Arabs and Jews together today to protest the Israeli Government's plan to uproot trees long tended by the Arabs. **********Against the backdrop of a rusted barbed-wire fence surrounding a minefield from the 1967 war, hundreds of people from the two groups gathered at the olive groves here in the Jerusalem suburbs and shook hands. It was the first time they had reached out to one another in such a heartfelt fashion in the memory of members of the two crowds that quickly, easily became one on the breezy hillside. **********''I want to see you in my house,'' Nahum Megged, a professor from Hebrew University, told Hassan Abu Assala, an Arab municipal worker.

Mr. Megged asked. **********Colleagues in the crowd said it was a matter of the politics of territoriality. After taking over the territory from Jordan after the 1967 war, Israel expropriated more than 500 acres of the Arabs' land, including other olive groves, for public purposes. **********''Where can we go? Show us the place we can go!'' an Arab resident said over the loudspeaker whose sound drifted down toward the olive trees. A Rare Sight **********''I've never seen anything quite like this,'' said Yehuda Litani, Middle East news editor of The Jerusalem Post, as he watched the crowds mix, smile and exchange greetings. He said such an unusual mingling might happen occasionally in a rural area, but never here in the Jerusalem metropolis. **********''I'm here as a resident,'' he said, applauding the good will and beaming when the Mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, arrived to support the protest. ''Neighbors are working together, standing together in what seems to be a matter of justice,'' the mayor said. ''I hope that we will succeed.''

Pickering, the United States Ambassador to Israel, was described as expressing the personal sentiments of President Reagan. It was sent after Israeli officials expressed annoyance that the disclosures in Washington emphasized Israel's role in helping to persuade the Reagan Administration to sell arms to Iran. No Prior Notification **********On Thursday, after reports about the Senate Intelligence Committee's draft report on the Iran affair began to circulate, the White House began releasing excerpts from two declassified documents that underscored Israel's behind-the-scenes maneuvers in the Iran operation. On Friday the White House made public the texts of the two papers. **********According to State Department officials, White House officials, in their rush to make the documents public, had failed to follow the normal diplomatic courtesy of informing a friendly government ahead of time that it might be embarrassed by the disclosures. Paper Prepared by North **********One of the two documents was a ''finding'' by Mr. Reagan on Jan. 17, 1986, authorizing the arms sales to Iran. **********That document did not mention Israel. **********However, Israel was highlighted in the second document, a memorandum for Mr. Reagan that accompanied the finding and summarized the reasons for adopting it. The memo was prepared by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the former National Security Council aide who was a central figure in the secret Iran operation. **********The three-page memo began by saying that ''Prime Minister Peres of Israel secretly dispatched his special adviser on terrorism with instructions to propose a plan by which Israel, with limited assistance from the U.S., can create conditions to help bring about a more moderate government in Iran.'' **********Shimon Peres, who is now Foreign Minister, turned over the job of Prime Minister to Mr. Shamir last October. **********The memo also said that Israel and Iran had agreed ''that the hostages will be immediately released'' after the first 1,000 of 4,000 TOW antitank missiles were shipped. **********The release of the White House documents coincided with the formal announcement on Friday that Mr. Shamir would be making an official visit to Mr. Reagan on Feb. 18. **********In addition, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is expected in Washington a week after Mr. Shamir, White House officials said. **********The disclosures may also have a bearing on the Middle East tour of Richard W. Murphy, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, who is trying to revive the dormant Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. Mr. Murphy has held talks in Israel, Jordan, and Egypt and is now in Saudi Arabia. **********''It couldn't have been worse timed,'' a State Department official said of the release of the documents. Rumors of 'a New Camp David' **********There have been persistent rumors in the Middle East that the Administration was trying to promote ''a new Camp David'' by having Mr. Shamir and Mr. Mubarak meet with King Hussein of Jordan and Mr. Reagan. But White House officials said there was no plan to bring the leaders together in Washington. **********Reports on the Senate committee document and on the two White House documents have been featured in the Israeli press. The theme in Israel, as in the United States, was that Israel initiated the Iran operation and continuously sought to persuade the Reagan Administration to sell arms to Iran. **********That suggestion clashed with the repeated Israeli contention that the United States had asked Israel for help in freeing the hostages in Lebanon and that Israel had not initiated the Iran operation. **********Mr. Shamir, in a statement on Sunday before he met with Ambassador Pickering, said of the reports about the Senate committee document that ''everything attributed to Israel has no basis in reality.'' 'Not an Attempt to Point Fingers' **********Today, a high State Department official said that once the White House documents were made public, the Administration realized the potential for damage in relations with Israel. **********''Tom Pickering was told to tell Shamir that the White House release of the documents was not an attempt to point fingers and accuse Israel of anything, but that so much partial and incorrect information had been leaked out, and the President had a commitment to get everything out to the public, that the White House felt it was important to get them on the record,'' he said. **********Nevertheless, several State Department officials have privately expressed sharp criticism of the Israeli Government for its efforts to convince the United States that the Iranian intermediary, the arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar, could be trusted. **********Americans involved in the operation have said the Israelis told American officials that Mr. Ghorbanifar had assured them that in return for arms, all the American hostages would be freed. Disinformation Campaign Denied **********''The Israelis had their own agenda with Iran, and they drew us into it,'' a State Department official said. ''Whether they were tricked by the Iranians is for them to answer.'' **********Despite the fact that all the hostages were not freed, the United States continued to provide arms to Iran in the hope that they would all be eventually released, officials have said. **********In another matter, Secretary of State George P. Shultz denied today that the Administration had provided misleading or incomplete intelligence information to Iraq. **********An article in The New York Times today said American intelligence agencies had provided both Iran and Iraq with deliberately distorted or inaccurate intelligence information. **********Speaking to reporters on his plane on route from Lagos, Nigeria, to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Mr. Shultz said, ''So far as I know any intelligence we've given to Iraq has been dead on the mark.'' **********He said he had ''no information about any intelligence exchange with Iran.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/19/business/what-s-new-in-foreign-language-television-tuning-in-to-a-persian-johnny-carson.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Barthold", "pub_date": "1987-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 448, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TUNING IN TO A 'PERSIAN JOHNNY CARSON'", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE TELEVISION; TUNING IN TO A 'PERSIAN JOHNNY CARSON'", "body_text": " **********IRANIANS in Southern California rarely stay up to watch Johnny Carson these days.

Aviem Sella or with the Tel Nof Air Base, which he commands. **********Colonel Sella has been indicted by a Federal grand jury on charges of espionage in the case of Jonathan Jay Pollard, a United States Navy employee who has been sentenced to life in prison for giving intelligence information to Israel. **********There has been considerable anger in Washington over the subsequent promotion of Colonel Sella to commander of one of Israel's major bases, and over the promotion of Rafi Eitan, a former Israeli adviser on terrorism who reportedly ran the spy operation, to head Israel's state-owned chemical industry. These promotions came after the Israeli authorities insisted that the spy affair was a ''rogue operation,'' not authorized by high officials. Promotion in Rank Delayed **********According to a State Department official, the Israelis were also planning to promote Colonel Sella in rank, to brigadier general, but delayed that after protests by the United States Embassy in Tel Aviv. **********The annoyance with Israel has been compounded by the Justice Department's reported discovery that Mr. Eitan and two other Israelis lied after they were given immunity from prosecution on the assurance that they would provide complete, truthful accounts of the spy operation. Because the Justice Department believes they did not do so, officials said, it has asked the court to withdraw their immunity and plans to seek indictments against them. **********Despite these problems, Mr. Shultz urged a continuation of the strong Israeli-American relationship.

Boone Pickens today abandoned his third attempt to acquire the Diamond Shamrock Corporation, leaving analysts uncertain about whether he intends to attempt yet another bid or will turn his sights on a different energy company. **********The decision by Lucky Partners, an investor group headed by Mr. Pickens, came hours after Shamrock's directors voted Sunday night to formally reject its offer to buy all of Shamrock's shares for $15 a share, or $2.06 billion. Pickens Assails 'Connivance' **********Mr. Pickens accused Shamrock's board of having ''barricaded itself within a fortress of anti-takeover defenses.'' He also criticized the Prudential Insurance Company of America for ''connivance'' with Shamrock in preventing shareholders from voting on his offer. **********Prudential was given veto power over any takeover offer when it invested $300 million in Shamrock on Feb. 2. A Shamrock spokesman said the company had no comment on Mr. Pickens's attack. **********A Prudential spokesman, Joseph Vecchione, said, ''Our willingness to make the investment and the nature of the investment speak for themselves.'' **********Shamrock today proceeded with its plan to purchase 20 million of its shares for $17 each, and to split into two independent companies within 90 days. Shamrock directors initially valued the plan at about $17 a share. **********The company said Sunday that rising oil prices would make its two separate businesses - one in refining and marketing and the other in exploration and production - more attractive to investors when they become independent. Profit Expectations Rise **********Many analysts agreed, adding that Roger R. Hemminghaus and Charles L. Blackburn, the executives who will head the new companies, had raised Wall Street's profit expectations for the companies at a crowded breakfast meeting in New York on Friday. **********William H. Bricker, who yielded the chief executive post to Mr. Blackburn Feb. 2 and intends to step down as chairman after the companies are broken up, did not attend the meeting. **********Analysts said that with Mr. Blackburn, a former executive of the Shell Oil Corporation, running the energy and production unit, its stock should trade for more than $12 a share after the refining and marketing unit is shed. Institutional Investors Sell **********Yet the pullout by Mr. Pickens evidently dampened investors' enthusiasm. Shamrock shares lost 37.5 cents, closing at $14.50 today. The stock was the most heavily traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2.4 million shares exchanged. Professional traders said many institutional investors were selling their stock rather than participate in Shamrock's restructuring. **********Shares of the Mesa Limited Partnership, which controls 85 percent of Lucky Partners, were unchanged today at $16.75. **********In its statement, Mesa said it had officially ended its January offer to buy 20 million Shamrock shares for $15 each, in cash. The offer was to expire Wednesday. **********It termed its Feb. 4 cash bid to buy all of the company for $15 a share a ''proposal.'' David H. Batchelder, a Mesa official, said in a telephone interview from Mesa's headquarters in Amarillo, Tex., that the board's refusal to hold a shareholder vote meant the proposal was dead. **********He declined to comment on Lucky Partners' next move. The group owns 5 million Shamrock shares it bought late last year at an average price of $13 a share. Shamrock has 109.8 million common shares outstanding. Rumors About Enserch **********The group has several options, including a court challenge of Shamrock's position or the sale of its Shamrock stake at a modest profit in the open market. Mr. Batchelder put the group's average total cost, including expenses from three takeover bids, at $14 a share. **********Some analysts said they were checking rumors that Mr. Pickens had abandoned his quest for Shamrock in favor of a new target, the Enserch Corporation.

Mr. Turner works in this port city at the southeast tip of the Soviet Union, 55 miles from Vladivostok, as the American manager of the Marine Resources Company, a joint Soviet-American fishing venture founded 10 years ago. **********The nearest American presence in the Soviet Union is in Moscow, 4,500 miles to the west. Japan rests tantalizingly nearby, but can be reached only by a 52-hour ferry ride or by plane from the Soviet city of Khabarovsk, a 16-hour train ride from Nakhodka. **********Nakhodka seems to treat its resident American with an ambivalence familiar to foreigners who work in Moscow. **********''I have no problem with official relationships,'' Mr. Turner said on a recent afternoon as he showed an American reporter around town. ''In fact I get along well with the authorities, but when it comes to socializing, I'm a leper.'' **********Before moving here, Mr. Turner, who is 33 years old, worked for five years as a marine resources representative aboard Soviet fish-processing ships in the North Pacific. **********He said the duty, which included four- to six-month spells of working with Soviet crews aboard ships with minimal comforts, hardened him for the current assignment but did not fully prepare him for the isolation that comes with being a foreigner on Russian soil, particularly in a provincial city. **********''I got to know many of the sailors, some quite well,'' he recalled. ''We spent hours aboard ship talking, often in intense discussions. But when I run into some of those same men in Nakhodka, it's clear they no longer feel they can be my friend.'' **********One of Mr. Turner's predecessors -he is the sixth American assigned to the Nakhodka office - tried to break the social ice by playing on the local basketball team. There was only one problem: Although one of the starting players, the American was not allowed to accompany the team when they played in other cities, all closed to foreigners. **********Mr. Turner stays in touch with the outside world by the company phone and telex, which he must use sparingly because of the cost, and by mail, which takes two to four weeks to reach him. **********Marine Resources, established by a Seattle businessman, James Talbot, has weathered the ups and downs of Soviet-American relations in the last decade. **********The company is a 50-50 partnership, unlike new joint ventures being encouraged by Moscow, in which the Soviet side retains 51 percent control. **********The business brings together American fishermen along the Pacific coast of Canada and the United States with Soviet processing and storage vessels. **********The catch, which totaled more than 300,000 metric tons last year, is distributed in the Soviet Union and exported to foreign markets, including the United States and Japan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/10/business/investing-too-many-choices-one-fund-buys-all.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallce", "pub_date": "1987-05-10", "snippet": "LEAD: CONSUMERS in an affluent society face an abundance of choices, sometimes too many.", "word_count": 909, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTING;\nTOO MANY CHOICES?

That has spelled opportunity for investment organizations. In the past two years, a number of firms have revived the 1960's fund-of-funds approach, in which a money manager invests in a variety of mutual funds, rather than directly in stocks or bonds. **********In addition to mutual funds, some trust account managers and private partnerships have adopted this approach. A no-load mutual fund wooing the small investor might require a minimum investment as low as $250, while a private partnership with a wealthy clientele might seek a minimum of $1 million or more. **********Investors pay a price to have a mutual fund to pick other funds for them. Many of these funds tend to produce below-average investment results. And some funds have layers of management fees, which make them more expensive than direct investments in mutual funds. **********The Vanguard Group was one of the first organizations to revive the fund-of-funds concept when it offered its STAR Fund, which invests in shares of Vanguard's other mutual funds, in 1985. Vanguard said its customers had become confused trying to choose from more than 40 mutual funds. ''We wanted to simplify the choice,'' said Jeremy G. Duffield, senior vice president. **********Similarly, executives at T. Rowe Price Associates decided to start two such funds after the number of their mutual funds increased to 24, up from 10 in 1982. The two new funds, which are still in registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission, will invest in shares of Price's growth-stock funds and income-oriented funds. **********Individual investors who don't want to be restricted to the mutual funds offered by one organization have other choices. Scudder Fund Distributors recently began offering investors the Rodney Square Multi-Manager Fund. The Rodney Square Management Corporation of Wilmington, Del., manages the fund, which includes three separate stock portfolios managed, in turn, by nine investment management firms. **********In addition, the FundTrust series, distributed by Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney Inc., offers funds that invest in income funds, growth-stock funds, aggressive growth funds, and growth and income funds. The Republic National Bank of New York, the investment adviser, invests each fund in shares of 10 to 12 other mutual funds. **********Too much diversification can be a bad thing. The more diversified a fund is, the closer it comes to matching the average performance of all stocks. After management fees and stock trading commissions are subtracted, the performance can easily slip below the average. ''By definition, they are overly diversified,'' said Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. **********The performance of Vanguard's STAR Fund, for instance, has been ''reasonable but not stellar,'' Mr. Duffield acknowledges. ''We are not promising spectacular performance, just good steady performance over the long term.'' **********The Vanguard STAR fund advanced 14.75 percent during the 12 months ended April 30, according to Lipper. In comparison, the average balanced mutual fund gained 15.66 percent in the same period and the stock market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, was up 22.62 percent. Similarly, the FundTrust funds also underperformed their respective sectors. **********Still, Michael Hirsch, senior vice president of Republic, argues that these funds will fare better in a down market or over long market cycles. **********Then, there is the thorny issue of management fees. While Vanguard and T. Rowe Price do not charge an additional fee on top of the underlying mutual funds fees, some others do. FundTrust, for example, has an expense ratio of about 1.7 percent, almost twice the amount an investor would pay using some stock mutual funds. And customers of banks that use mutual funds, such as those offered by Evaluation Associates, a consulting firm in Westport, Conn., might pay fees of as much as 1.5 percent of their account, almost three times what some trust customers pay. **********The fund-of-funds approach is being promoted to big investors, too. There has been a proliferation of private partnerships that invest in stocks, bonds, options, futures and other financial instruments, such as those managed by Cumberland Partners and New York investors George Soros, John Oppenheim, Martin Perelman and Julian Robertson. **********Typically, these aggressively managed partnerships, or ''hedge funds,'' have been available only to wealthy individuals. Their excellent results - compound annual returns of twice the S.& P. 500, according to a study of 75 partnerships by Tremont Partners - have made them attractive investments for a number of new investors. But the hedge funds usually charge a fee that can be as high as 20 percent of the profits. **********Firms such as Tremont in Stamford, Conn., and Stolper & Company in San Diego are setting up partnerships that invest in seven to ten other partnerships. Minimum investments range from $250,000 to $1 million. For a fee, Tremont and Stolper select the hedge funds, monitor their performance and provide the portfolio accounting for investors. Stolper's president, Michael Stolper, estimated that as many as 25 of these partnerships of partnerships might be in formation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/16/business/no-headline-900987.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1987-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1046, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********Hard experience has taught the nation's bankers to be skeptical of Congress. Still bitter about the moratorium on expanded banking businesses that was imposed by Congress last summer, they have started a new lobbying campaign to defend their industry's interests on Capitol Hill. **********As the leading banking groups seek to drum up grass-roots support from their members across the country, they have turned to slogans such as ''Kill the moratorium; let banks compete'' and ''Keep the promise'' - a reference to a Congressional promise that the industry would be allowed to resume seeking expanded powers in such profitable businesses as securities underwriting, real estate and insurance, after the moratorium expires March 1, 1988. **********Until last summer, bankers had found comforting allies in the large regulatory agencies - the Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - that had slowly expanded their freedom to enter new businesses. But the moratorium, embodied in the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987, abruptly stopped that process. Aftermath of Stock Plunge **********Many members of Congress have promised that they would oppose any extension of the moratorium, but others have hinted recently that, under certain circumstances, an extension might be necessary. **********In the face of such uncertainty, the bankers are not taking any chances, especially in the aftermath of the stock market's collapse last month. They fear that market dislocation may persuade a jittery Congress to play it safe, especially in a Presidential election year, and indefinitely extend the moratorium while avoiding some politically hard decisions. **********The moratorium hits at the heart of the banking system's hope for future profitability. In recent years bankers have seen their primary markets of consumer deposits, consumer loans and top-quality commercial loans invaded by less-regulated institutions such as mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage firms. **********While the moratorium was primarily aimed at removing the regulatory agencies from the process of setting new banking policy, it was seen as a major political defeat for bankers, illustrating their lack of influence in comparison with other lobbies. Bankers See Discrimination **********''Bankers take the moratorium very personally because they see it as discriminating against them,'' said Ed Yingling, head of government relations at the American Bankers Association. ''We had a summit meeting recently involving all the major bank trade groups, and all agreed to join this fight to stop any extension of the moratorium.'' **********March 1 is still more than 100 days away, as an A.B.A. newsletter titled Countdown points out. Still, the bankers feel they have good reason to be concerned, based on past experience and current rumblings in Congress. **********In the mid-1960's, for example, Congress imposed a ''temporary'' interest-rate differential that let the thrift industry pay consumers one-quarter percentage point more on passbook savings accounts than banks paid. That regulation was extended many times and was not removed until 17 years later. **********Some prominent members of Congress are sending signals that they do not intend to be forced to abandon the moratorium next year simply because last summer's legislation stipulated that it should not continue beyond March 1. Approach to Restructuring **********''The decision to restructure'' the banking industry ''should not be dictated by the artificial time frame established by the moratorium,'' said Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. **********He said that any serious thinking about changing the structure of the banking system ''must take into account what happened to the equity markets in October.'' **********He added, ''If Congress needs more time to evaluate these issues, it must consider extending the moratorium.'' **********Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, is another lawmaker who has put the bankers on notice that he may not support an automatic end to the moratorium. **********Although the Senate is seeking to produce legislation that would open new businesses for commercial banks, Mr. Wirth said, that process may not be completed by March 1. Lifting the moratorium might unleash deregulatory forces that could prove difficult for Congress to reverse, he added. A Similar Possibility Hinted **********Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, has outlined a similar scenario. He sees a possibility that Congress might want to impose a temporary extension of the moratorium to give it time to finish legislation that would restructure the entire industry. But Senator Dodd has said he hopes the moratorium will not be extended. **********Bankers regard even these modest rumblings as potential disasters. **********After having failed to secure important deregulation moves from Congress for years, the banking industry had found that the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller and the F.D.I.C. were willing to move for regulatory changes. **********Major banks such as Citicorp, Chase and Bankers Trust received approval from the Fed to begin dabbling in new underwriting businesses such as commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities and industrial revenue bonds. The Fed is also seeking comment on a proposal to let bank holding companies engage in certain new real estate activities. Legal Challenges Expected **********But the moratorium and a lawsuit filed by the securities industry have stopped that deregulatory movement in its tracks - at least until next March 1. And even if the moratorium expires, Mr. Yingling concedes, it could be years before legal challenges to the new banking powers are decided in the courts. **********''It's inevitable that all these cases are going to go to the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Yingling said. **********Moreover, while the banking industry has found Wall Street lobbyists to be formidable opponents, it faces even stronger foes when it considers trying to secure authority to offer real estate and insurance services. **********''I think it's likely that the moratorium on getting into securities may be allowed to expire, while the moratoria against real estate and insurance may be kept on,'' said Steven Verdier, chief lobbyist for the Independent Bankers Association."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/07/world/china-sentences-editor-as-a-critic-of-socialism.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 249, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Sentences Editor As a Critic of Socialism", "print_headline": "China Sentences Editor As a Critic of Socialism", "body_text": " **********The editor of a literary magazine has been sentenced to seven years in prison for defaming China's socialist system, the daily China Legal News reported today.

''The continuing dismemberment of this institution no longer justifies our current offered price,'' Joseph J. Pinola, the chairman and chief executive of First Interstate, said in a statement. **********But BankAmerica could face renewed takeover efforts if its situation does not improve, though it seems the immediate threat is over. First Interstate said in its statement that it would ''continue to monitor closely'' the activities of BankAmerica. **********New York's Citicorp has expressed some interest in buying all or part of BankAmerica but would likely require special legislation to avoid prohibitions on interstate banking. However, Willie Brown, the Speaker of the California Assembly, who had proposed such legislation, which would have allowed Citicorp to bid against First Interstate, said today that his bill was no longer necessary. **********Despite today's development, BankAmerica's problems are not over. The troubled bank lost $518 million in 1986 and faces at least two more quarters of operating losses, in the opinion of most analysts. **********BankAmerica, the nation's second-largest banking company after Citicorp, still has $5 billion of problem loans. **********Moreover, BankAmerica is a far different organization than it was when First Interstate made its bid in October - stronger and trimmer in some ways, but without some of its most profitable assets. It remains to be seen whether BankAmerica has mortgaged its future by selling off such profitable assets as its Charles Schwab & Company discount brokerage and an Italian subsidiary for a short-term profit boost that was needed to stave off First Interstate. **********BankAmerica's chairman and chief executive, A. W. Clausen, said in a statement today that First Interstate's action ''is definitely in the interest of BankAmerica and all its shareholders.'' **********''We will now be able to focus all our attention on the job of turning BankAmerica around in 1987,'' he added. Mr. Clausen defended the bank's restructuring, saying the program would have been undertaken ''whether or not there had been a merger proposal.'' **********First Interstate officials were not immediately available for interviews. In the past, some officials have indicated that the bank holding company, which already owns banks in numerous Western states, would seek to acquire a bank in Texas. **********Analysts and banking industry executives have been saying that First Interstate's chances of success were growing dimmer because of BankAmerica's restructuring. The final blows apparently were the sale of the Schwab brokerage last week to a group headed by Mr. Schwab, and the coming offering of up to $1 billion in securities announced by BankAmerica. **********These actions, in addition to lowering the worth of the company to First Interstate, helped strengthen the capital of BankAmerica, presumably alleviating some of the concerns of Federal regulators who would have had to approve such a merger. Still, First Interstate's Mr. Pinola, a former BankAmerica executive who has been pursuing the merger with a singular zeal, was not expected to give up easily. But the retreat is a personal victory for Mr. Clausen over Mr. Pinola, his former employee. **********First Interstate, which is based in Los Angeles, has been pursuing BankAmerica since 1985 and made a formal bid last October. The takeover, which would have been for more than $3 billion in securities, would have created a huge multistate bank almost equal in size to Citicorp. Offer Forced Departure **********The bid was the final straw that forced the ouster of BankAmerica's chief executive, Samuel H. Armacost, and the return of the former chief, Mr. Clausen. Mr. Clausen and the board at first tried to put off First Interstate by asking it to withdraw, all the while beginning the restructuring program designed in part to make a takeover unfeasible. **********First Interstate declined to withdraw and eventually filed required documents with the Federal Reserve Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission to bypass BankAmerica's directors and go directly to shareholders with an exchange offer. **********The battle became increasingly nasty, with employees and politicians becoming involved. At one point BankAmerica officials accused Mr. Pinola of ''reckless'' behavior and said that securities he offered in exchange for BankAmerica's common stock were a joke. Even today both sides fired parting shots, issuing biting statements aimed at the other side. **********First Interstate's retreat was also seen as a victory for San Francisco, which is worried that it is falling behind Los Angeles as a business center and did not want to see its largest bank taken over. ''I'm very pleased and delighted to hear it,'' San Francisco's Mayor, Dianne Feinstein, said today. ''I think it's a bellwether signal in the recovery of the bank.'' Shareholder Gains Seen **********First Interstate had argued that the acquisition, for securities it valued at over $20 a share, would have been a good one for BankAmerica's shareholders, whose stock had been selling at $12 before the offer was made and whose dividends had been eliminated. First Interstate contended that, in addition to restoring dividends, merger-related accounting practices and economies of scale would have allowed it to strengthen BankAmerica far more quickly than BankAmerica could improve on its own. **********The announcement of the withdrawal came after the close of trading today. BankAmerica shares closed unchanged at $13.875; First Interstate finished off 50 cents at $56. **********BankAmerica had argued that the securities offered by First Interstate were worth far less than $20 and that the combined bank would be under-capitalized. Moreover, BankAmerica had said that First Interstate was planning to use BankAmerica's own assets to finance the takeover and that First Interstate shareholders would have shared the benefits of a turnaround at BankAmerica that rightfully belonged only to BankAmerica shareholders. **********First Interstate had not yet received permission from the S.E.C. or Federal Reserve for its hostile tender offer and both agencies had asked for refinements to First Interstate's application. **********However, to gain Fed approval, First Interstate might have had to offer more of its common stock, instead of preferred shares or debentures, which could have made it more difficult for it to pay. However, First Interstate said today that it believed it would have received approval had it continued to press its offer. **********In any case, the need to refile its Fed application and answer the S.E.C.'s questions made this a natural time for First Interstate to re-evaluate whether to keep going or pull back."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/19/world/new-head-is-named-for-beirut-school.html": {"writer_name": "Marvine Howe", "pub_date": "1987-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 603, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW HEAD IS NAMED FOR BEIRUT SCHOOL", "print_headline": "NEW HEAD IS NAMED FOR BEIRUT SCHOOL", "body_text": " **********The new president of the American University of Beirut, Dr. Frederic P.

The lawyer, Paul H. Wein, was accused of misrepresenting the value of marital property. **********Still, not all courts that have considered the issue are willing to extend liability. Judge Frank Easterbrook of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, upheld a lower court ruling last year that dismissed a lawsuit brought against both a law firm and an accounting firm. **********The lawyers and accountants were sued by purchasers of bonds issued by the Michigan Baptist Foundation Inc. The bonds, which had not been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, eventually went sour. **********In dismissing the suit, Judge Easterbrook said the lawyers had no duty to the purchasers and were not ''required to tattle on their clients in the absence of some duty to disclose.'' He also noted that even if the firm had committed malpractice, it had no special duty to warn the buyers about the bonds. **********That view is similar to the rule on legal malpractice adopted by courts through most of this century. Historically, in order to sue for malpractice, a person had to be ''in privity'' - that is, in some sort of contractual relationship - with the lawyer. **********Until recently, courts and scholars, taking the position that privity was routinely required, quoted the view of a leading barrister of his day, Lord Henry Brougham. While defending Queen Caroline in 1820 against charges of adultery, he said, ''An advocate, in the discharge of his duty, knows but one person in all the world, and that person is his client.'' **********But times have changed, according to Professor Gillers. ''No matter how nostalgic it makes lawyers, no matter what deep patriotic emotions it stirs up for the profession, it is simply no longer true,'' he said. ''Lord Brougham would not be able to get malpractice insurance today. He would probably be bankrupt. Lawyers must now know many clients.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/17/world/austrians-seem-to-cut-support-for-waldheim.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1312, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AUSTRIANS SEEM TO CUT SUPPORT FOR WALDHEIM", "print_headline": "AUSTRIANS SEEM TO CUT SUPPORT FOR WALDHEIM", "body_text": " **********Chancellor Franz Vranitzky will make a symbolically important visit to Washington this week amid signs that political support for President Kurt Waldheim has eroded in Austria since the Justice Department listed Mr. Waldheim as being barred from entering the United States. **********The Justice Department's action on April 27, which effectively bans Mr. Waldheim from traveling to the United States because of his presumed implication in Nazi war crimes in the Balkans, has had a powerful effect in Austria. Politicians and journalists say Mr. Waldheim's spreading unpopularity threatens to undermine the functioning of the country's new coalition Government. 'Nobody Likes a Loser' **********A senior Vienna editor, whose newspaper originally backed Mr. Waldheim, summed up a mood developing in Austrian political circles. ''It's sliding toward how to get rid of him,'' the editor said. ''Nobody likes a loser, and Waldheim is looking like a loser.'' **********Unrest is growing in Chancellor Vranitzky's Socialist Party, which opposed Mr. Waldheim when he ran as the candidate of the People's Party a year ago but which was obliged to muffle its criticism of him after the two big parties formed a coalition in March. **********In a parliamentary debate on the affair last week, Socialist deputies conspicuously avoided applauding the People's Party leader and Deputy Chancellor, Alois Mock, who characterized the Justice Department decision as ''an unfriendly act'' made under the pressure of ''selfish and intransigent interest groups'' in the United States. A Question of Priorities **********Socialist deputies initially balked at a motion that backed the Government's defense of President Waldheim against ''unjustified accusations,'' and one backbencher, Josef Czap, said that sooner or later it would have to be decided whether Austria was more important than Mr. Waldheim. **********In an interview, Mr. Vranitzky went out of his way to distance himself from Mr. Waldheim. The Chancellor said there was sharpening criticism of the President's handling of the issue and shook his head emphatically when asked whether Mr. Waldheim had lived up to his pledge to be an activist head of state who would inspire a moral renewal in Austria. **********''I believe that he fulfills his functions,'' Mr. Vranitzky said, ''but beyond that, considering the unique situation he's in, he is extremely busy with the other matter.'' It was a delicate allusion to the international controversy that has engulfed and isolated Mr. Waldheim, 68 years old. **********Asked whether the President ought to resign to spare Austria further embarrassment, Mr. Vranitzky said, ''That Waldheim comes to this decision - you must ask him.'' **********In a society that lends great importance to titles, it was noteworthy that the Chancellor never once referred to Mr. Waldheim as ''President.'' An Expression of Dismay **********The Austrian Chancellor nonetheless expressed dismay at the American order banning Mr. Waldheim, saying he had hoped that foreign policy considerations and Austria's traditional pro-American orientation would have outweighed the Justice Department's deliberations and ''internal American aspects'' of the Waldheim case. **********When the Justice Department took its action against Mr. Waldheim, placing his name on a list of those to be excluded from entry, it cited evidence that he had ''participated in activities amounting to persecution'' of Jews and others in Greece and Yugoslavia during World War II, when Mr. Waldheim was a lieutenant in the German Army. **********Mr. Vranitzky, a 49-year-old former banker and basketball star, said he would be pleased if President Reagan would reconsider the decision when the two meet in Washington on Thursday, but he added that he did not think this was likely. The Chancellor is to arrive in New York on Tuesday evening for a three-day visit. Cordial Welcome Predicted **********The isolation and political eclipse of Mr. Waldheim, whose presidential post is largely ceremonial, has enhanced Chancellor Vranitzky's position as Austria's chief representative abroad. The American Ambassador to Austria, Ronald S. Lauder, predicted that Mr. Vranitzky would be cordially welcomed in Washington. **********''We want to show the Chancellor that this is directed against Kurt Waldheim and not against the Austrian people,'' Mr. Lauder said, referring to the decision to ban Mr. Waldheim from entering a country where he lived for decade when he was Secretary General of the United Nations. **********On Friday, a high-level Justice Department delegation, which included Neil Sher, the head of the section that argued for putting Mr. Waldheim on the list of those to be excluded from entry, explained the decision to Austrian officials. The Americans reportedly stressed that Mr. Waldheim was in ''a position to know'' about war crimes in the Balkans. **********But the American delegation brought no new historical documents that directly implicated the Austrian President in war crimes. According to a source close to the talks. this considerably irritated a senior Austrian official, Tomas Klestil, who nearly broke off the meeting in anger. **********As he seeks to clear his name, Mr. Waldheim has lodged a libel suit here against the president of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar M. Bronfman, who recently accused the Austrian President of having been ''part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine.'' **********But few politicians take the suit seriously, and Chancellor Vranitzky, when asked about it, dismissed the legal move with a shrug of the shoulders. 'The Ruin of My Life's Work' **********Even within the conservative People's Party, a vocal minority has started to argue in private that Mr. Waldheim has become an unbearable burden for this small neutral nation. And in the Socialist camp, Bruno Kreisky, the former Chancellor, caught a sentiment of exasperation by saying in a magazine interview that ''the Waldheim affair has robbed us of the international reputation that we have striven since 1945 to build.'' **********''I stand before the ruin of my life's work,'' said the former Socialist Chancellor, who advanced Mr. Waldheim's career. **********The parliamentary debate last week was widely described as a watershed in Austria's postwar political life, because for the first time a head of state, traditionally accorded a respect bordering on the reverence once given Hapsburg monarchs, was openly and quite personally criticized. **********A young deputy from the anti-establishment Green Party, Andreas Wabl, caused an uproar when he unfurled a swastika from the podium and declared that he was ashamed that Austria's President had served under that banner. Austrian television refused to show the Greens deputy's protest. **********More grave in political terms was a sarcastic attack on Mr. Waldheim by Jorg Haider, leader of the nationalistic Freedom Party, which had until recently been one of the President's stoutest defenders. Although bitterly lashing out at the United States, Mr. Haider poked fun at Mr. Waldheim's ''embarrassing failures of memory'' and his vacillation in summoning a historians' commission promised a year ago. **********A charismatic populist, Mr. Haider is seen as a politician with a finger on the nation's pulse. Some say his abandonment of Mr. Waldheim may be more significant than the impatience with the President in Austria's two biggest parties. **********Despite the quickening domestic controversy, politicians and journalists in Vienna said they did not expect Mr. Waldheim to resign soon, and several argued that it would be bad for him to buckle now under what could be portrayed as outside pressure. **********Paul Grosz, a representative of the small number of Jews in Austria, said at a news conference last week that he opposed a resignation by the President because it might foster anti-Semitism and ''a stab-in-the-back legend'' in Austria."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/02/business/gop-thwarts-tax-bill-plans.html": {"writer_name": "Gary Klott", "pub_date": "1987-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 899, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.O.P Thwarts Tax Bill Plans", "print_headline": "G.O.P Thwarts Tax Bill Plans", "body_text": " **********Efforts by the House Ways and Means Committee to begin drafting a tax bill today were scuttled after Republicans disputed the need to raise $12 billion from new taxes and refused to consider any specific revenue-raising proposals. **********Meeting with Democrats behind closed doors for nearly two hours, the Republicans raised the possibility that they might not participate in any future committee deliberations unless the $12 billion revenue goal were lowered and spending were cut more instead. **********Democrats, appearing surprised and frustrated by the Republicans' move, said that they would try to persuade Republicans to participate but that they were prepared to draft a tax bill alone if necessary. A Setback for Rostenkowski **********''To say I'm disappointed would minimize my dilemma,'' said Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. ''I'd like to have them participate. But the bill's got to be written.'' **********Under legislation signed by President Reagan over the weekend, if agreement cannot be reached on a way to reduce the Federal budget deficit by $23 billion, spending cuts of that amount would automatically take effect. **********Mr. Rostenkowski said the committee needed to complete work on the tax bill by Oct. 15 to keep to the budget timetable and avoid the automatic spending cuts. He said the committee would begin work on the tax bill on Wednesday - with or without the Republicans. **********As has become the norm for tax bills, hundreds of lobbyists gathered this morning in the cavernous House Ways and Means hearing room for the start of the committee's work. But neither the lobbyists nor the pool of television cameras got even a glimpse of the tax debate. As soon as the committee members assembled, they voted to move into closed session - as they have done increasingly in recent years in writing tax legislation. Resistance From Republicans **********According to the original plan, the committee was to have voted today on a list of 19 revenue-raising ideas prepared by the committee's staff. Democrats described the proposals as the ''easy ones'' because they were considered the least controversial. **********The list, raising a total of $8 billion, included many of the revenue proposals contained in President Reagan's 1988 budget recommendations, extensions of expiring excise taxes, and two previously introduced bills that were jointly sponsored by Mr. Rostenkowski and the committee's ranking Republican, Representative John J. Duncan of Tennessee. **********But Democratic and Republican members at the session said Republicans refused to talk about any specific proposals, including the President's revenue ideas. Instead, the nearly two-hour session focused on Republican complaints that Democratic leaders had set the overall revenue targets too high and the spending cuts too low. If they could not participate in setting the overall revenue numbers, then they did not want to participate in determining how to raise the money. **********''We were put in a budgetary straitjacket,'' Representative Bill Archer, a Texas Republican, said in an interview after the meeting. $8 Billion Goal Sought Representative Hal Daub, a Nebraska Republican, said that if the revenue target were reduced to $8 billion, many of the Republicans would be willing to participate. But Democrats gave no indication that they were about to bend. **********In a letter to Mr. Duncan, Mr. Rostenkowski expressed disappointment over today's Republican reaction, particularly because 12 of the 13 Republican members had voted last week for the automatic deficit reduction revision to the Gramm-Rudman law. **********''It is my hope that our deficit reduction efforts will continue in a bipartisan fashion,'' Mr. Rostenkowski wrote. He asked Mr. Duncan to meet with Republican members and ''to prepare a list of alternatives or additions to the proposals I put before the committee today. These can be either revenue proposals or additional spending cuts within the committee's jurisdiction.'' **********Over the years, Ways and Means Republicans have repeatedly complained about the minimal role they have played in the Democrat-controlled committee's deliberations. And the initiative for today's revolt appeared to be their own. Mr. Daub said the White House had no part in it. **********These were among the proposals in the committee's 23-page list of options: *********** Extending the Medicare payroll tax to all state and local government employees. *********** Requiring employers to pay Social Security tax on cash tips received by waiters and other employees. *********** Eliminating the Social Security tax exemption for certain student earnings. *********** Increasing the coal excise tax. *********** Imposing a $1-a-ticket excise tax for international travel. *********** Imposing user fees for ''private letter'' rulings from the Internal Revenue Service and for certain services provided by the Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. *********** Extending the 3 percent telephone excise tax, scheduled to expire at the end of this year. *********** Freezing the current estate and gift tax rates, instead of allowing them to drop next year as previously scheduled. **********The proposals stemming from the legislation previously introduced by Mr. Rostenkowski and Mr. Duncan included revising the corporate estimated tax rules and curtailing an estate tax loophole relating to sales of stock to employee stock ownership plans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/26/world/tamil-leaders-go-to-india-for-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1987-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 678, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TAMIL LEADERS GO TO INDIA FOR TALKS", "print_headline": "TAMIL LEADERS GO TO INDIA FOR TALKS", "body_text": " **********India summoned Tamil extremist leaders here for secret talks this week and urged them to negotiate a settlement with the Sri Lankan Government, officials and other sources said today The guerrillas reportedly answered that they would not talk with the Colombo Government until it stopped attacks on Tamil strongholds in the northern Jaffna Peninsula. **********An Indian official familiar with the talks here said Indian officials had told the Tamils, ''There is no alternative to talks.'' **********Tamil separatist groups have been blames for terrorist acts that have claimed hundreds of lives in the last week.

Finished and unfinished computers imported from Japan are subject to a tariff, while electronic parts are not. **********The 24-page Customs decision, which was circulated in the electronics industry last month, was based on a dispute with the Intel Corporation over how to classify circuit boards that the company imported. A Longstanding View **********Customs officials said the decision confirmed a longstanding view by Customs that such ''mother-boards'' were, in essence, computers without covers or peripheral attachments. However, because that view had not been widely known or enforced, the decision surprised computer makers. They are asking the Treasury Department to reverse the decision. **********''Our members tell us they have been importing these things for 15 years and they have always been classified as parts,'' said Charlotte LeGates, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based computer trade group, which has 33 members, including the American subsidiaries of several major Japanese companies. **********Computer makers are especially concerned that wording of the Intel decision also seems to reclassify unfinished disk drives and other equipment as finished peripherals, according to David Rose, trade relations manager for customs and licensing at Intel, which is not a member of the trade group. **********Two years ago, the decision would not have much of a difference. But changes in tariffs since then - especially President Reagan's decision to place a 100 percent tariff on some Japanese products in April - now make the classifications a multimillion-dollar concern for many companies, according to Ms. LeGates. Changes in the Tariffs **********Both electronic parts and computers from Japan were formerly subject to equal tariffs. But in 1986 the United States dropped its tariff on electronic parts as part of an agreement with Japan and Canada that eliminated tariffs on a broad range of American electronic products in Japan. Today, finished and unfinished computers from Japan carry a 3.9 percent tariff and finished peripherals a 3.7 percent tariff, while the parts are tariff free. **********Since the 1986 agreement, Customs officials have begun to look more closely at how electronics importers classify their goods. Intel and some smaller importers were told that circuit boards had been improperly labeled as tariff-free parts. But enforcement was apparently sporadic. **********''We don't see everything, so it's possible lots of people were bringing them into the country under the wrong classification and getting away with it,'' one Customs official conceded. In addition, enforcement had been uneven because of disagreements within the Customs Service about whether circuit boards with microprocessors should be classified as computers in all cases. **********The stakes increased sharply in April after the United States retaliated against Japan for dumping of semiconductors by placing 100 percent tariffs on a variety of Japanese products. The Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, for instance, has complained that tariffs on circuit boards it makes for the International Business Machines Corporation have jumped to 104 percent. **********According to the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, the Customs ruling places so many products under the sanctions that the Administration's target of applying the 100 percent tariffs to $180 million of Japanese imports will be quickly exceeded. **********American companies are also concerned that the Customs Service's decision will increase trade frictions and might be seen by the Japanese as a violation of the 1986 tariff agreement with Canada and Japan. ''One fear we have here is that Japan could retaliate by restoring its tariffs on completed computers, peripherals and parts,'' Intel's Mr. Rose said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/18/business/honda-expansion-us-exports-a-goal.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Ross", "pub_date": "1987-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1070, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Honda Expansion: U.S. Exports a Goal", "print_headline": "Honda Expansion: U.S. Exports a Goal", "body_text": " **********The Honda Motor Company today announced a four-year plan to expand its American production to the point where it could export about 50,000 cars to Japan each year. **********Honda executives said the No. 4 domestic car maker would build a second car assembly plant in central Ohio for about $380 million to increase its domestic production by 42 percent, spend $150 million to expand its American engine plant and bolster its local research and development. **********As a result, the company's American branch will be able to produce an additional 150,000 cars a year, the executives said. That would put Honda in a position to export 70,000 cars a year, more than any American company exported in 1987. Effect of the Weaker Dollar **********The move reflects both Honda's concern about protectionist sentiment in the United States and the dollar's fall in value against the Japanese yen. Jeff Leestma, a Honda spokesman, said that the weaker dollar had eliminated the cost advantage of building autos in Japan. **********He said it now costs about as much to build cars in Japan and ship them to the United States as it does just to build them here. **********The expansion, which was encouraged by incentives from the State of Ohio, and other spending plans will raise Honda's capital investment in American manufacturing by about $1 billion, to $1.7 billion, and add about 3,500 employees to its Ohio workforce by 1991. **********''With all these efforts, we will develop our U.S. operations to the point that we will have a self-reliant, integrated motor vehicle company capable of competing in the world marketplace,'' said Tadashi Kume, president of Honda Motor, at a news conference in Columbus, Ohio. **********Honda will build the new plant in East Liberty, Ohio, near its first operation in Marysville. The new plant is scheduled to open in 1989 and would bring total American production to 510,000 cars a year, from the current 360,000. By comparison, Honda's Japanese operation made 500,000 cars last year and is projecting 550,000 for 1987. 'A Shot at Third Place' **********If, in 1991, Honda were to sell 440,000 American-made cars and its import quota of 420,000 Japanese-made vehicles in the United States, the company would still trail the Chrysler Corporation, which sold 1.2 million vehicles last year. But John Hammond, an analyst with J. D. Power & Associates, an auto research concern, said that some of Honda's increased sales might come at the expense of the No. 3 domestic auto maker. **********''They've got a shot at third place,'' Mr. Hammond said of Honda. ''The next step is to move their world headquarters to America. I've heard rumors that they're considering it.'' 'Transplant Factories' **********Mr. Hammond noted that Honda, like other Japanese auto makers, began making cars in the United States to get around the import quotas devised by the Japanese Government in the late 1970's and to insulate itself from swings in currency exchange rates. **********He argued that these ''transplant factories'' made sense when the strong dollar made it cheaper to build in Japan, so they make even more sense since the dollar fell 50 percent against the yen over the last two years. **********''Their principal market is the United States,'' Mr. Hammond said. ''You don't shift manufacturing facilities around the world simply on the basis of short-term movement in exchange rates. Volkswagen tried that in the '70's and was hurt.'' **********In 1982, Honda became the first Japanese auto maker to build cars in the United States. Since then, the Nissan Motor Company and the Mazda Motor Company have followed its lead, and the Toyota Motor Company plans to begin production in the United States in 1989. A spokesman for Toyota, which outsells Honda in the United States, said it planned to build as many as 200,000 cars a year by 1990. Plants Where the Sales Are **********Mr. Hammond said that Toyota might increase its production, but that Nissan had other problems to solve before it could increase its investment in the United States. He added that other Japanese auto makers, such as the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, were less formidable as American manufacturers. **********Mr. Leestma of Honda said that the company had long believed in building cars in the countries in which they are sold. ''We have over 60 manufacturing facilities in over 30 countries,'' he said. **********Mr. Leestma indicated, however, that the cars that Honda would export to Japan would be models that are made only in the United States. **********Honda said the new Ohio factory would be able to produce several models, including its Acura division's two high-performance luxury cars, the $20,000 Legend and the $15,000 Integra. But in August 1989, the first car that rolls out of the East Liberty plant will be a Civic, which costs $8,000 to $12,000. **********Civics and Accords are also produced in Marysville and are imported as well. Economic Contribution **********Tetsuo Chino, the president of Honda North America Ltd., said the company would increase the share of domestic components in its American-made cars from about 50 percent this year to about 67 percent in two years and to 75 percent in 1991. **********Honda employs nearly 5,000 auto workers in the United States and said it will have 8,650 in 1991. The company will also increase the number of engineers in the United States to 500 in 1991, from about 180 now. **********The rural East Liberty site was chosen after the State of Ohio sold its Transportation Reseach Center there to Honda for $31 million. The center had been rented to a number of auto companies for use as a test track. **********The site, which is about five miles from Marysville, had no substantial industry before Honda arrived. A Honda spokesman said that most of the employees had been locally recruited. **********Ohio granted Honda other incentives, including tax abatements and state money to train new employees. **********Honda's employees in Marysville have twice rejected organizing efforts by the United Automobile Workers, which some analysts said contributed to the company's decision to build its second plant nearby."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/03/business/dow-off-10.01-as-volume-edges-up.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1987-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 601, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Off 10.01 as Volume Edges Up", "print_headline": "Dow Off 10.01 as Volume Edges Up", "body_text": " **********Stock prices retreated broadly yesterday as investors sold heavily in the face of a weak dollar and a declining bond market resulting from the news that Paul A.

''The theft has been going on for over a year, so I don't know what left.'' **********Mr. Klink also said that there might be more arrests. Purported Price Is $4 Million **********The three California men arrested Thursday are accused of planning to sell designs for an extremely powerful supercomputer to the Soviet Union for $4 million. Federal officials said that they had recovered tapes and disks containing design information, so it is unclear if material did get to the Soviet Union. **********The Federal officials said it would be ''extremely detrimental'' to the national security of the United States if the designs for the computer got into Soviet hands. Such a high-speed computer could be used to intercept and decipher American communications or, in a war, to detect and help intercept American missiles. **********The men arrested Thursday were Kevin E. Anderson, 36 years old, a software designer; Ivan Pierre Batinic, 29, also a software engineer, and his brother Stevan, 30, a mechanic. Until September Ivan Batinic had worked at the Saxpy Computer Corporation of Sunnyvale, Calif., the company from which the designs were purportedly stolen. **********The three are believed to have conspired with Charles McVey, 57, who the authorities say diverted technology to the Soviet Union for a long period beginning in the 1970's.

The machine is considered especially useful in analyzing electronic signals such as those from sonar and radar. **********Such computer speeds previously were available only on the most powerful machines made by Cray Research Inc, but several companies now produce extremely high-speed machines, making it more difficult for the authorities to control access to sensitive technology. In addition, many fledgling computer companies do not have the elaborate security precautions of the big military contractors. **********''It's my understanding that the company was targeted by the Soviets,'' John P. Viola, chief financial officer of Saxpy, said in an interview. **********Ivan Batinic, a French national, was a software engineer at Saxpy for 15 months. According to the Government's complaint, the company put him on probation in May because his performance was not satisfactory and dismissed him in September. **********Mr. Viola said that Mr. Batinic often volunteered to work alone at night, and he could have taken computer disks and tapes. The company did not have a 24-hour security guard. **********Federal officials said today that the investigation began in August when Ivan Batinic and Mr. Anderson were searched at the customs station in Vancouver, British Columbia, and found to be carrying more than $15,000 in $100 bills. They said the money was given to them by a man named Carlos Julio Williams. Arrest in the Yukon **********About two weeks later, a Canadian police officer arrested Mr. McVey in a small town in the Yukon Territory. Canadian authorities said that he carried a Guatemalan passport with the name Carlos Julio Williams Beltran, as well as a computer manual and chart belonging to Saxpy. **********Federal agents said that an informant met with Mr. Anderson and their conversations were monitored by agents. They also said that agents traced Mr. Anderson as he visited Mr. McVey in jail in Canada and also when he went to Malta.

With its February-March issue Modern Maturity will increase its circulation rate base 10.1 percent, to 17.4 million, and it is well on its way to becoming the country's largest magazine. **********Many magazines consider themselves misunderstood by media departments of ad agencies for one reason or another. Modern Maturity considers itself caught in the middle of a seeming reverse generation gap. **********As explained yesterday by Ina S. Josephson, national sales manager, and Cary Silvers, director of research, the media people at agencies are prone to perceive the over-50 set as washed up. **********''Young agency people really are turned off by that crowd,'' said Franchellie Cadwell, president of Cadwell Davis Partners, the magazine's agency for a couple of years. ''They're afraid to think about it. Just the opposite of the yuppies. **********''Even after you impress them with your numbers, they say, 'Uh-huh,' then don't do anything about it.'' **********In hopes of making older readers easier to take, the magazine commissioned a $60,000 study by the Daniel Yankelovich Group that compared the wants, needs, desires and pastimes of the over-50 group with those of the 39-to-49 set that media people can more easily relate to. **********The study found more similarities than differences. And Modern Maturity's annual trade campaign and a new audio-visual presentation will be based on it. The A-V made its debut yesterday at a luncheon at the Romeo Salta Restaurant. The advertising begins Jan. 4 in the advertising trade press. **********The presentation, which will be taken on the road after three New York luncheons, will hit Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta and Dallas, which could be called advertising's grand circuit. Ms. Josephson calls the presentation ''missionary work.'' **********The print advertising is being billed as a primer on how to advertise to seniors and, indeed, will be bound together and published as a booklet when the campaign ends. The ads all refer to the Yankelovich study. **********Some of the headlines are: ''Talk about romance,'' ''Don't make a long story short,'' ''Entertain them'' and ''Treat them like your brother not your mother.'' **********The tagline, a carry-over from last year, is: ''The beginning of a new lifetime.'' **********The fact that the readers of the magazine are pretty much the same as much younger consumers is also important to the publishers of Modern Maturity. They want to break out of the niche that has the magazine type-cast as a publication that is only for diet-conscious folks and that therefore gets ads only for such things as salt-free or sugar-free products, instead of a food company's whole product line. **********Mr. Silvers, having studied the data at the Publishers Information Bureau, guesses that of total food company ad budgets, only about 15 percent is for dietary products of one kind or another. He does not want his magazine's ad revenues limited like that. **********The publication, which has only carried advertising for seven of its more than 30 years, will run 259 ad pages this year, for total revenues of $42.8 million. **********Neither Ms. Josephson nor her publisher, Peter Hansen, is talking about Modern Maturity becoming America's largest-circulation magazine, but it is a distinct possibility for 1988 since it grows by an average of 250,000 each issue.

Iran asserted that its troops had advanced to within 400 yards of an oil refinery south of the city of Basra, while Iraq continued its heavy bombing of Iranian cities and supply lines. Page A8. ]  U.S. 'Lack of Morals' Assailed In an interview on Saturday, Mr. Ramadan said his country was outraged by ''the lack of morals on the part of the U.S.'' He said the denial of weapons to Iraq while Washington was secretly shipping arms to Iran was ''a treachery and conspiracy that started from the very first day'' that Iraq and the United States restored diplomatic relations in November 1984. **********Mr. Ramadan said Iraq lost Fao, a unused oil port on the Persian Gulf near the border with Kuwait, in February 1986 because of misleading intelligence reports provided by the United States. **********''A few months before the Iranian offensive we detected movements of Iranian troops, but the U.S. kept on telling us that the Iranian attack was not aimed against Fao,'' he said. ''Even when the battle started the Americans kept on sending us reports that it was not the big offensive.'' U.S. Explanation Dismissed **********The Iraqi official said that when Iraq complained, the United States said it had provided Iraq with the only information that was available. ''Who can possibly believe that?'' Mr. Ramadan asked. He called the American response ''totally unacceptable.'' **********It was reported last month that the United States had provided intelligence to Iraq in an effort to offset the effect of American arms shipments to Iran. Last week it was reported that Washington had knowingly provided incorrect or misleading data to both sides.  [ The C.I.A. has emphatically denied providing faulty intelligence to Iran or Iraq. Intelligence sources in Washington said, however, that the data sent to Iran was misleading, and that in one instance it overstated the strength of the Iraqi forces in an effort to prevent Teheran from mounting an attack. The sources said information delivered to Iraq was deliberately incomplete, although several Administration officials insisted that what was given was accurate. ]  Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, resumed diplomatic relations with the United States two years ago after a 17-year break over American support for Israel. Iraq has also drawn closer to pro-Western Arab countries like Jordan and Egypt, which backed it in its war against Iran. But the revelations of the United States' secret shipments of arms to Iran seem to have shattered whatever confidence in Washington that Iraq had developed. U.S. Objectives Outlined **********Mr. Ramadan, who is acting as head of Government while President Hussein devotes most of his time to the war, said the American arms sales to Iran and misinformation to Iraq were part of the same premeditated policy aimed at increasing American influence in the regions to achieve two goals: **********First, he said, the United States wanted to prolong the war in order to use the Iranian threat to scare the Gulf Arab states, including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, into accepting American intervention and allowing more United States military bases in the region. **********Second, he said, the United States was seeking to buy back its influence in Iran. **********The Iraqi leadership has never abandoned its hard-line opposition to a negotiated settlement with Israel, but in the mid-1980's the heavy economic and military burden of the war led Iraq to normalize relations with the United States. **********But Iraq also sought a balanced relationship with the Soviet Union, and during the last year, relations between Moscow and Baghdad warmed up as the Soviet Union expressed support of Iraq's efforts to seek a peaceful end to the war. **********Despite Iraq's anger against Washington's actions, Iraqi leaders and some Arab diplomats say they beleive that the revelations of Washington's Iran arms dealings have strengthened Iraq's political standing in the Arab and Islamic world. **********''The revelations of the U.S. secret with Iran, and the role of israel in the affair, have provided another factor of strength to Iraq since it has proved its longstanding argument that Iran was not and could not be an ally of the Arab world,'' Mr. Ramadan said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/03/business/a-port-s-rush-to-streamline.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1987-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1560, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A PORT'S RUSH TO STREAMLINE", "print_headline": "A PORT'S RUSH TO STREAMLINE", "body_text": " **********Near berth 132, the Port of Los Angeles is building a terminal for the Mitsui O.S.K. Line's huge container ships. Up the channel a bit the port is expanding a complex to accommodate the flood of Japanese auto imports. And just inland, the finishing touches are being put on a facility to speed the transfer of cargo between ships and rail and truck lines. **********The improvements are being made to help this port do what ports have always tried to do - move goods more quickly and efficiently. But there is an urgency to these changes, and a flurry of others, born of shifting trade patterns, improving transportation technology - and growing competition. **********All ports are moving to deal with the same general forces. Faced with attracting fewer steamship lines carrying greater cargo loads, port authorities are taking a more active role in the development of facilities and land management. To insulate themselves against currency fluctuations and trade legislation, they are working harder to diversify the cargo they handle. **********Perhaps most important, ports are becoming more aggressive in marketing themselves to shipping lines, importers and exporters to insure that they survive what experts describe as a continuing consolidation. Major Program in New York **********In New York harbor, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is spending half a billion dollars over five years to deepen channels for container ships to 40 feet from 35 feet, buy stronger cranes to lift the containers and provide significantly more space for container storage, according to Robert Steiner, the deputy director of the port. **********The Baltimore port is in the midst of a $400 million dredging and capital improvement plan, and in the last two years has doubled its international advertising budget, to $500,000. New Orleans just introduced a program to guide development there into the next century. **********''Just as the big steamship lines are going to get bigger, the big ports are going to get bigger,'' said Roy Perry, a consultant and former head of the Los Angeles and Tacoma, Wash., ports. Thomas Dowd, professor of port and marine transport management at the University of Washington in Seattle, said, ''If you're not highly competitive, you're not going to be around for long.'' **********Every port's situation is somewhat different. The export-oriented ports of the Northeast, including New York, are stagnating because of the decline of manufacturing in that region and the effects of years of a strong dollar. Ports on the Gulf of Mexico are struggling with the oil slump. Import-oriented harbors, by contrast, especially on the West Coast, are generally flourishing. Los Angeles Port Booms **********The changes being wrought at America's ports are particularly visible here in Los Angeles. The point of entry for many of the goods destined for the huge, affluent Southern California consumer market, and one of the hubs of the growing Pacific Basin trade, the Los Angeles port, along with its neighbor in San Pedro harbor, the Port of Long Beach, has become one of the nation's busiest, fastest-growing and most profitable. **********''We've found ourselves in a much more complex, competitive environment,'' said Steven P. Resnick, the marketing director for the Port of Los Angeles. **********Driving many of the changes is the rise of intermodalism - systems by which huge cargo containers can be transferred between ships and rail or truck lines. Intermodalism has become the transportation method of choice for many shippers since the deregulation of rail and truck rates in 1980 made it much less expensive. **********The effect of the closer links between sea and land transport systems has been to decrease the number of port calls a ship makes. Often, it is cheaper for a ship to make just one or two stops, and have import cargo routed by land to other destinations. Coast-to-Coast Competition **********Cargo now flows to harbors that can move it most quickly and inexpensively, which are not necessarily those closest to the destination. So Los Angeles often finds itself competing not just with neighboring Long Beach, but with New York or New Orleans or Seattle. ''That's the real competitive factor,'' Mr. Dowd said. **********The most visible result has been investment in intermodal facilities. The Los Angeles port, along with Long Beach and the Southern Pacific Corporation, is building a 160-acre, $62 million intermodal rail yard, one of the largest of its kind, at the edge of San Pedro harbor. It will allow many shippers to transfer containers between sea and rail lines without transporting the containers 20 miles by truck to downtown rail yards. **********''Both ports recognized that whatever it costs, they have to have one,'' Mr. Dowd said of the intermodal complex. **********Without it, they would have been at an increasing competitive disadvantage. Tacoma, for example, which built on on-dock intermodal yard in 1981, has in the last several years won a growing share of West Coast container traffic, especially that headed to the Midwest and the East Coast. Managing the Land **********The rise of containerized shipping, which has grown to dominate the industry in the last 20 years, and the demand for efficient loading and unloading have also placed a premium on land management. Land around most harbors is scarce, and must be allocated and leased by port authorities to insure most efficient use of the space and to keep cargo moving the fastest. **********Most of the space is set aside for containers. They carry high-value cargo, such as television sets and clothes, rather than bulk commodities like coal, and the competition is most fierce for them. **********Container traffic in Los Angeles grew nearly 14 percent last year and is projected to rise steadily for many years. The new $30 million terminal for Mitsui is just one example of how the port is coping with the increase. **********Another $43 million is being spent on two other new container terminals that will be used by other lines. Each will have the most up-to-date cranes and conveyor systems to keep the containers moving rapidly, and added space for container storage. Moving Inland **********To make room for the containers, auto storage facilities are being moved farther inland, as have smaller operations such as a grain storage terminal. **********Port managers are lucky in at least one respect: They can create more space by dredging and using the fill to build new wharves. The Los Angeles port is creating a new 350-acre pier by deepening part of the harbor. **********Port officials said, however, that it was no longer enough to have good facilities and efficient operations. Such complexes need a hard sell, because other ports boast of similar improvements. **********''You can't just take someone out to lunch anymore and expect to get their cargo,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''Now you have to come in with a computerized study of cargo movement.'' Offices Overseas **********Almost all big ports have marketing offices in foreign cities. Los Angeles has representatives in Tokyo, Taipei, Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Copenhagen and Melbourne, Australia - and is hoping to open offices soon in Rio de Janeiro and in Santiago, Chile. ''We're as competitive in the international arena as an I.B.M. or a Boeing,'' said Mr. Resnick, the port's marketing director. **********In the case of Los Angeles, the improvements and the marketing appear to have paid off. Last year, 51.1 million tons of cargo moved through the port, up 13 percent from the year before. Revenues, which are generated by land rentals and a tariff on cargo, increased 24 percent, to $115.5 million. Net income of $58 million was 19 percent higher than in 1985. (As a municipal agency, all profits are plowed back into port's capital improvements.) Just as important as overall growth, in the view of some port officials, is winning a greater share of the relatively weak export trade, in preparation for the possibility that a weaker dollar or protectionist legislation might curtail imports. ''I want to refocus us to exports,'' Mr. Resnick said. **********Last year, he said, Los Angeles was successful in winning a bigger portion of cotton exports to the Far East. The traditional West Coast exports have been bulk commodities like scrap metal and coal, which fuel industry in Japan and throughout Asia. Last year, bulk commodity exports increased 35.5 percent in Los Angeles. **********While Los Angeles, Long Beach and a few others gain market share in a wide range of imports and exports, smaller ports, including San Diego and San Francisco, are losing ground. That is prompting some experts to suggest that smaller harbors start thinking about specializing in certain cargos to survive. Structural steel, for example, is an unattractive import for many big harbors because it takes up too much space. But for a smaller port without much other business, it might make sense."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/29/world/greek-junta-backers-march.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greek Junta Backers March", "print_headline": "Greek Junta Backers March", "body_text": " **********More than 4,000 backers of Greece's military dictatorship of 1967-74 marched through Athens today demanding the immediate release of 17 former officers serving prison terms.

Rather, many said that the day's activity could mark the beginning of a modest technical correction from the lows reached during the recent sharp selloff. The market remains in a decidedly bearish frame of mind, participants said. **********For a day at least, the sober outlook did not seem to concern traders, who on Tuesday were forced to cope with a market that was in no mood to buy. **********''What a difference a day makes,'' said a government securities dealer at a major New York investment bank. ''Yesterday the world was definitely ending. But today our flow of business was very good. I can't say for sure if it was touched off by a certain yield level, but some impressive portfolios turned up with some cash, and started buying some bonds.'' Trade Rumor Spurs Selling **********By late in the day, the Government's bellwether 8 7/8 percent 30-year issue was offered at 92 22/32, up 7/32, to yield 9.622 percent. During overnight trading, rumors circulating in Tokyo that tomorrow's report on United States trade could show a deficit of as much as $20 billion prompted heavy selling, and sent the 30-year issue tumbling to a low of about 91 3/4, to yield 9.73 percent. **********The rumors were soon discounted, and prices of Treasury issues began to firm as trading shifted to Europe and later to New York. Still, the overnight low in Tokyo was something of a milestone. **********''In four weeks, the yield on the long bond has gone up 100 basis points,'' said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a managing director at Drexel Burnham Lambert. **********The current 30-year issue was first offered to investors a month ago today. A day after the auction, its price moved to a premium of par, with the yield falling to 8.72 percent. **********The steep and swift rise in rates is the main reason why analysts are saying that the market has more than discounted all of the potential bad news about the trade deficit, possible further increases in the discount rate and a strengthening economy, and is poised for a correction. 'Technically Oversold' **********''The market has moved more in a shorter period of time than most people would have thought possible,'' said Paul Kasriel, a vice president and monetary economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ''It is technically oversold, and I think it is vulnerable to some sort of rally in what remains a bear market.'' **********Mrs. Ramirez said that ''at these yield levels, the market has more than discounted another, similar half-point increase in the discount rate, as well as a trade deficit figure of at least $16 billion. Only a figure in the $18 billion to $20 billion range could damage the market.'' **********Although most analysts are expecting the deficit to come in between $15 billion and $16 billion, lower estimates are beginning to crop up. Market participants said yesterday that one major foreign bank had informed clients that it expected the figure to be between $14 billion and $15 billion, an improvement from the $15.71 billion deficit reported for June. **********Yesterday's recovery in bond prices was not confined to the long end of the market. Intermediate and shorter-term maturities also moved off the lows recorded on Tuesday.

Col. Oliver L. North. Here are excerpts from the testimony, as recorded by The New York Times. **********SENATOR JAMES A. McCLURE, Republican of Idaho. The United States policy was and is a neutrality - if that's the right word - between our policy towards Iran and our policy towards Iraq. **********NORTH. That was our publicly stated policy, but members of the intelligence committee already know that we were not entirely neutral in that activity. **********Q. And that that stated policy was not the same as Israel's stated policy. **********A. No, it was not. **********Q. Part of our stated policy was also to bring about an end to the war. **********A. It is. It was and it is. **********Q. That's not Israel's stated policy. **********A. I'm not entirely sure, Senator, that I could clearly state what their public policy is. But clearly, they were not as interested in ending the war as we were. **********Q. As a matter of fact, from an Israeli standpoint the continuation of the war that keeps Iraq occupied -- **********A. Is to their benefit.  * * * **********REPRESENTATIVE LOUIS STOKES, Democrat of Ohio. There is no plausible denial as far as the President is concerned. The establishment of permanent intelligence committees - oversight committees in the Congress - means there is no plausible denial to Congress. What we seek to do in covert operations is to mask the role of the United States from other countries, not from our own Government. **********Let's examine the operations that you conducted. Mr. Ghorbanifar and his associates were aware, the Israelis were aware, Mr. Khashoggi, Mr. Furmark were aware, international arms dealers knew, the Iranians knew. When you went to Teheran in May, all the Iranians knew your identity and that of Mr. McFarlane. When you brought the second channel to the United States, you gave them a midnight tour of the White House. You even had President Reagan inscribe a Bible for presentation to the Iranians. **********So there was no plausible denial as far as these outsiders were concerned. Our sworn enemies knew. And eventually, I believe, they exposed our covert arms sales. **********So my question is, didn't anyone involved in this operation ever say that all of our cutouts and secrecy won't work? That plausible denial couldn't protect us? That it would be those who did know who eventually would betray us?  * * * **********A. I think that plausible deniability is still a factor. Whether we're talking about plausible deniability for the President or the executive branch or the whole involvement of the Government of the United States is still an issue that needs to be considered in any of these activities. So I guess what I'm saying to you is, yes there were always foreigners who were aware. There are foreigners who are aware in almost every one of our covert operations undertaken that are approved by your committee. I mean, when your committee approves a covert action finding signed by the President, the expectation is that the role of the Government of the United States is not to be revealed.  * * * **********Q. But Colonel, the only thing I'm saying in terms of your plausible deniability here, the only persons to whom you were denying plausibility were Americans. All the foreigners knew who you were. **********A. But they didn't. Congressman Stokes, that is precisely my point. . . . Yes, there were foreigners involved but all Iranians didn't know or there would have been another revolution in Iran. All Europeans didn't know. The Israelis knew and certain Israelis knew. And that is, after all, the essence of the operation. It wasn't - it wasn't done as a means of simply keeping it from the Congress.  * * * **********SENATOR SAM NUNN, Democrat of Georgia. You testified . . . that . . . Mr. Ghorbanifar quote took me into the bathroom and suggested several incentives to make the February transaction work, and the attractive incentive to me was the one he made that residuals could flow to support the Nicaraguan resistance end quote. Do you recall that testimony? **********A. Yes, sir. **********Q. You mention several incentives. Do you recall any of the other incentives, besides -- **********A. I recall one specifically. **********. . . And that was Mr. Ghorbanifar offered me a million dollars if we could make this prosper. **********Q. To you personally? **********A. Yes, sir. **********Q. So he offered a bribe to you right there on the spot? **********A. Yes, sir. **********Q. And tell us what you said in response to that. **********A. It was out of the question. **********Q. You told him you would not accept any financial favors - is that right? **********A. Could not, would not, and that if those kinds of discussions pursued that he would be out of the picture very quickly, and it was then that he came up with what I considered to be a far better idea.  * * * **********REPRESENTATIVE EDWARD P. BOLAND, Democrat of Massachusetts. Colonel North, I finally made it. I know you'd be disappointed if I didn't talk a little bit about the Boland Amendments, which from Oct. 1 of 1984 until Oct. 18 of 1986, prohibited the provision of military assistance to the contras. **********The amendments are much maligned. It has been called so many different things during the course of these hearing, but I sort of like it best when it is described simply as it was - the law.  * * * **********Colonel, in my judgment the law was clear. It authorized the provision of certain types of intelligence information to the contras. It did not authorize C.I.A. officials to coordinate the aerial supply or resupply of arms to the contra units in the field. **********And as you might agree, the supply of fighting units in the field is a military operation. And C.I.A. participation in that type of operation was not authorized by law. That's correct, isn't it? **********A. I am not certain of that, Mr. Boland.  * * * **********Q. Now you've testified in great detail about Director Casey's knowledge of and interest in your activities on behalf of the contras. . . . Was there ever a time when Director Casey told you to do something that you didn't do it? **********A. I didn't get a lawyer soon enough. **********Q. You know you're many things -you're many great things - but there's one thing you really do great and that's keep magnificent memos, beautiful penmanship, no cross-out, you know exactly what you're doing all of the time, you write it down in perfect English and perfect language. Now in the documents that you supplied to this committee indicate clearly that you were an inveterate note-taker. How about Mr. Casey. Did he take notes when you met with him? **********A. No, on a number of occasions I walked into the director's office or were in meetings with the director and he would tell me to put away the notebook, that if I couldn't remember it I didn't belong in the business. **********REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL DeWINE, Republican of Ohio. All right, let me move on to Elliott Abrams . . . You've testified that you believed Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams was aware of your activities and I want to ask you some specific questions, if I could. . . . Did you ever have a discussion about the southern front, the opening up of that, with Elliott Abrams, that you can recall? **********A. As I have testified, the opening of a southern front was viewed as an absolute political and military necessity by everybody on the restricted interagency group. And there's no doubt that I told members of the group that an airfield was being built by the private benefactor organization, or whatever - Project Democracy, whatever euphemism I used at the time, and that it was being done with the assistance of people at the embassy. **********Q. Do you recall - and I don't want to quibble with you here, and I appreciate your recollection - do you recall any specific conversation with Elliott Abrams about that? I appreciate what you've said but I'd like to know that. **********A. I do not recall a specific conversation. There is no doubt that that subject came up at some length and there was, after all, a conference call among Ambassador Tambs, Mr. Abrams and myself one evening when the exposure of that airfield became an issue. **********Q. When it became an issue. Do you ever recall any conversation with Elliott Abrams about any other aspect of that prior to that date? Prior to when it became an issue? **********A. No, but I would point out again, when I called him or he called me or however it worked, neither of us were surprised. **********DAVID L. BOREN, Democrat of Oklahoma. **********Did you participate in or advocate any . . . plan to suspend the Constitution in the event of national crisis such as nuclear war, violent and widespread internal dissent or national opposition to a U.S. invasion abroad? **********A. Absolutely not. **********Q. To your knowledge, has the government of the United States adopted any such plan or does it have in place, in being, any such plan? **********A. No, sir, none.  * * * **********PETER W. RODINO Jr., Democrat of New Jersey. These committees have heard evidence that D.E.A. agents worked with you in your efforts to locate and free the hostages held in Lebanon. My question: Did you brief the Attorney General on that activity? **********A. It is my recollection that I did personally brief the Attorney General. **********Q. Did you tell the Attorney General that private funds were going to be used to bribe foreign officials and others to locate and free the hostages? **********A. That is my recollection, sir.  * * * **********SENATOR DANIEL K. INOUYE, Democrat of Hawaii. Colonel North, we're just about finished, do you have any final statement to make, sir? **********NORTH. A very brief one, sir. **********INOUYE. Please proceed. **********NORTH.

This has led Prime Minister Jacques Chirac to appeal for calm and ''reason.'' **********Speaking of a growing ''phenomenon of exasperation'' among the public, Mr. Chirac said today, ''I wouldn't want these movements to lead to initiatives undertaken by irresponsible or politicized minorities where there would be clashes among the French.'' **********''Let reason return to everyone,'' Mr. Chirac said in a statement delivered this morning in his office as Mayor of Paris. ''Let the disorder brought about by certain strikers and certain groups stop.'' Mood of the Country **********Mr. Chirac's comments reflected a mood of crisis in this country, a sense of a slow disintegration of public functions that began nearly four weeks ago. **********The strikes, accepted at first with a remarkable degree of tolerance and good humor among the French, have by now produced a long list of worries. Among these are simple irritation at disruptions of public services, a concern that the economy will be profoundly damaged by the duration of the walkouts and fears that the authority of Mr. Chirac's conservative Government, which has faced a succession of challenges in recent months, is being sharply eroded. **********''The strikes are illogical, irritating, and going to offend the entire public,'' a subway rider, who gave his name as Bernard, said today. He went on to say that the striking workers are among the best paid and most privileged in France. ''They don't have the right to ruin life for the rest of us,'' he said. **********The Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry published a full-page advertisement in Le Monde today, saying simply, ''International competition does not go on strike.'' The message reflected concern that a falling franc and a failure to deliver on contracts will harm France's ability to sell its products abroad. Some Rail Workers Return **********There were some signs today that railroad workers were drifting back to work after a strike lasting 24 days. After new Government concessions on Thursday night, workers at a number of centers across the country voted this morning to return to their jobs. **********But the main striking union, the Communist-led General Confederation of Labor, rejected the Government's offer of small salary increases and improved working conditions and vowed to spread the strike to the transport systems of provincial cities. The union, known by the initials C.G.T., has been accused by the Government of trying to ''sabotage'' Mr. Chirac's entire program. **********The C.G.T. issued a statement saying conservative parties had decided on ''a political escalation totally foreign to the objects of the actions in progress.'' **********The union said the Government ''bears the total responsibility for the disruption imposed on users that it is holding hostage and the economic consequences that have resulted in numerous domains.'' Blackouts in Paris **********Meanwhile, the strikes in the Paris subway and bus system and in the electric company, called to protest sharp limits on pay increases, worsened Thursday and today. Some 40 percent of the electric company's employees have failed to show up to work, causing partial blackouts throughout Paris and in the provinces. **********The occupations of electric-company offices here by merchants and artisans was cited as a strong sign of growing public impatience with the strike. **********''We have nothing against the strikers,'' said one shopkeeper, who did not give his name. ''But while they are fighting for wage increases, we are fighting for the survival of our enterprises and for our livelihoods.'' **********Hospitals reported today that the electricity outages had interfered with surgery and such vital medical procedures as kidney dialysis. **********Jean Daurat, an orthopedic surgeon at the Ambroise Pare Clinic, said he had gone in his surgical gown to the power company headquarters and a local police station to plead that electricity, which was cut off at the end of an operation, be restored. A Determined Government **********One rightist legislator, Roland Nungesser, appealed for the public to gather for a large demonstration similar to one that took place here in 1968, after several weeks of protests and demonstrations by students and workers against the Goverment of President Charles de Gaulle. **********''What I fear the most as the days go by is a phenomenon of exasperation,'' Mr. Chirac said. The strikes have in essence pitted workers demanding higher wages and better working conditions against the Government, which is determined to prevent a new cycle of inflation. They have produced enormous inconvenience as subways and trains have generally run at less than 50 percent of capacity, frustrating commuters and vacationers, but they have never entirely shut down any of France's major public services. **********This is because, unlike the United States, workers at any given enterprise are divided among three or four competing unions, some of them - such as the C.G.T. - close to a political party. While a majority of workers are unionized, there are no closed shops and there is little strike discipline, so, throughout the weeks of the walkouts, some service has been assured by nonstriking workers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/08/business/company-news-new-products-shown-by-atari.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 250, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Products Shown by Atari", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; New Products Shown by Atari", "body_text": " **********The Atari Corporation, which has regained profitability largely because of the success of its 520 and 1040 ST personal computers, introduced a new ST today aimed at professional users.

Shultz might not be able to hold conversations safe from eavesdropping inside the building when he visits the Soviet Union on April 13. **********The possibility that advanced listening devices may have been placed throughout the embassy, including the most sensitive communications and meeting rooms, has been raised by the revelation that at least two marines assigned to the embassy's security detail allowed Soviet agents into the building. The marines have admitted to unauthorized socializing with Soviet women. **********The officials said the State Department was reluctant to delay Mr. Shultz's meetings with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and other senior Soviet officials, and had been arguing that at least some parts of the embassy could be swept clean of possible listening devices. 'Move the Work Real Fast' **********''How does he talk in the embassy?'' one official asked. ''It's a contentious issue, and some people in State want to move the work real fast.'' **********The two marines charged with allowing Soviet spies into the embassy belonged to an elite guard battalion. The battalion commander said today that ranking officers rarely visited the Moscow embassy guards and regarded their supervision as a State Department job.  [ Page A6. ]  Administration officials said that because of concern that the agents had placed devices in the communications equipment in the Moscow embassy, the embassy was now being forced to halt all sensitive communications. Messages are now being flown by courier to Frankfurt, where they are transmitted to the United States. **********The officials said it was not clear when the communications from Moscow would be resumed. They added that Mr. Shultz was expected to use the systems aboard his plane to transmit messages to the State Department. **********Administration officials, meanwhile, said intelligence analysts assessing the extent of the damage were proceeding on a ''worst case'' assumption that the Russians were able to read all of the coded communications sent from the embassy during the last year. But officials said American intelligence analysts had not yet found any conclusive evidence that proved the communications systems were compromised. **********One official, who said the espionage case was potentially one of the most damaging in history, cautioned: ''This could all turn out to be a tempest in a teapot. I hope so. But I doubt it.'' **********Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the security breach and its ramifications were ''under investigaton.'' **********''It certainly was a very serious breach,'' he said, adding that President Reagan had been fully briefed by the staff of the National Security Council. Removing Code Machines **********Administration officials said the code machines that put messages into a scrambled form to avoid interception would be removed from the Moscow embassy, returned to the United States and taken apart and minutely examined by experts from the National Security Agency. At that point, officials said, they expect to find a tiny transmitting device similar to the advanced technology used by the Russians to eavesdrop on the electronic typewriters in the embassy. **********Code machines work by taking letters and transforming them into electronic signals that can be deciphered at the other end. They have grown increasingly sophisticated, but experts said they could still be defeated if a listening device was inserted in them before the letters were scrambled. **********Another way to defeat a code machine occurred in the espionage case involving John A. Walker, the former Navy officer, when the Russians obtained a code machine, its manuals and the key cards that program it. It is possible that all this material could have been obtained from the Moscow embassy. **********The officials said it would be difficult to prepare a detailed damage assessment without full cooperation of the two Marine guards charged with espionage in the case. Even if investigators eventually received a complete account, it would probably still not be possible to determine conclusively how skilled the Soviet agents were in piercing the code systems or locked files because the marines themselves probably did not closely monitor what the agents were doing, the officials said. Carlucci Request Reported **********The Los Angeles Times reported today that the Justice Department had rejected a request from Frank C. Carlucci, the President's national security adviser, that the Marine guards be given leniency in exchange for their coooperation. Administration spokesman denied the account, although one official indicated that Mr. Carlucci had expressed some support for exploring the idea of a deal with the guards. **********Officials provided new details today about the espionage cases against the two marines, Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree and Cpl. Arnold Bracy. **********They said the Moscow embassy now had surveillance cameras in many of the sensitive areas suspected of having been penetrated by Soviet agents. But officials said that under the procedures at the time, the cameras and various alarm systems were monitored by a Marine guard. On the evenings in which Sergeant Lonetree is suspected of allowing Soviet agents to enter the embassy, Corporal Bracy was watching the monitors and shutting off the alarms, the officials said. **********Robert E. Lamb, the head of the State Department's bureau of diplomatic security, said today that Mr. Lamb said other State the dDepartment's communications in other embassies around the world had not been compromised. as a result of the espionage case. As for the Moscow embassy, he said, ''We're going to replace an awful lot of equipment in sensitive areas.'' **********While Mr. Lamb would not provide details, specifics, other Administration officials said the State Department would soon ask Congress for a $25 million supplemental appropriation to redress the problems in Moscow and Vienna, where Sergeant Lonetree was stationed after leaving Moscow. **********He Mr. Lamb said the department's damage assessment was still in its preliminary stages and ''the idea that any communication on a specific subject was compromised would be pure speculation.'' **********American officials said the Soviet Union might have gained some tactical advantage in the arms negotiations as a result of the breach of security. **********An American official said the Russians might have gained very important information about official and unofficial contacts between embassy officials and Soviet citizens.

Alfred Dreyfus from charges of treason, has once again become a cause celebre - this time within the Zola family. **********Last month, Sotheby's, the British auction house, announced that Brigitte Place, the author's great-granddaughter, had asked it to sell off the original, handwritten manuscript of the 89-year-old article. **********But days after the auction was announced, Francois Emile-Zola, who is not only a grandson of the author but is also Mrs. Place's father, sued to stop the sale of the manuscript. **********And now it is up to the courts to decide whether Sotheby's will be able to auction off the manuscript that helped bring about the release of Captain Dreyfus. It also caused Zola to be sentenced to a year in prison for libel, and caused the author to flee to England. **********The manuscript is scheduled to be auctioned Dec. 8 in Monaco, along with notes that Zola took during his libel trial as well as hundreds of his letters to his wife. **********Auction experts say the 39-page ''J'accuse'' manuscript, which appeared on Jan. 13, 1898, in L'Aurore, will bring between 3 million and 5 million French francs, or the equivalent of between $525,000 and $875,000. Indeed, the manuscript is considered such a valuable part of France's patrimony that the nation's Minister of Culture, Francois Leotard, has insisted that no matter who buys it, the manuscript must be kept in France. **********Zola's article, which threw the French state into upheaval, helped establish the practice of robust investigative journalism by detailing the miscarriages of justice in the Dreyfus Affair, in which a young Jewish army captain was sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil's Island. Indeed, Jean Jaures, the 19th-century French intellectual and politician, called Zola's broadside ''the greatest revolutionary act of the century.'' **********In his lawsuit, Francois Emile-Zola contends that his daughter does not have the right to sell the manuscript according to the will of his father, Jacques Emile-Zola, who was the author's son. The will, dated June 12, 1961, states, ''I ask that the mementoes left to me by my father and mother never be sold.'' He added that ''if my inheritors cannot keep all or part of my collection, I ask them to donate it to the Zola Museum or to the Bibliotheque Nationale.'' **********In addition, two other grandchildren of the author are seeking to block the sale on the ground that divulging all the papers would violate the author's and the family's privacy. But Mrs. Place and her lawyers maintain that her father and the others have no right to challenge the auction because it was she, and not they, who inherited the manuscript. Her lawyers state that Jacques Emile-Zola, the writer's son and author of the will at issue, did not get along very well with his son, Francois Emile-Zola and thus bypassed him in bequeathing the author's mementoes. **********According to Mrs. Place's lawyers, her father should have no say about the disposition of the manuscript because Jacque Emile-Zola's will ceded the mementoes to his spouse and through her, the mementoes passed down to Mrs. Place. Raoul Castelain, lawyer for Mrs. Place, argued before the court that Mrs. Place's father should not be able to complain now because ''she had peaceful possession of the documents since 1963.'' **********A Paris court is expected to decide next week whether to allow the auction to take place. Last Friday, one judge ordered a temporary delay in the auction, saying that any sale could do ''intolerable and irreparable damage'' to the interests of the Zola family. **********Lucian Comoy, a spokesman for Sotheby's, speculated that likely bidders for the ''J'accuse'' manuscript would be museums, large companies or the French Government. Under French law, the Government has the right to pre-empt other bidders by matching the highest bid. **********Administrators at the Zola Museum have voiced their own concerns about the auction.

It would take a marathon eating session of more than 17 - or more than 400 continuous hours at a table - to be exposed to the nicotine ''equivalent'' of a cigarette at a typical New York City restaurant. These scientific findings were based on actual test results from 47 office sites and 48 dining establishments. **********Item: Since 1981, ACVA Atlantic Inc., a Fairfax, Va., company that analyzes indoor air quality, has investigated 125 cases of ''sick building syndrome,'' where office air was suspected of harming the health of employees. Of these cases, only five, or 4 percent, were linked even in part to cigarette smoke in the air, which is known to scientists as environmental tobacco smoke. In another study of 203 buildings suspected of sick-building syndrome, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that only four buildings (2 percent) had indoor air quality problems attributable to cigarette smoke. Both investigations noted, however, that tobacco smoke - the only indoor factor visible to the naked eye - was suspected as the culprit by occupants of most of the buildings. **********Item: Three major international scientific conferences, involving more than 50 eminent scientists, have concluded within the past five years that there is no persuasive evidence that environmental tobacco smoke poses a significant health risk to non-smokers. Even Surgeon General C. Everett Koop admitted in December that more than half of the 16 studies exploring environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in non-smokers have found no consistent, statistically significant relationship. **********Dr. Koop, who acknowledges he would like to see cigarettes banned, is the point man in the anti-smoking lobby's efforts to achieve a ''smoke-free society by the year 2000.'' Dr. Koop has said that the only way this goal will be reached is through piecemeal prohibition - primarily a crazy-quilt patchwork of legislated restrictions and bans in individual cities, counties and states. **********And Dr. Koop is taking no chances in seeing to it that the anti-smoking laws get on the books. To do so, this nation's primary health officer has abused his position, placing his political agenda above scientific integrity. No previous Surgeon General has exploited his office in such a blatantly propagandistic manner. A comparable example might have been if Carrie Nation, in the years before Prohibition, served as Surgeon General and issued a ''scientific'' report providing the political ammunition to secure passage of the 18th Amendment and the Volstead Act. THE recently released Surgeon **********General's report on so-called ''involuntary smoking'' is at odds on key points with a study released in November by the National Academy of Sciences. While the academy's panel expressed concern about the possible effect of smoking in the home, it acknowledged that available scientific evidence does not show that smoking on the job or in public places, such as restaurants, jeopardizes the health of non-smokers. **********But the academy's findings do nothing to advance the Surgeon General's political agenda, since laws are not going to be passed restricting smoking in the home, backyards and private automobiles. Not surprisingly, therefore, when the Surgeon General reviewed precisely the same body of evidence, he came away with the opposite conclusion: Smoking on the job and in public places does jeopardize the health of non-smokers. Dr. Koop apparently realized that without this conclusion, no laws would be passed to further his quest for a smoke-free society. **********The Surgeon General is not alone in subverting science to politics when it comes to environmental tobacco smoke. It is no exaggeration to say that these efforts to alarm non-smokers and force the hand of lawmakers have brought scientific integrity to a crossroads. The pressure from forces dedicated to the prohibition of cigarette smoking is intense. Thus, it will be no small feat for scientists and health experts to discuss the issue with complete objectivity. **********Recent episodes illustrate the kinds of pressure being exerted. One involved a medical education conference at a major university medical center on the health effects of tobacco smoke on non-smokers, funded in part by tobacco companies It was canceled after sustained pressure from anti-smoking activists and organizations, including the United States Office on Smoking and Health, which is headed by Dr. Koop. Following a barrage of calls and letters, several scientists withdrew from the conference at the last moment, forcing cancellation of the session. **********Another recent incident of intimidation involved a professor at a major state university who dared suggest that harm to non-smokers from environmental tobacco smoke has not been proved. His university was threatened by the state's health commissioner with loss of research funding. **********It is telling, indeed, that anti-smokers must resort to these extremes to disguise the fact that proof of harm to non-smokers from passive smoking remains as wispy as cigarette smoke itself."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/15/business/farm-spending-drops.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Farm Spending Drops", "print_headline": "Farm Spending Drops", "body_text": " **********Farmers spent $4.7 billion on new and used machinery last year, down 16 percent from 1985, and another reduction is expected in 1987, the Agriculture Department said today.

But buying was markedly slower on the part of middle- and lower-income shoppers, who were under pressure from debt and employment concerns, retailers said. Sales results covering last month and the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, were obtained in a monthly spot-check of some of New York's major retailers. **********Over all, retail business in the area gained from a booming stock market, the increased activity in the legal and medical professions and in such fields as communications, technology and finance, as well as from increased numbers of foreign tourists. **********''If anything, New York business benefited from the city's unique complexion, the many people who live here, work here and travel here,'' observed James Posner, a retail marketing consultant. Strong Business in New York **********Indeed, executives of chains with major stores in other cities said that their New York business last year reflected larger increases than their stores in other cities. **********''Bloomingdale's sales rise was greater in Manhattan than in such other cities as Boston, Washington, Philadelphia, Dallas and Miami,'' said Julian Taub, Bloomingdale's vice president for planning. He cited the continuing renovation of the Bloomingdale's flagship store and the increased number of foreign visitors to the city. **********Saks Fifth Avenue had a double-digit sales rise in its New York store that made it ''among the five or six top performing stores in our chain of 44,'' said Paul Leblang, senior vice president, marketing. **********At Lord & Taylor, which operates 46 stores, the New England stores had the biggest gains, with the New York area group close to them, said Marshall Hilsberg, the chairman and chief executive. ''Business was generally good, stronger in the first three quarters than in the last, but that quarter was quite acceptable and above our plan.'' **********The year's sales strength came in the middle rather than in the latter months for most retailers. In January, the fiscal year's final month, the average sales gains were up only 3.7 percent in the city and 5 percent in the area, compared with the year earlier. This followed a rather disappointing December - a season when business usually explodes - but that month's median gains were only 3.8 percent higher in the city and 5.8 percent in the area. In the hot summer months, however, when retail sales should subside, the rises in the city were 8.2 percent in July, 13.2 percent in August and 12.6 percent in September. **********In 1985, the top stores had smaller sales gains of 1.2 percent in the city and 2.6 percent in the area, while in 1984 the rises were 6 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively. Two-Way Scramble **********A two-way scramble developed during the year among the big retailers, for disparate reasons. **********R. H. Macy, seeking to sharply increase sales and profits to accelerate payments on its leveraged-buyout debt, intensified its price-cutting efforts. As a result, major rivals, such as Abraham & Straus, Stern's and others, found themselves were swept into a continuous price-slashing competition. **********And the closings of the 10 Gimbels department stores and six Ohrbach stores generated an intensive effort among the remaining chains to win the $300 million-plus in sales that were set loose. Much of it, merchants said, was picked up by smaller retailers catering to lower-income customers. **********''Generally, business was pretty good during the year and a very decent one in 'comparable' stores, those that are at least a year old,'' said Lawrence Stone, president and chief executive of the Stern's department stores. Stern's has acquired two Gimbels store sites, in Yonkers and Garden City, L.I., and will reopen them as Stern's stores soon. ''But the environment was as competitive as in any recent year. It's nonsense to say, as some claim, that because they had their inventories well in line, it wasn't a highly promotional year. Macy's took care of that.'' **********But another retail executive, who requested anonymity, said: ''The higher-priced stores did well, but for everyone else it was a hard year. The consumer was generally a reluctant shopper. Heavy price-cutting hurt profit margins. It appears that those stores with a definite merchandising point-of-view did well but the others struggled.'' Strong Merchandise Categories **********Among the better-performing retailers, business last year was mostly good to strong in all merchandise categories. In home goods, top sales were in linens, blankets and sheets, china, glass and giftware, and non-electric housewares. But among department stores consumer electronics had disappointing sales compared with 1985, when gains were huge, mostly because of the great popularity of video cassette recorders and compact disk players. In soft lines, 1986 was ''a good dress year,'' as Mr. Stone of Stern's put it, and good sales were recorded in shoes, brand names, women's sportswear and men's wear. **********But the lack of any perceptible sales boom from the Gimbels-Ohrbach disappearance and the much better showing of stores catering to the affluent may indicate that New York, especially Manhattan, is moving further into a higher-priced market, according to Mr. Posner, the consultant. **********''New York is unlike any other city, because it has little or no presence from the major, mass-volume chains like Sears, K Mart or Penney's,'' he said. ''But it is seeing great, upscale growth, from such specialty retailers as the Limited, Polo and the Italian chains. Manhattan, in particular, seem to be going that way. The ultimate mecca for international and domestic tourists may be becoming one for the affluent residents, too.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/11/world/montreal-journal-a-city-s-blacks-no-longer-merely-les-invisibles.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1987-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Montreal Journal; A City's Blacks, No Longer Merely Les Invisibles", "print_headline": "Montreal Journal; A City's Blacks, No Longer Merely Les Invisibles", "body_text": " **********Anthony Griffin could scarcely have guessed that an argument with a cab driver here last month would end with Mr. Griffin dead in the parking lot of a police station, victim of a police bullet in the forehead. Much less could he have known that this would become a landmark in the troubled history of one of Quebec's forgotten minorities. **********Mr. Griffin, 19 years old, was one of 120,000 blacks in this city of 2.8 million, a member of an ethnic group that traces its origins back to the establishment of French settlement. According to a recent history of blacks in the province, the first black man to set foot here, Matthew da Costa, came in 1632 with Samuel de Champlain, the French navigator who founded Quebec; da Costa spoke the Micmac language, essential in Champlain's dealings with Indians. **********That footnote, little known in this province of 6.5 million, lends irony to the situation developing in the last 20 years, as Caribbean migrants have multiplied. According to community leaders, being black in Quebec has meant standing on the sidelines of the ethnic struggle here, the push by Quebec's French-speaking majority for broader language and political rights. **********''In Quebec, it is being French-speaking that counts,'' said Dorothy Williams, a historical researcher who works at the Negro Community Center, the oldest of a dozen or more black organizations. ''It's not a question of the black man having got lost; the fact is, he was never found.'' Charged With Manslaughter **********Since the Griffin shooting on Nov. 11, the problems of blacks in Quebec have received wider attention than they received in years. The incident prompted the establishment of an official inquiry, under the Quebec Human Rights Commission, into relations between police forces across the province and racial minorities; and the policeman who killed the black teen-ager, Constable Allan Gosset, has been charged with manslaughter. **********Neither measure satisfied blacks; most demanded a murder charge and questioned whether the Human Rights Commission was capable of a fair inquiry. Ilma Lynton-Holt, executive director of the Negro Community Center, founded 70 years ago, said this was a ''runaround.'' **********According to the police, the incident began with a radio call from a taxi driver complaining that a passenger, Mr. Griffin, was refusing to pay. A police computer check at the scene showed that he was wanted in connection with breaking and entering; he was driven to the police station, where he tried to flee. According to the first police account, Constable Gosset, 38, called on him to halt, then fired; later, the police acknowledged that the youth had stopped and turned around before being killed. **********Constable Gosset was suspended without pay. But it was 10 days before he was charged, and by that time 2,000 protesters, including many whites, had marched on the Palais de Justice. Public concern was heightened after the disclosure that Constable Gosset, a 16-year police veteran, had been accused of a previous racial assault, involving a Ghanaian professor who said he was beaten by the officer in 1981. Then, the police paid an out-of-court settlement of $1,500. Only Surviving Child **********Emotions in the Griffin affair were heightened by the fact that the youth was the only surviving child of a Jamaican immigrant, Gloria Augustus. But among blacks, the incident was seen as the culmination of a pattern of disregard among the authorities going back many years. Many of the problems involve the police; others involve charges of discrimination in housing, in public and private employment and in schools. **********In Canada, Montreal is far from the only city that has had to absorb a growing nonwhite population. Since a change in immigration policy in the late 1960's, hundreds of thousands of people from Asia and the Caribbean have settled here, changing major cities like Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, and spreading out to more remote communities across the Atlantic provinces and the prairies. There are close to 500,000 blacks and perhaps 1.5 million Asians in Canada. **********If the going has been rougher for the immigrants in Montreal, black leaders believe it may be because the city has been absorbed with the fight for advancement of French Canadians, a minority within the country at large but overwhelmingly preponderant in Quebec. The fight, recurrent for a century, ignited in earnest in the 1960's, just as the black community began to grow with migrants from Jamaica, Grenada and Haiti. **********The largest of the black groups in the city are the 40,000 Haitians, coming in as refugees. Although speaking French as a mother tongue has made assimilation somewhat easier - all six of the black police officers in the city are from Haiti - the Haitians have also proved in some respect to be the most assertive, clashing more often with the police and city authorities. **********According to Ms. Lynton-Holt, 42, the new arrivals changed a group that traced its roots to slaves brought here from Africa and the Caribbean in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and to American blacks, some of them also slaves, who fled here between the Revolution and the Civil War. Close-knit and conservative, the blacks worked as porters on the railroads, as domestic servants, rarely coming to public attention. University Protest in 1969 **********Before the Griffin killing, the only major upheaval occurred in 1969, when Caribbean students at Sir George Williams University, protesting against a biology professor who had given low marks to black students, occupied the university computer center, then burned it down. But that outburst, resulting in millions of dollars in damage, did little to advance the black cause among whites; this time, blacks say, white sentiment is strongly on their side. **********One ally is Marvin Rotrand, a 36-year-old city council member who sits on the Police Commission. Mr. Rotrand, a member of an insurgent political movement that swept City Hall elections in November 1986, is spearheading a drive to open up the police complaints procedure, to insure that civilians, not police officers, are in control. **********Mr. Rotrand says he believes that many French Canadians, particularly in the police force, are having trouble adjusting to the idea of Quebec as a multiracial society. In part, he and black leaders say, this is because Quebec educational policies for decades pushed the children of black immigrants into English-speaking schools, a policy reversed in the 70's. **********Mr. Rotrand recalled how his father, survivor of 30 months in Auschwitz, had struggled for acceptance as an immigrant in Montreal after the war. ''Then, too, Quebecers prided themselves on being a particularly tolerant society,'' he said. ''But I've always thought that that was a lot of hokum. In these things, people here are much like everyone else; it takes time for them to adjust.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/15/world/reagan-rejects-salvadoran-plea-on-illegal-aliens.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1987-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 756, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN REJECTS SALVADORAN PLEA ON ILLEGAL ALIENS", "print_headline": "REAGAN REJECTS SALVADORAN PLEA ON ILLEGAL ALIENS", "body_text": " **********President Reagan today turned down a plea from the President of El Salvador to give temporary refuge to thousands of Salvadorans living illegally in this country. **********The State Department said the United States had decided that it could not make an exception to the new immigration law, despite an impassioned request President Jose Napoleon Duarte made last month. **********Illegal aliens from El Salvador have already begun returning home because they cannot legally be hired in this country.

Economic Impact Feared **********In a letter dated April 10, Mr. Duarte asked Mr. Reagan to let the Salvadorans remain temporarily in this country. He said that ''the massive return of Salvadorans from the United States would add to the already disastrous levels of unemployment and economic crisis'' in his country. **********He said 400,000 to 600,000 Salvadorans, representing about 10 percent of his country's population, had entered the United States illegally since January 1982 and thus would not qualify for amnesty under the new law. Mr. Duarte said these people sent home remittances of $350 million to $600 million a year. **********In his letter to Mr. Duarte, President Reagan said he had asked Secretary of State George P. Shultz ''to bring your concerns to the urgent attention of the Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and to work with them to insure that the effects you fear do not occur.'' **********Administration officials said it was unlikely large numbers of Salvadorans would return home, even though the new law was designed to encourage the departure of illegal aliens. **********Under the law, employers may continue to employ illegal aliens who were hired before Nov. 6, 1986, when President Reagan signed the immigration bill. But these aliens are locked into their current jobs; they cannot legally be hired by any other employer. **********Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, said last month that he supported Mr. Duarte's request. But Administration officials said it had been opposed by other Presidential appointees, including Mr. Nelson, Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Michael H. Armacost, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. **********Mr. Duarte had asked Mr. Reagan to defer the deportation of Salvadorans by giving them a special status known as ''extended voluntary departure.'' The Justice Department has granted a similar dispensations to people from Afghanistan and Poland and, on a more limited basis, to Ethiopians. **********The rejection of Mr. Duarte's request is likely to intensify interest in legislative proposals to defer the deportation of Salvadorans. Such bills have been introduced by Representative Joe Moakley of Massachusetts and Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, both Democrats. Most Seeking Asylum Rejected **********Many Salvadorans have applied for asylum in the United States, but few applications have been approved. In the last fiscal year, the immigration service granted asylum to 55 Salvadorans and denied 1,149 applications. **********To qualify for asylum, an alien must show ''a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/04/business/south-africa-reacts-angrily-to-sullivan-call.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 617, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA REACTS ANGRILY TO SULLIVAN CALL", "print_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA REACTS ANGRILY TO SULLIVAN CALL", "body_text": " **********The South African Government reacted angrily tonight to a call by the Rev.

What respect is due to the human embryo, taking into account his nature and identity? **********The human being must be respected - as a person - from the very first instant of his existence. **********The implementation of procedures of artificial fertilization has made possible various interventions upon embryos and human foetuses. The aims pursued are of various kinds: diagnostic and therapeutic, scientific and commercial. From all of this, serious problems arise. Can one speak of a right to experimentation upon human embryos for the purpose of scientific research? What norms or laws should be worked out with regard to this matter? The response to these problems presupposes a detailed reflection on the nature and specific identity - the word ''status'' is used - of the human embryo itself. **********At the Second Vatican Council, the Church for her part presented once again to modern man her constant and certain doctrine according to which: ''Life once conceived, must be protected with the utmost care; abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes.'' More recently the Charter of the Rights of the Family, published by the Holy See,  [ 23 ]  confirmed that ''Human life must be absolutely respected and protected from the moment of conception.''  [ 24 ] **********This Congregation is aware of the current debates concerning the beginning of human life, concerning the individuality of the human being and concerning the identity of the human person. The Congregation recalls the teachings found in the Declaration on Procured Abortion: ''From the time that the ovum is fertilized, a new life is begun which is neither that of the father nor of the mother: it is rather the life of a new human being with his own growth. It would never be made human if it were not human already. To this perpetual evidence . . . modern genetic science brings valuable confirmation. It has demonstrated that, from the first instant, the programme is fixed as to what this living being will be: a man, this individual-man with his characteristic aspects already well determined. Right from fertilization is begun the adventure of a human life, and each of its great capacities requires time . . . to find its place and to be in a position to act.''  [ 25 ]  This teaching remains valid and is further confirmed, if confirmation were needed, by recent findings of human biological science which recognize that in the zygote * resulting from fertilization the biological identity of a new human individual is already constituted. **********Certainly no experimental datum can be in itself sufficient to bring us to the recognition of a spiritual soul; nevertheless, the conclusions of science regarding the human embryo provide a valuable indication for discerning by the use of reason a personal presence at the moment of the first appearance of a human life: how could a human individual not be a human person? The Magisterium has not expressly committed itself to an affirmation of a philosophical nature, but it constantly reaffirms the moral condemnation of any kind of procured abortion. This teaching has not been changed and is unchangeable.  [ 26 ] **********Thus the fruit of human generation, from the first moment of its existence, that is to say from the moment the zygote has formed, demands the unconditional respect that is morally due to the human being in his bodily and spiritual totality. The human being is to be respected and treated as a person from the moment of conception; and therefore from that same moment his rights as a person must be recognized, among which in the first place is the inviolable right of every innocent human being to life. **********This doctrinal reminder provides the fundamental criterion for the solution of the various problems posed by the development of the biomedical sciences in this field: since the embryo must be treated as a person, it must also be defended in its integrity, tended and cared for, to the extent possible, in the same way as any other human being as far as medical assistance is concerned.  2. Is Prenatal Diagnosis Morally Licit? **********If prenatal diagnosis respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed towards its safeguarding or healing as an individual, then the answer is affirmative. **********For prenatal diagnosis makes it possible to know the condition of the embryo and of the fetus when still in the mother's womb. It permits, or makes it possible to anticipate earlier and more effectively, certain therapeutic, medical or surgical procedures. **********Such diagnosis is permissible, with the consent of the parents after they have been adequately informed, if the methods employed safeguard the life and integrity of the embryo and the mother, without subjecting them to disproportionate risks.  [ 27 ]  But this diagnosis is gravely opposed to the moral law when it is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion depending upon the results: a diagnosis which shows the existence of a malformation or a hereditary illness must not be the equivalent of a death-sentence. Thus a woman would be committing a gravely illicit act if she were to request such a diagnosis with the deliberate intention of having an abortion should the results confirm the existence of a malformation or abnormality. The spouse or relatives or anyone else would similarly be acting in a manner contrary to the moral law if they were to counsel or impose such a diagnostic procedure on the expectant mother with the same intention of possibly proceeding to an abortion. So too the specialist would be guilty of illicit collaboration if, in conducting the diagnosis and in communicating its results, he were deliberately to contribute to establishing or favoring a link between prenatal diagnosis and abortion. **********In conclusion, any directive or program of the civil and health authorities or of scientific organizations which in any way were to favor a link between prenatal diagnosis and abortion, or which were to go as far as directly to induce expectant mothers to submit to prenatal diagnosis planned for the purpose of eliminating fetuses which are affected by malformations or which are carriers of hereditary illness, is to be condemned as a violation of the unborn child's right to life and as an abuse of the prior rights and duties of the spouses.  3. Are Therapeutic Procedures Carried Out on the Human Embryo Licit? **********As with all medical interventions on patients, one must uphold as licit procedures carried out on the human embryo which respect the life and integrity of the embryo and do not involve disproportionate risks for it but are directed towards its healing, the improvement of its condition of health, or its individual survival. **********Whatever the type of medical, surgical or other therapy, the free and informed consent of the parents is required, according to the deontological rules followed in the case of children. The application of this moral principle may call for delicate and particular precautions in the case of embryonic or fetal life. **********The legitimacy and criteria of such procedures have been clearly stated by Pope John Paul II: ''A strictly therapeutic intervention whose explicit objective is the healing of various maladies such as those stemming from chromosomal defects will, in principle, be considered desirable, provided it is directed to the true promotion of the personal well-being of the individual without doing harm to his integrity or worsening his conditions of life. Such an intervention would indeed fall within the logic of the Christian moral tradition.''  [ 28 ] 4. How Is One to Evaluate Morally Research and Experimentation* on Human Embryos and Fetuses? **********Medical research must refrain from operations on live embryos, unless there is a moral certainty of not causing harm to the life or integrity of the unborn child and the mother, and on condition that the parents have given their free and informed consent to the procedure. It follows that all research, even when limited to the simple observation of the embryo, would become illicit were it to involve risk to the embryo's physical integrity or life by reason of the methods used or the effects induced. **********As regards experimentation, and presupposing the general distinction between experimentation for purposes which are not directly therapeutic and experimentation which is clearly therapeutic for the subject himself, in the case in point one must also distinguish between experimentation carried out on embryos which are still alive and experimentation carried out on embryos which are dead. If the embryos are living, whether viable or not, they must be respcted just like any other human person; experimentation on embryos which is not directly therapeutic is illicit.  [ 29 ] **********No objective, even though noble in itself, such as a foreseeable advantage to science, to other human beings or to society, can in any way justify experimentation on living human embryos or fetuses, whether viable or not, either inside or outside the mother's womb. The informed consent ordinarily required for clinical experimentation on adults cannot be granted by the parents, who may not freely dispose of the physical integrity or life of the unborn child. Moreover, experimentation on embryos and fetuses always involves risk, and indeed in most cases it involves the certain expectation of harm to their physical integrity or even their death. **********To use human embryos or fetuses as the object or instrument of experimentation constitutes a crime against their dignity as humman beings having a right to the same respect that is due to the child already born and to every human person. **********The Charter of the Rights of the Family published by the Holy See affirms: ''Respect for the dignity of the human being excludes all experimental manipulation or exploitation of the human embryo.''  [ 30 ]  The practice of keeping alive human embryos in vivo or in vitro for experimental or commercial purposes is totally opposed to human dignity. **********In the case of experimentation that is clearly therapeutic, namely, when it is a matter of experimental forms of therapy used for the benefit of the embryo itself in a final attempt to save its life, and in the absence of other reliable forms of therapy, recourse to drugs or procedures not yet fully tested can be licit.  [ 31 ] **********The corpses of human embryos and fetuses, whether they have been deliberately aborted or not, must be respected just as the remains of other human beings. In particular, they cannot be subjected to mutilation or to autopsies if their death has not yet been verified and without the consent of the parents or of the mother. Furthermore, the moral requirements must be safeguarded that there be no complicity in deliberate abortion and that the risk of scandal be avoided. Also, in the case of dead fetuses, as for the corpses of adult persons, all commerical trafficking must be considered illicit and should be prohibited.  5. How is one to evaluate morally the use for research purposes of embryos obtained by fertilization 'in vitro'? **********Human embryos obtained in vitro are human beings and subjects with rights: their dignity and right to life must be respected from the first moment of their existence. It is immoral to produce human embryos destined to be exploited as disposable ''biological material.'' **********In the usual practice of in vitro fertilization, not all of the embryos are transferred to the woman's body; some are destroyed. Just as the Church condemns induced abortion, so she also forbids acts against the life of these human beings. It is a duty to condemn the particular gravity of the voluntary destruction of human embryos obtained 'in vitro' for the sole purpose of research, either by means of artifical insemination of by means of ''twin fission.'' By acting in this way the researcher usurps the place of God; and, even though he may be unaware of this, he sets himself up as the master of the destiny of others inasmuch as he arbitrarily chooses whom he will allow to live and whom he will send to death and kills defenseless human beings. **********Methods of observation or experimentation which damage or impose grave and disproportionate risks upon embryos obtained in vitro are morally illicit for the same reasons. Every human being is to be respected for himself, and cannot be reduced in worth to a pure and simple instrument for the advantage of others. It is therefore not in conformity with the moral law deliberately to expose to death human embryos obtained 'in vitro.' In consequence of the fact that they have been produced in vitro, those embryos which are not transferred into the body of the mother and are called ''spare'' are exposed to an absurd fate, with no possibility of their being offered safe means of survival which can be licitly pursued.  6. What judgment should be made on other procedures of manipulating embryos connected with the ''techniques of human reproduction''? **********Techniques of fertilization in vitro can open the way to other forms of biological and genetic manipulation of human embryos, such as attempts or plans for fertilization between human and animal gametes and the gestation of human embryos in the uterus of animals, or the hypothesis or project of constructing artificial uteruses for the human embryos. These procedures are contrary to the human dignity proper to the embryo, and at the same time they are contrary to the right of every person to be conceived and to be born within marriage and from marriage.  [ 32 ]  Also, attempts or hypotheses for obtaining a human being without any connection with sexuality through ''twin fission,'' cloning or parthenogenesis are to be considered contrary to the moral law, since they are in opposition to the dignity both of human procreation and of the conjugal union. **********The freezing of embryos, even when carried out in order to preserve the life of an embryo - cryopreservation - constitutes an offence against the respect due to human beings by exposing them to grave risks of death or harm to their physical integrity and depriving them, at least temporarily, of maternal shelter and gestation, thus placing them in a situation in which further offenses and manipulation are possible. **********Certain attempts to influence chromosomic or genetic inheritance are not therapeutic but are aimed at producing human beings selected according to sex or other predetermined qualities. These manipulations are contrary to the personal dignity of the human being and his or her integrity and identity. Therefore in no way can they be justified on the grounds of possible beneficial consequences for future humanity.  [ 33 ]  Every person must be respected for himself: in this consists the dignity and right of every human being from his or her beginning. *********** The zygote is the cell produced when the nuclei of the two gametes have fused. ************ Since the terms ''research'' and ''experimentation'' are often used equivalently and ambiguously, it is deemed necessary to specify the exact meaning given them in this document. **********1) By research is meant any inductive-deductive process which aims at promoting the systematic observation of a given phenomenon in the human field or at verifying a hypothesis arising from previous observations. **********2) By experimentation is meant any research in which the human being (in the various stages of his existence: embryo, fetus, child or adult) represents the object through which or upon which one intends to verify the effect, at present unknown or not sufficiently known, of a given treatment (e.g. pharmacological, teratogenic, surgical, etc.)."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/15/business/finance-briefs-debt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Debt", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS; Debt", "body_text": " **********Fuqua Industries is offering in the Euromarket $75 million of 6 1/2 percent convertible subordinated debentures due in 2002 at a price of 100 through underwriters led by Chemical Bank International Ltd.

But many are recommending individual building and construction-related companies where special factors may push stock prices higher. **********THE recent jump in interest rates did not change Wall Street's opinion of the home building companies - analysts had long since soured on the group. But many are recommending individual building and construction-related companies where special factors may push stock prices higher. **********''Our position is that it is too late in the cycle to be positive on the group,'' said Jonathan Goldfarb, building analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. **********This year's caution comes after years of stellar stock performance by the group. From 1982 through 1986, an index of 15 building stocks climbed fivefold, according to Mr. Goldfarb. But this year, these stocks have lagged behind the market's strong advance. And many have even fallen since interest rates first jumped in March. Rising interest rates hurt the homebuilding market by making mortgages more expensive; they also raise builders' costs. From mid-April through mid-August, the stock of the U.S. Home Corporation was off 27 percent and the Pulte Home Corporation was down 5.4 percent. For the second quarter, the building stocks were the worst-performing sector of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********Professional investors have been selling the shares. ''Portfolio managers are saying, 'I'm not going to fool around being cute, I'm out of them,'' said Barbara T. Alexander, managing director at Salomon Brothers in New York. **********Few on Wall Street expect the home building stocks in general to provide decent relative returns in the next few years. Many, however, such as Laurence H. Hirschhorn, vice president at the First Boston Corporation in New York, are negative on the group, but positive on individual stocks. He said he had ''never had more buy recommendations in my career.'' **********Investors are cautious or even negative about the building stocks because they perceive that the construction and housing cycles are at or past their tops. ''The fundamentals of the industry are now peaking,'' Mr. Goldfarb said. Inflation-adjusted construction spending, he added, rose to 9.1 percent of the gross national product last year from 7.7 percent in 1982. The analyst expects the figure to fall this year and settle near 5 to 6 percent in 1988. **********Home building in the last few years has been quite strong. Every year since 1983 housing starts have totaled more than 1.7 million, the high end of the normal range, First Boston's Mr. Hirschhorn said. A sustained period of above-average construction such as that is ''extraordinary.'' **********Ms. Alexander said that housing starts would suffer this year because of the problem of ''affordability.'' The cost of new homes is up 12 percent in the first half of 1987, prices of existing homes are up 6 percent, consumer income is up only a bit and mortgage rates are up two percentage points since March. These factors, she said, are ''worse than at any time, other than a few years ago, in the last 20 to 25 years.'' **********Despite the affordability problem, most Wall Street analysts are recommending some ''special situation'' stocks. Mr. Hirschhorn, for instance, favors Armstrong World Industries. The company has increased earnings because of the changes made by Joseph L. Jones, chief executive for the last five years. He has cut costs and sharpened Armstrong's focus by measuring employee productivity by contributions to profits, not sales volume. Mr. Hirschhorn expects the company to earn $3.15 to $3.25 a share this year, up from $2.54 last year. **********Mr. Hirschhorn also favors the Sikes Corporation, which makes ceramic floor tiles. Demand for these tiles has doubled in the last decade, he said, in part because ceramic tiles are now used in hallways, kitchens and other rooms besides bathrooms. He expects the company to earn 95 cents a share this year and $1.30 in 1988. **********Analysts consider the Masco Corporation one of the true growth stocks of the building group. The company has enjoyed expanding earnings for 30 consecutive years and has completed several acquisitions of manufacturers of furniture, plumbing products and bathroom and kitchen fixtures. **********Mr. Goldfarb expects the company to earn $1.95 a share this year, up from $1.56 last year. Next year he is looking for $2.30. The stock is selling at a price-earnings multiple roughly equal to the market's; Ms. Alexander thinks it merits a higher one. **********Merrill's Mr. Goldfarb is recommending stocks of five building-related companies: AFG Industries, Masco, Morgan Products Ltd., Payless Cashways Inc. and Stanley Works. **********AFG makes flat glass used for, among other things, windows in new homes. Demand for it this year has been surprisingly strong. And AFG, Mr. Goldfarb said, should outperform other similar companies in growth and profitability. He anticipates annual earnings growth of 30 percent. The stock sold last week at $28 a share. Its earnings multiple is lower than the overall market's and Mr. Goldfarb thinks it should be at a premium. **********Mr. Goldfarb also likes the stocks of two companies involved in home alterations and repair: Morgan Products, which distributes windows and doors, and Stanley Works, which makes tools and equipment for the do-it-yourself crowd. **********Of course, home building stocks are closely tied to interest rates. Investors who think that rates will be lower rather than higher in the next few months might consider betting against the herd, Ms. Alexander said. Because the building stocks have dropped so low, they would rebound sharply if rates fell."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/12/world/intruder-atttacks-2-officers-outside-london-palace.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTRUDER ATTTACKS 2 OFFICERS OUTSIDE LONDON PALACE", "print_headline": "INTRUDER ATTTACKS 2 OFFICERS OUTSIDE LONDON PALACE", "body_text": " **********A man attacked two officers with a knife and hammer in the Kensington Palace garden early today but did not get inside, where the Prince and Princess of Wales and other members of the royal family slept, the police said. **********The masked intruder was tackled and handcuffed before he could breach the wall around the 17th-century red-brick palace in southwest London, Scotland Yard reported.

Increasingly, shoppers who were once content with bananas and oranges are now purchasing fruits they can barely pronounce and never heard of until recently - exotics like the star-shaped carambola, the prickly lychee and the grapefruit-like pummelo. **********Such fruits have been staples for several years in ethnic markets and fancy specialty stores in New York, Chicago and other big cities. Now, however, more and more mainstream retailers - including such giant supermarket chains as Safeway and A.&P. -are beginning to stock them. **********''The turnaround in receptiveness of the average consumer and grocer has been 100 percent in the last five years,'' said Chris Rollins, director of the Fruit and Spice Park in Homestead, Fla., a showcase for locally grown exotica that is operated by Dade County. ''As time goes by, these items get more accepted,'' said Fred DeVries, a consultant at Marketing Standards Inc. in Grandville, Mich. ''The producers are having a tough time filling the demand.'' **********The demand, food experts agree, has been fueled by a number of changes in the American palate. Consumers have become more sophisticated about food and more adventurous. In particular, the experts say, consumers are constantly on the lookout for new ingredients for a healthful diet. **********The growing fascination with exotic fruits comes at a time when retailers are relying more than ever on the produce section of the supermarket, a section that in 1985 contributed an average of 8.2 percent to total store sales and 21 percent to net profits. A way to attract customers, retailers have found, is to keep a wide range of items on the produce shelves. There are 200 items in the average section now, nearly triple the number in the early 1970's, said Nancy Tucker, a nutrition specialist with the Produce Marketing Association, a trade group based in Baltimore. **********Many of the new items are exotics. A typical Safeway store, for example, now carries kiwis, winter melons, Mandarin oranges, persimmons and kumquats, said Felicia DelCampo, a company spokeswoman. **********''We have experimented with a lot of different exotic fruits,'' said Michael Kemp, the produce manager for the Des Moines division of Super Valu Stores Inc., a chain of about 200 supermarkets in Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois. In general, he said, the experiments have paid off. Just a few years ago, he said, ''if we could sell 10 cases of kiwi in a week, that would be a treat. Now we're moving that many a day and better.'' **********''People get tired of eating apples and oranges and bananas all the time,'' Mr. Kemp added.

Merhige Jr. to get the lawyers to fashion a compromise. **********The arguments, and the expert testimony scheduled over the next few days to support them, will form the basis for a ruling by Judge Merhige on whether Robins can proceed with its plan to emerge from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection it sought in August 1985 and be acquired by the Rorer Group Inc. Terms of Reorganization Plan **********Robins's reorganization plan includes the creation of a $1.75 billion trust fund to cover the claims by women injured by its intrauterine device. It also would leave Robins's shareholders with Rorer stock worth $30 a share, or $735 million. **********Critics of the plan say it offers too little protection to those injured by the birth control device and too much to the Robins family, which owns 41 percent of the shares, and other shareholders. ''There's no reason under the law for them to get anything if it jeopardizes the recovery of the victims,'' said one lawyer who was observing the proceedings on behalf of a group of claimants. **********Judge Merhige was optimistic after yesterday's presentations that a solution to the long struggle was at hand. ''I think I see the way to go,'' he said in his chambers during an afternoon break, before sequestering himself for a chat with Blackwell Shelley, a bankruptcy judge who aided in the hearings. Meeting of Lawyers Is Set **********At Judge Merhige's urging, lawyers from the parties are meeting tonight to see whether any progress can be made toward an agreement. **********If Judge Merhige determines that the fund is too small, Robins would not be allowed to submit its plan to its creditors and carry out its sale to Rorer, a company based in Fort Washington, Pa., that would become the nation's sixth-largest non-prescription health care company were the takeover completed. Robins makes a wide variety of health care products including Robitussin cough medicine and Chap Stick lip balm. **********Robins's plan could be amended based on Judge Merhige's findings and the new disclosure statement encompassing it presented for his approval as early as next week. Otherwise, a trustee could be appointed to wind up the company's affairs and distribute whatever funds are available to its creditors, including the Dalkon Shield victims. Either way, however, procedural steps and appeals are expected to delay payment of compensation for at least a year. **********James C. Roberts, Robins's lead counsel, said today that 30,000 women have compensable injuries and that 3,000 others could be expected to assert future claims. Based on settlements and court judgments in earlier cases, the company projected that future claims would range between $698 million and $1.215 billion. Company Estimate Attacked **********That analysis was blasted by John Walsh, a Washington lawyer representing a committee of claimants' lawyers. ''Their evidence is going to be an attempt to rewrite history,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''A capped fund of $1.75 billion simply cannot deal with the effects of this calamity.'' **********Mr. Walsh did not specify in his opening statement the number of women who should receive compensation, but he said that the total amount would run between $4 billion and $7 billion. The estimates by Robins and Mr. Walsh bracketed others offered by attorneys representing Robins's shareholders and creditors and its insurer, the Aetna Casualty and Surety Company. **********Aetna's estimate was especially intriguing to the scores of lawyers who packed the courtroom. John Harkins Jr., Aetna's attorney, said that its experts calculated 90,000 women would be entitled to more than nominal payments, on the theory that they would be able to show a plausible connection between the Dalkon Shield and injuries they had suffered. Insurer's Estimate **********''We see the value ranging between $2 billion and $2.5 billion, depending principally on whether the court will require medical proof of Dalkon Shield use,'' Mr. Harkins said. Some claimants' attorneys noted that Aetna's figure was close to Robins's total value as indicated in the Rorer bid. **********They also noted that such a figure would extract the maximum sum possible for Robins and perhaps limit Aetna's own costs. Aetna is a defendant in many of the Dalkon Shield suits. Some victims have charged that it directed early efforts by Robins to defend itself against claims in the 1970's and in doing so prolonged the exposure of the public to the device. **********Mr. Walsh pounced on Aetna's estimate in his presentation, saying, ''That estimate at the very least establishes a base below which the court should not go.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/29/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 211, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " *********** Acme-Cleveland Corp., Cleveland, a maker of telecommunications products, elected to its board Gerald C.

Gorbachev would succeed. But she said she was optimistic that the Kremlin was no longer guided simply by what she called a strong drive to ''pacify'' the Soviet population. **********''In comparison with the Khrushchev era, much has changed,'' she said. ''There are no longer the dark masses which could be ruled easily, whose minds could be controlled. There are thinking people, who have been educated in how socialism ought to be, and they want it that way.'' **********In the hourlong interview, Miss Zaslavskaya talked about her current project, revising the 50-year-old Stalinist concept of social structure, and shared her views of the current state of the Soviet economy, some of the views startling even by the more liberal standards of Mr. Gorbachev's ''glasnost'' campaign. New Set of Laws Prepared **********She also said a new set of laws intended to set Mr. Gorbachev's initiatives in motion had been completed and was being disseminated among Soviet officials before publication. **********She said she had not yet read the laws in their final form, but she does not expect them to include food price increases, a controversial proposal that she has strongly supported. **********Although she is not a policy maker, Miss Zaslavskaya said she had personal contacts with Mr. Gorbachev, the Communist Party General Secretary, and her opinions are thought to influence the party's economic strategy. **********The soft-spoken Miss Zaslavskaya heads the 50-member Department of Social Problems at the Soviet Academy of Science's economics branch in Novosibirsk. For years, she has been one of the most innovative thinkers in Soviet economics, along with her mentor, Abel Aganbegyan, but her writing was published rarely, and then only in restricted forums. **********Under Mr. Gorbachev, Miss Zaslavskaya has won new public recognition. But she still lives in a shared cottage in Novosibirsk and has little contact with foreigners. Her visit here as part of the official Soviet delegation for the Chautauqua conference is her second trip abroad. 'Some Trouble' in 1983 **********In the interview, Miss Zaslavskaya seemed slightly ill at ease, twisting a tassel from her shawl around her right forefinger as she acknowledged that publication of one of her reports in the West had caused her ''some trouble.'' She was referring to a report she delivered in 1983 to a meeting of economists she organized at her institute. **********''We came to the conclusion that the situation was critical and there was no hope for change under the existing state mechanism,'' she said. ''If you're traveling on an ocean liner, which was going along quickly and then began to lose speed and stopped altogether, there is nothing else to do but go down to the boiler room and find out what's wrong with the engines.'' **********These seem like obvious conclusions, but Miss Zaslavskaya said that they had been ''fairly revolutionary'' for the time and that her work was judged too ''disruptive'' for publication. She said she was shocked when excerpts appeared in Western newspapers five months later. **********''There was a big investigation,'' she said with a small laugh. ''But thanks to the fact that it got out into the West, it was widely read in the U.S.S.R., and all of our leaders read it, too.'' **********Miss Zaslavskaya said she had more hopes for Mr. Gorbachev's changes than those initiated by Khrushchev, who was later deposed. **********''Khrushchev acted in a revolutionary manner, but he was often like a clumsy bear,'' she said. ''The present leadership is not only intelligent, but rational.'' A New Social Model **********One sign of her optimism is a plan to publish by early next year a book that challenges the Stalinist model of the three-class society - peasants, workers and intelligentsia - and seeks to replace it one of her own, which asserts that Soviet power created new social strata not envisioned by classic Marxist-Leninist theory. **********At the top of these ''strata'' - Miss Zaslavskaya will not call them classes - are the bureaucrats who run the Communist Party and Government. Below are the intelligentsia, followed by physical laborers and ''those who cannot be classified simply by where they work.'' **********''These are the pensioners, small nations of the north, the hippies, the vagabonds, people without passports,'' she said, listing groups that are given little attention by the authorities or whose existence is simply not recognized. **********Within those broad strata, she said, she had identified 75 subgroups. **********Arguing in favor of increasing food prices, which are heavily subsidized, Miss Zaslavskaya said subsidies for meat alone cost the Kremlin about $120 billion a year. Subsidies cannot be maintained indefinitely, but price rises must be accompanied by wage increases, she said. **********''There should be dozens of appearances by experts who will explain why this is absolutely necessary, who will explain that all of this will be compensated for,'' she said.

He called the Pershing 2 and ground-launched cruise missiles ''expensive bargaining chips'' that will be withdrawn if the treaty being discussed this week by American and Soviet leaders in Washington comes to fruition. **********Mr. Arkin's figures are based on published budget documents.

Only $254 million more is left to be spent before the production programs end, and this money is probably already pledged to the firms. **********To buy the nuclear explosives, the Department of Energy has spent more than $1 billion for approximately 485 cruise-missile warheads, and $350 million for about 120 maneuvering re-entry vehicles and nuclear warheads used by the Pershing 2. **********The United States spent $628 million for six cruise-missile bases and five Pershing bases.

The program, only two years old, might also have an influence on sentencing practices, some court analysts believe. **********''Right now judges say that often they only have a choice between prison and nothing, but technology can expand those options,'' such as allowing for the sentencing of felons to house arrest or to longer periods of probation, said James K. Stewart, director of the National Institute of Justice, a research arm of the Justice Department. **********The devices, most of which are placed around wrists and ankles, are finding growing acceptance among correction officials. Some critics, however, have voiced constitutional questions about the concept. **********The origin of the electronic monitoring devices was a bit unusual. Judge Jack Love of Albuquerque, N.M., came up with the idea in 1979 after reading an article in the comic strip ''Spiderman,'' in which a villain attached an electronic bracelet to the hero's wrist to track his whereabouts. **********The high-tech skulduggery led Judge Love to discuss the idea with several computer companies, but found no interest. At Honeywell, however, Judge Love, who wanted no stake in any enterprise, met Michael Goss, a marketing representative, who saw merit in the concept. **********Mr. Goss left Honeywell in 1983 and started a company to develop the electronic bracelets. In 1985, BI Inc. of Boulder, Colo,, bought Mr. Goss's company and the first use of the device was made that year for parolees in Michigan. **********Now, more than a dozen companies offer electronic monitoring equipment, which is used by 45 correction agencies, up from 10 last year. Across the country, more than 1,000 parolees, defendants under house arrest or those on probation are being monitored. **********Criminologists expect more jurisdictions to use the systems as officials become more familiar with the technology and as state and local governments, many already under pressure to relieve overcrowded jails, seek alternatives to incarceration. Concern over the spread of AIDS in prisons has also intensified efforts to find alternative sentencing measures for nonviolent offenders. **********The most widely used system is the electronic bracelet or anklet. The offender wears a waterproof, battery-operated transmitter, the size of a pack of cigarettes, which regularly emits an encoded signal. A receiver in the offender's home detects the signal when the transmitter is within 150 feet and reports this information over telephone wires to a so-called host computer in the correctional facility. The information is used to confirm that the offender was at home during specified times. **********Two industry leaders, BI and Correctional Services Inc. in West Palm Beach, Fla., sell host computers for about $15,000. Each host computer can be linked to 200 receivers. The companies also offer transmitters and bands that are tamper-resistant: If they are cut off or damaged, the central computer will alert officials. **********For example, last year Nassau County probation officials, using electronic monitoring devices for nine offenders on probation, discovered through their host computer that one man had not been home on three evenings. He later admitted making nocturnal trips to the home of a woman friend a quarter-mile from his house. This violated his probation and he received a 90-day jail sentence. **********Correction officers hope that the devices will also serve as a constant reminder to the offenders of their arrest, and thus restrain them from breaking the rules of their release. But many believe that the technology is still too new to predict its behaviorial effect on users. **********However, in a study on electronic monitoring, Joseph B. Vaughn, a research associate at the Criminal Justice Center at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Tex., said, ''In a small number of cases, the monitor has become a symbol, reminding the person continuously of his transgression, and a crutch, providing the person with an excuse not to participate in activities.'' **********Some critics of the program say that such electronic monitoring constitutes oppressive surveillance, and that public officials should move cautiously before adopting the technology. Civil libertarians have raised constitutional questions about the program, but no court challenges have yet been filed. **********Other critics question the reliability of the devices. Most of the systems use the telephone exchanges, some of which are not sophisticated enough for the monitors. **********For example, some exchanges use modern switching equipment and can handle pulses emitted from the Touch-Tone telephones used in the monitoring program, while others use older equipment and could have trouble transmitting the electronic signals. **********Another potential problem is the effect of some large metal appliances in the home, which may block signal transmission or create an electromagnet field. This can also occur in steel trailers or in stucco houses. **********But advocates of electronic monitoring contend that the technology is vital to help overworked parole and probation officers, many of whom individually monitor 300 people. According to the Department of Justice, 70 percent of convicted felons are released on probation, and 1.9 million people currently live outside of prison under some form of supervision. **********Some entrepreneurs, who say the transmitters are stigmas - like electronic scarlet letters - have developed monitors to track offenders without attaching devices to their bodies. **********One system relies on computerized voice identification. At the beginning of the supervision period, a computer makes a record of the offender's voice. To insure that the offender is at a designated location, the computer is programmed to call the person at a specified time and request that a series of phrases be repeated. They are then matched with the earlier recording. Vox Tron Systems Inc., in New Braunfels, Tex., has been selling voice-identification computers since the end of last year. **********Another system uses visual verification. Since last November, Luma Telecom Inc., a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Electric Sales America Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., has sold telephone units that transmit black-and-white still pictures of the callers on a three-inch diagonal screen. The company says the system provides a more personal touch by permitting the offender and official to see each other. **********Other companies are trying to enter the market with products that serve two functions. Behavioral Systems Southwest of Pomona, Calif., is developing a wristwatch that has an algorithm function to generate a four-digit code number. A host computer will call the offender and instruct that the time and code number on the watch be entered into the computer by pressing the corresponding numbers on a Touch-Tone phone. The code numbers, which change every minute, have been synchronized with the computer. ''Everytime the telephone rings, the person will think he's being checked on, even if he's not,'' said Ted Nissen, the company's president. **********And Mr. Nissen has not forgotten fashion - black watches for men, white for women."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/03/business/volcker-fears-inflation-if-dollar-keeps-falling.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 689, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VOLCKER FEARS INFLATION IF DOLLAR KEEPS FALLING", "print_headline": "VOLCKER FEARS INFLATION IF DOLLAR KEEPS FALLING", "body_text": " **********The Federal Reserve Board chairman, Paul A. Volcker, warned today that the dollar's decline in currency markets was approaching worrisome levels that threatened a revival of inflation and a rise in interest rates. **********Although Mr. Volcker stopped short of asserting that additional depreciation of the dollar would be entirely unwelcome, he did appear to counsel the Reagan Administration against efforts to ''talk'' the dollar down to spur world growth and thereby narrow the country's record trade deficit. **********''A declining dollar at some point has high costs and risks,'' Mr. Volcker told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. ''It generates inflationary pressures.'' Moreover, he added, ''Uncertainties about the future direction of currency values could dampen the willingness of others to place or maintain funds in the United States - funds upon which, for the time being, we are utterly dependent'' to finance much of the deficit in the Federal budget. Mr. Volcker's views, well known in the credit markets, did not have much impact there, although Treasury notes and bonds fell by as much as 3/8 point.  [ Page D21. ]  Increased Risk of Inflation In response to questions, the Fed chief said that while nobody could tell at what particular point a fall in the dollar was no longer benign, the risks of inflation had clearly increased because of the higher prices of imported goods. ''We are at more dangerous point now,'' Mr. Volcker declared. **********In an appearance lasting more than two hours, Mr. Volcker also made these points: *********** The ''buoyancy'' of financial markets these days should be used to strengthen balance sheets and not be dissipated in ''excessive leveraging and financial risk-taking.'' *********** The trade deficit, which fell sharply in December, seems to have ended its deterioration, ''but signs that the corner has been turned are not yet decisive.'' *********** There is evidence of a developing ''impasse'' over third world debt. *********** Taiwan was a particular culprit on trade. He said that it maintains restrictive import practices that are ''certainly not appropriate today.'' **********As he has done on numerous occasions, Mr. Volcker emphasized the importance of reducing the American budget deficit, which is closely tied to the trade deficit, because foreigners would not be able to buy Treasury securities without the money they obtain by selling their goods in this country. **********He also renewed the American call for West Germany and Japan to spur their economies so they consume more of both their goods and ours. **********When the committee's chairman, Paul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, suggested that these countries might have already done enough, by cutting their central-bank lending rates, Mr. Volcker said he worried ''that their growth momentum is in danger of being too little, rather than too much.'' Impact of Weak Dollar **********But it was the weak dollar and its implications for renewed inflation that seemed of equal concern to Mr. Volcker today. Although he said he did not see any immediate inflationary threat - in fact, he referred to ''a sense of cumulating movements toward price stability'' in the manufacturing sector - he noted that there were real risks of an eventual surge in the price level. **********''My concern is that when you get pressures this year, which are more or less inevitable, from rising import prices and from the higher oil price, if that's maintained'' he said, ''the Consumer Price Index won't look as good.'' He added, ''Can we avoid that feeding back into wage and other cost trends and building in cumulative inflationary pressures?'' **********In a separate development today, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, circulated to colleagues the outline of what he declared a bipartisan comprehensive trade bill that is expected to be introduced as early as this week.

Experts say the reason is that neither Iran nor Iraq can afford frequent use of the expensive munitions needed to destroy large tankers. **********Despite the battering inflicted on gulf shipping by machine-gun fire, small cannon and rockets, crew casualties have been comparatively light, and most damage has been easily repaired. **********A Defense Department spokesman said intelligence officials had been unable in most cases to determine which missiles were used in the attacks. But other military informants noted that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is essentially a guerrilla organization, and that its small boats, armed with light guns and infantry anti-tank missiles, were unsuited to naval warfare except for harassing operations. **********Iran is believed to have about three American-made Harpoon anti-ship missiles, as well as an unknown number of Chinese-made HY-2 (Silkworm) adaptations of the Soviet SS-N-2 Styx anti-ship missile. Iraq is fairly well supplied with Soviet missiles and the potent French-built Exocet AM-39. These missiles are all devastating. The Exocet, for instance, can ram a 400-pound explosive warhead deep inside a ship just above the waterline before exploding. Difficult to Shoot Down **********An anti-ship missile can be launched by an airplane, helicopter, small vessel or shore installation from distances up to about 40 miles from their targets. Flying a few feet above the ocean surface at nearly the speed of sound, they track their targets with radar and are very difficult to evade or shoot down. **********But anti-ship missiles of this class are costly and difficult for the gulf antagonists to acquire. A single Harpoon missile, for instance, costs well over $1 million, and industry experts say the price of an Exocet is probably about $250,000. Moreover, even the battle-tested Exocet - it was the missile used against the American warship Stark in the gulf in May - can easily fail to destroy a large tanker, experts say. **********Naval architects and shipping officials who asked that they not be identified said a typical 1,000-foot tanker was not easy to sink; in some respects, it may be even less vulnerable to attack than a warship. **********The steel plating covering the hull of such a ship varies in thickness from 22 millimeters on the sides to 26 millimeters along the bottom, a little under and a little over one inch, which is ample for stopping most machine-gun bullets. Rockets of any caliber can easily penetrate such plates, but a missile explosion inside a tanker is muffled by the crude oil that fills cargo compartments, and crude oil is unlikely to catch fire, even when exposed to a warhead explosion. **********If a missile should blow a huge hole in a 1,000-foot tanker's hull, the effect, a Coast Guard expert said, would be to flood one of up to 17 cargo compartments. This would merely lower the ship in the water without putting it in danger of sinking. Weapons Relatively Cheap **********But although the use of anti-ship missiles in the Persian Gulf has been rare, attacks using small missiles, including infantry anti-tank rockets, have occurred often. Such missiles can cause extensive damage to a merchant ship's bridge or crew quarters, and the weapons are relatively cheap. An American Light Antitank Weapon (LAW), a shoulder-fired missile, costs $348, and a Soviet equivalent, the ''rocket-propelled grenade,'' is believed to carry a comparable price tag. **********Iran's hit-and-run naval forces are also believed to carry some American missiles with greater ranges and striking power, including the Dragon and the TOW, both wire-guided missiles designed to penetrate tank armor. (The TOW figured in American efforts to bargain for the release of hostages held by Iranian-backed terrorists in Lebanon.) The TOW, with a warhead six inches in diameter, can be fired at targets up to two miles away. **********Industry experts acknowledge that in some cases, tankers could face mortal danger from even small missiles. **********''I'd hate to be on a gasoline tanker if a missile hit an empty compartment,'' one said. Such a compartment, he explained, might contain an explosive mixture of gasoline fumes and air, and even a small missile might set it off. Some gasoline is still being shipped through the gulf, he said, although most tankers transport crude oil. **********Under international law, tankers of more than 40,000 tons net displacement are required to flush oxygen from empty crude oil compartments, thereby eliminating the explosion hazard. This is done by sending exhaust gas from diesel engines, rich in fire-quenching carbon dioxide, into the empty oil tanks. Double Hulls for Liquid Gas **********Tankers carrying liquid petroleum gas, which is very flammable, must be built with double hulls, in which the inner hull is separated from outer hull plating by up to two feet. This separation, experts say, would probably reduce the explosion hazard posed by a missile's impact. **********In common with other ships, tankers are vulnerable to hits on their engine rooms and stern steering machinery. Although these areas are relatively difficult for gunners to hit, they are essential to a ship's operation. **********In any case, operators of oil tankers are profoundly worried by the situation in the gulf. **********''A lot of us have discussed options for strengthening the defenses of tankers against missiles and projectiles,'' one said, ''but in the end, we haven't come up with anything practical. The main consolation is that a tanker is in the danger zone for only two or three days. We all just keep hoping to continue to squeak through.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/22/world/us-praises-soviet-for-war-games-role.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1987-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 667, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Praises Soviet for War Games' Role", "print_headline": "U.S. Praises Soviet for War Games' Role", "body_text": " **********State Department officials praised Soviet officials today for cooperating fully last month with the first ''on demand'' inspection by American military officers of a Soviet military exercise on Soviet territory. **********They said the Russians had promptly complied with the American request to carry out a snap inspection of a Russian military exercise in Byelorussia. **********The request was made under an agreement concluded last year in Stockholm on measures aimed at building trust on military matters between the Soviet bloc and Western countries. **********The officials said United States Army officers were allowed to monitor the exercise closely.

Visit Was a Test Case **********Americans wanted to make sure that the Russians had provided accurate information about the size and scope of the exercise. They also saw the inspection as an important test case of the verification provisions in the accord. **********''We were very keen to do it right the first time to set the right precedent,'' a State Department official said. ''That was achieved.'' **********According to the State Department analysis, which is expected to be made public, the Russians answered the request within 24 hours, as required. **********A team of four American Army officers flew from Stuttgart, West Germany to Minsk in the Soviet Union in an American aircraft along with Soviet navigators. They arrived within 36 hours of the American request, as required by the agreement. At Minsk, the American team was met by two Soviet generals and translators. A U.S. Request Is Met **********One difference about how to carry out the inspection was settled in favor of the Americans at the very start. In seeking the inspection, the United States had requested the use of two Soviet helicopters to monitor the military exercise. In its official response to the American request, the Soviet Union had offered one helicopter. **********But in Minsk, the American team insisted on two helicopters, as well as vehicles, and that request was met. **********In the Soviet exercise, one tank division simulated an attack from the south. A motorized infantry division defended against that attack. **********The Americans were allowed to use maps, cameras, binoculars and tape recorders. ''The team walked tank lines, visited units and photographed equipment and personnel without interference,'' the State Department analysis said. **********The Americans were not allowed to enter or fly over some sensitive facilities in the area. But this was in keeping with the terms of the agreement. **********The Americans determined that the Russians had complied with the pact. **********Specifically, the Americans determined that the Russian exercise was not larger than forecast by Moscow. Had the exercise involved 17,000 troops, Moscow would have been obliged to invite Western observers, which Moscow had not done.

As in the case of Elle, the French editorial material will be made available to Murdoch Magazines, which will use what it considers relevant. **********John B. Evans, president of the Murdoch organization, estimates that 60 percent of the French content will be used over here. But that is all up to the editor, Susan Lyne, who was in the movie business before serving as managing editor at both New Times and The Village Voice. **********Mr. Evans envisions the magazine as a Rolling Stone for motion-picture fans, tapping into the same kind of passion for movies that Rolling Stone does for music. It will certainly not be a fan magazine, he said, but rather a celebration of the craft. And all of the material used from the French side will deal with American movies. **********The first issue of the American monthly is due out in June, with 300,000 copies to be put on newsstands. A four-color page will go for $8,550 and black-and-white for $6,250. **********Initially, all circulation will come from single-copy sales (at $1.95 each) because of the difficulty of getting good lists of subscription prospects. Subscription lists will have to be built slowly though bingo cards in the magazine, publicity and promotion. **********With so many affluent young adults taking films and their directors so seriously these days, it's no wonder that publishers see great possibilities for an advertising medium. **********Back in 1972, Time Inc. examined the possibilities of such a publication at the same time it was considering a magazine on personal finance and two other publications. It went with Money. **********The category's worst recent failure involved The Movies, a publication that deserved better. It was brought out in 1983 after three years of effort by Joe Armstrong, former publisher of New York, New West and Rolling Stone. It died after five issues, because its Texas angel declined to go beyond his initial $2.5 million investment. Ironically, Mr. Armstrong failed to get additional capital from Daniel Filipacchi of Hachette. **********Another attempt was made in 1979 by Alyse M. Kobin and Andrew Fox, whose magazine was also called Premiere and was distributed free at New York theaters for three issues. The business was then sold and the name was changed to In Cinema. It lasted about two more years, according to Ms. Kobin. Too little advertising, she understood. **********In 1982 Chelsea House Publishers put out Coming Attractions, which lasted for more than a year until lack of advertising pulled down its curtain. **********Mr. Evans of Murdoch said that Premiere would not have a publisher or an ad director and that those functions, as well as others on the business side, would be handled by Carolyn Wall, executive vice president of the Murdoch unit, and Joseph Cece, director of magazine development. **********The American version of Elle was started in the fall of 1985. In its first 12 months it carried 1,082 advertising pages, according to Mr. Evans, who said that the April issue had closed and that the first four months have 602 ad pages, with April alone carrying more than 190, which is 50 pages more than expected.

Gerasimov, said that the Soviet Union had pardoned 140 prisoners serving time for political crimes, and that a similar number of cases were being reviewed. **********The prisoner release was mentioned in the Soviet press for the first time this morning, in a single paragraph at the end of a brief report in the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda. **********There were varying explanations today of why the crackdown had come after a period of apparent domestic change that began with the release of Andrei D. Sakharov from internal exile in the city of Gorky in December. **********One possibility was that Soviet officials had decided to draw a clear line between criticism directed to an audience of Westerners or intellectuals and open displays that would seem to show a slackening of authority. **********Others suggested that the crackdown was intended to pacify forces in the leadership, including police and security officials, who are unhappy about the increased tolerance of dissent. **********Mr. Gerasimov said the plainclothesmen who attacked the demonstrators at the Arbat, the pedestrian mall, were ''vigilantes'' operating without official approval. But a Western reporter who followed two dozen of the men after the violence today watched them board a bus with militia license plates. **********The American Ambassador, Arthur A. Hartman, said today that the crackdown was a case of the authorities reverting to form. **********''What's remarkable here is that the first day's demonstration was permitted,'' he said in an interview, referring to a demonstration Monday that was not disrupted. The violence later, he said ''is just the way those authorities carry out their normal duties.'' **********Mr. Begun is one of several prisoners who has refused to sign the statement demanded by the authorities, according to Western human rights groups.

Nasdaq said it will name a committee this week to look for a new president. **********At a news conference in New York, William R. Hambrecht, the founder of Hambrecht & Quist, said Mr. Macklin will begin work in San Francisco in July and will participate in virtually all of the firm's businesses - sales and trading, underwriting, venture capital and asset management. Hambrecht & Quist, a specialist in the financing of emerging companies, fell on hard times two years ago because of the downturn in high technology. **********Mr. Macklin is among the best-known names in the securities field. In addition to being the paid head of the N.A.S.D., Wall Street's self-regulatory body, Mr. Macklin was for 20 years a senior executive of McDonald & Company, the big investment firm based in Cleveland. **********Mr. Macklin was the principal force behind Nasdaq, the acronym for the N.A.S.D.'s automatic quotation system. Created 17 years ago, shortly after Mr. Macklin's arrival at the N.A.S.D., Nasdaq is a computerized information system that permits competing dealers in over-the-counter stocks to display on computer screens around the country the shares they are offering for sale and the bids they are seeking. It allows investors to execute trades in little-known stocks with the press of a button. **********With more than 150,000 computer terminals tied to the Nasdaq system, the over-the-counter market has become the third largest in the world, after the New York and American stock exchanges. **********''Nasdaq was a major technological advance in information transfer,'' said Stephen Figlewski, a professor of finance at New York University. ''Before Nasdaq, trying to find out who was making markets in which stocks and at what price was difficult.'' **********Indeed, some securities experts believe that the Nasdaq allowed the over-the-counter market to come of age, competing directly with the New York and other physical exchanges for companies and investors.

Equal to about one-third of the volume on the Big Board in 1976, Nasdaq volume has recently been about 80 percent of New York Stock Exchange daily volume, according to the N.A.S.D. **********Mr. Macklin's latest project has been to take Nasdaq international, forming what he and others have called a global trading system. Last April, for example, the London Stock Exchange undertook an experiment with Nasdaq in which 200 stocks were traded on both Nasdaq and the British exchange's automated system. The next step?

It comes at a time when the United States Navy is preparing its first escort of Kuwaiti tankers, reregistered under the American flag, into the gulf sometime next week. **********The United States signed an agreement with Iraq Tuesday with procedures designed to avoid military incidents such as the Iraqi air attack on the United States frigate Stark in mid-May, which killed 37 crewmen. Shipping Routed Around Mines **********The mines were found moored in international waters in the busy Al Ahmadi channel. Kuwait has declared a 10-mile exclusion zone around the mines and is rerouting shipping. **********Defense Department sources say the mines, which are assumed to have been placed in the channel by Iranians, are more a nuisance than a threat, but they cannot be ignored. **********Kuwait has supported Iraq against Iran and Iran's forces have frequently attacked ships bound for Kuwait. **********Four ships have struck mines in the gulf since mid-May but none have sunk. It was thought at first that some of the mines were free floating, dropped by the Iranians, or perhaps that they had broken loose elsewhere. Iran Has No Minelaying Ships **********It is not known when or how the mines were placed. Iran does not have special minelaying ships, but it does have speedboats that have been operating in the upper gulf. Pentagon officials would not speculate if these were used. **********A 19-member team of mine specialists based at Charleston, S. C. - in the Persian Gulf to study the mine threat - discovered the mines. **********Measures can be taken to neutralize or destroy them but it is uncertain whether this has been done. A Pentagon official said he believed the mines had been destroyed, but a Navy officer said they were still in place, with their sites marked to warn ships. **********The Pentagon said another nine-man team of mine specialists from Little Creek, Va., was on the way to the gulf. The new team has advanced sonar devices that provide easier and more accurate identification and location of mines or other obstacles. **********A Pentagon spokesman indicated that 30 miles of the Al Ahmadi channel needs to be surveyed and swept if additional mines were found. Old Soviet-Design Mines **********The mines have been described by a Pentagon spokesman as MO-8 moored contact mines, which can be planted to a depth of 350 feet. The mine, which holds 250 pounds of explosives, is an old Soviet design turned over to North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War. **********The North Koreans have manufactured their own version of the mine, and those found in the gulf are said to be of North Korean manufacture. **********Mine experts consider the MO-8 to be primitive. Unlike modern mines, which can be activated by a variety of means such as sound, pressure or disruption of a magnetic field, the Korean mine can only be detonated by contact with an object, such as a ship. **********Experts here said that, if needed, the United States could deploy specially equipped mine-sweeping helicopters to help deal with the mine threat, as was done three years ago when mines were found in the Red Sea. **********According to these sources, five MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters are available to go to the gulf. Such helicopters, however, are considered more suited for sweeping advanced mines rather than the moored contact type found off Kuwait. **********The use of American crews and equipment may not be necessary, as Kuwait is reported to have asked Saudi Arabia for assistance in mine sweeping. **********The Netherlands is also reported to have offered to assist. Kuwait is believed to be considering the purchase or lease of European mine sweepers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/27/business/company-news-earnings-net-rises-for-oil-companies.html": {"writer_name": "Matthew Wald", "pub_date": "1987-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1033, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Net Rises for Oil Companies", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS: EARNINGS; Net Rises for Oil Companies", "body_text": " **********Leading oil companies reported sharply higher earnings from exploration and production operations in the third quarter compared with the depressed levels of a year ago, after a rise of nearly 40 percent in crude oil prices since then. **********But this was tempered by lower results in refining and marketing operations. Consequently, companies with major refining and marketing operations like the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation found the third quarter a continuation of a difficult year. Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, reported yesterday that third-quarter net income was up only slightly, because of markedly lower profits in refining and marketing, and Mobil showed a slight decline in the third quarter after taking into account a one-time loss last year. **********The Shell Oil Company, the Atlantic Richfield Company, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Unocal Corporation and the Pennzoil Company all reported higher profits.  Exxon **********Exxon said its third-quarter net was $1.065 billion, up 1 percent from $1.055 billion a year earlier, or 75 cents a share compared with 73 cents. For the first nine months, profit was down 15 percent, to $3.28 billion, from $3.88 billion, or from $2.68 per share in 1986 to $2.31. **********The decline in profit over the first nine months would have been sharper if the company had not cut back on capital and exploration expenditures, which were $4.2 billion this year, down 25 percent from the comparable period in 1986. But capital spending was up in the third quarter over the same quarter last year. **********Third-quarter revenues were $21.9 billion, up 27 percent from $17.2 billion. **********In a statement, L. G. Rawl, Exxon's chairman, said, ''Refined product margins continued to be depressed, as product price increases have not kept pace with higher crude costs.'' Crude oil prices averaged $6.50 a barrel higher in the third quarter of this year than last, he said, resulting in higher earnings from exploration and production operations. **********The company reported third-quarter profits from domestic refining and marketing operations of a scant $7 million, down from $106 million a year ago. For foreign operations, the third-quarter net was $53 million, down from $357 million. **********Many companies have suffered from crude oil prices rising faster than product prices, analysts said. Dillard Spriggs, of Petroleum Analysis Ltd., said: ''Downstream margins have been very niggardly for all companies. The exploration and production business is doing well, the chemical business is doing well compared with last year, but refining and marketing is down from last year.''  Shell **********Shell's net more than tripled, to $420 million, from $133 million. Revenues rose 41 percent, to $5.65 billion, from $4.01 billion. **********''Major factors in the improvement were a partial recovery of crude oil prices from a seven-year low, and a record performance in our chemical business,'' said the company president, John F. Bookout. Net income for the quarter from oil and gas exploration and production rose more than ten-fold, to $262 million, from $25 million a year earlier. **********Production costs were lower in the first half, Shell said, but profit margins on refined products fell, as did natural gas prices. **********''We are pleased with our strong third-quarter performance, but the substantial improvement only appears dramatic when contrasted with the severely depressed third quarter of 1986,'' Mr. Bookout said. **********The company is owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.  Mobil **********Mobil said its third-quarter earnings were $319 million, up 75 percent from $182 million a year earlier, or 77 cents a share, compared with 45 cents a share. But results last year were pushed down $150 million by a loss on the sale of the Container Corporation of America; excluding that transaction, Mobil's results were 4 percent behind the year-ago period. **********Revenues were $14.4 billion, up 27 percent from $11.3 billion a year earlier. **********Allan E. Murray, Mobil's chairman, noted that exploration and production results had risen because of higher prices for crude oil and higher natural gas production, but refining and marketing profits fell.  Occidental Petroleum **********Occidental Petroleum, which is not heavily engaged in marketing and refining, reported third-quarter earnings of $46 million, or 20 cents per share, up 18 percent from $39 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 14 percent to $4.2 billion from $3.7 billion. **********Boosted by higher crude oil prices, earnings for the company's oil and gas division were $58 million, compared with a loss of $3 million a year earlier.  ARCO **********ARCO reported that third-quarter earnings more than tripled, to $315 million, or $1.71 a share, from $102 million, or 56 cents a share. Sales rose 25 percent, to $4.4 billion, from $3.53 billion. **********Lodwrick M. Cook, chairman and chief executive, cited the same factors. ''Crude oil prices were higher in the third quarter compared with a year ago, leading to significantly improved results from our oil and gas operations,'' he said. ''Results also benefited from higher earnings from Arco Chemical Company and higher crude oil and natural gas liquids production. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from refining and marketing operations.'' **********Gas and oil exploration and production net rose to $235 million, from $41 million in the same period last year. Earnings for refining and marketing dropped to $30 million, from $94 million.  Unocal **********Unocal reported third-quarter net income of $28.9 million, or 25 cents a share, up 33 percent from $21.8 million, or 19 cents a share. Revenue totaled $2.58 billion, up 35 percent from $1.91 billion.  Pennzoil **********Pennzoil had net income of $2.8 million, with no earnings per share after payment of preferred dividends, compared with a loss of $10.1 million a year earlier. But Pennzoil's year-earlier earnings had included a $23.1 million charge; excluding that, the company would have made a profit of $13 million in that period.

In different settings and for reasons that could hardly have had less in common, a group of Crimean Tatars seeking to redress grievances and the audience at a Billy Joel concert threw away the rule book that has governed public activities in the Soviet Union for decades. **********Together, the Crimean Tatars and rock fans pushed Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for ''glasnost,'' or ''openness,'' to a point that clearly left the authorities anxious. It seemed to amaze the participants themselves. **********The Tatars, who want to regain the Crimean homeland from which they were exiled by Stalin in 1944, marched noisily outside the Kremlin for more than 24 hours over the weekend. **********A few months ago it would have been almost inconceivable for a human rights protest to occur in the heart of the capital without the participants' being quickly whisked away by the police. **********In this case, the demonstration ended when the Crimean Tatars were promised they could meet with President Andrei A. Gromyko on Monday. A few days earlier, Mr. Gromyko had been named to head a commission to examine the Tatar's complaints. **********After they met with Mr. Gromyko, Tatar delegates expressed disappointment over what they said was a failure by the Government to guarantee a sympathetic inquiry into their case. Russians Danced in the Aisles **********At the rock concert, held Sunday night at the Olympic Stadium, thousands of people, energized by the presence and music of Billy Joel, bolted from their seats an hour into the performance and started dancing in the aisles and pressing around the stage. **********Many of the people there said they had never witnessed, much less taken part in, such a breakdown in the normal decorum at a public performance. The scene was repeated Monday night.  Following a series of less disruptive demonstrations in recent months in Moscow and Leningrad by unrelated groups, the latest events suggested that both citizens and the Government were feeling their way toward unexplored territory, unsure how far they could go. **********One indication of the uncertainty was the reaction of Soviet concert organizers, who first upbraided Mr. Joel's associates for letting things get out of control, then later assured the Americans everything was O.K. Audience Breaks Out of Trance **********As the people in the audience, who sat almost motionless through the first part of the concert, broke out of the trance that seems to affect Soviet spectators at public events, many people looked around in astonishment at the scene and their own role in it. **********Although such behavior at rock concerts would be routine in the West, spontaneous behavior at public events is absent in the Soviet Union. What made the behavior all the more striking was that many of those dancing and gesticulating wildly were people in their 30's and 40's, who normally would be likely to condemn such conduct. **********It was as if emotions and energy that had been pent up for years were suddenly released. **********News of the Crimean Tatar protest and the raucous behavior at the concerts, although not reported in the Soviet press or on television, was widely known around Moscow in hours. **********Tass reported on Mr. Joel's tour and his first concert in a terse, four-paragraph dispatch. ''His first performance was a great success,'' it said, giving no further description. Ambivalence Toward Tatars, Too **********In the case of the Tatars, too, there was evidence of ambivalence. **********The appointment of the commission was a major concession, as well as the first time the Government had announced an official public inquiry into decisions by Stalin. **********Since Mr. Gorbachev took office in 1985, there has been a revival of the effort begun under Nikita S. Khrushchev in the mid-1950's to question Stalinism. **********Stalin ordered the deportation of the 200,000 to 250,000 Tatars from the Crimea to Central Asia in 1944, after the German Army had been pushed back. The charge was that the Tatars had collaborated with the Germans. **********Saturday, when the 300 demonstrators gathered near the Kremlin Wall, they tried to march around St. Basil's Cathedral and into Red Square but were stopped by the police in a scuffle that in previous years would certainly have developed into violence. Both Sides Sense New Rules **********But this time the Tatars and the police in particular seemed to understand that they were operating under new rules. The encounter ended peacefully. **********Pravda, apparently reflecting party and Government uncertainty about the Tatars, condemned the demonstration but urged no retaliation. **********The Government has moved slowly but steadily toward a more tolerant attitude toward public demonstrations since a series of human rights protests were violently dispersed. **********Since then, Jews seeking to emigrate to Israel have held demonstrations in Moscow and a Russian nationalist organization called Pamyat, or Memory, was allowed to march near the Kremlin in May. The group, which some critics feel is xenophobic with anti-Semitic overtones, has met with Boris N. Yeltsin, the Moscow party leader. **********In the spring, there were several public demonstrations in Leningrad's St. Isaac's Square, where people pressed for increased efforts to preserve historic buildings. The leader of the group tried to become a candidate for the Leningrad City Soviet, the equivalent of City Council. **********Where the Government will draw the line in all this is unclear. Mr. Gorbachev, responding to the fear of Russians who see spiraling disorder, assured them in February, ''Democracy is not the antithesis of order.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/01/business/market-place-adviser-picks-no-load-funds.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1987-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 871, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Adviser Picks No-Load Funds", "print_headline": "Market Place; Adviser Picks No-Load Funds", "body_text": " **********MONEY managers typically pick stocks or bonds for their client portfolios. But Brouwer & Janachowski, an investment advisory firm in San Francisco, invests in no-load mutual funds for the most part in managing money for its clients. **********''We analyze mutual funds much the same way other professional investors analyze securities,'' Kurt Brouwer, one of the founding partners, said. ''We visit the funds, we talk to their personnel and, in effect, kick the tires. Back in the office, we do comparative computer studies on all types of funds, looking at management performance, portfolio volatility, risk measurements and other factors.'' **********''Managing money with mutual funds allows us to utilize the top investment brains in the business,'' he added. ''Furthermore, no-loads provide us with immediate portfolio diversification and the ability to rifle in on a specialized area.'' **********Mr. Brouwer and his partner, Stephen Janachowski, are sold on the fund concept of investment management, and their particular vehicles are no-load funds, which do not burden shareowners with sales charges. The firm manages $90 million, mostly for wealthy individuals, private businesses and several San Francisco area law firms. Its stated goal is ''to do reasonably well in up markets and to preserve capital in down markets.'' **********The firm says it believes in a ''balanced'' investment approach using equity funds and bond funds, along with money market funds for the cash portion of an account. ''At present, we are more conservative than we have been at any time within the last three years,'' Mr. Brouwer said. ''In fact, for a new account, we might keep as much as 50 percent in money market funds. For individual clients, we also have been buying some municipal bond funds offered by Benham Capital Management.'' **********Examples of no-load equity funds used by the firm are the Partners Fund, with Neuberger & Berman Management as its investment adviser, and the Evergreen Total Return Fund, advised by Saxon Woods Asset Management. **********Mr. Brouwer gave some statistics to illustrate why both funds, in his view, represented a sound investment approach. For the five years ended last March 31, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index showed a total return - market appreciation plus reinvested dividends - averaging 26.3 percent annually. Comparative results were average annual returns of 24.4 percent for Partners and 27.8 percent for Evergreen. **********''But look at their results when the stock market experienced a down quarter, such as occurred in the third quarter of 1986,'' Mr. Brouwer said. ''The S.&P. 500 was down 7 percent, while Partners was off 5.9 percent and Evergreen was down just under 1 percent. Furthermore, during the latest five-year period, both funds displayed a lower volatility than the broad market index - and that's something we like to see.'' **********Brouwer & Janachowski has also used the Mutual Shares Corporation, managed by the Heine Securities Corporation, for equity investments. This fund is temporarily closed for sales, but it, too, has carved out an enviable record. For the five years ended with the first quarter of 1987, Mutual Shares had an average annual return of 26.3 percent - exactly the same as the S.&P. 500 - but its volatility reading was lower. And in last year's third quarter, it outperformed the broad index with a decline of 2.6 percent. The fund's specialty is investing in various forms of corporate restructuring. **********No-load funds are far from becoming an extinct species - an estimated 350 ''pure'' no-loads are in business - but the trend increasingly has been for many mutual funds to exact some form of sales charge. This may take the form of a front-end load of perhaps 4.75 percent, or a redemption charge imposed if the shareholder cashes in before a specified period, usually five or six years. **********''I think that, if portfolio managers of a load fund provide good results for their shareholders, you can justify a sales charge,'' Mr. Brouwer said. ''But all too often the customer is faced with buying a load fund that a brokerage firm happens to be pushing at the time - and somehow the broker is apt to soft-pedal any inherent risks in the fund.'' **********Both Mr. Brouwer and Mr. Janachowski started out as account executives at Merrill Lynch and later worked for Boettcher & Company in Denver. Prior to setting up their partnership in mid-1985, they were affiliated with Birr, Wilson & Company in San Francisco. Since they opened up shop, a typical balanced account shows an average annual return of 27.7 percent, compared with 31.1 percent for the S.&P. 500, an index that is solely in equities. **********Mr. Brouwer has some opinions on the art of investing that apply to individuals as well as money managers. ''I think it is wrong to try to time the market,'' he said. And, putting his practice into words, he is writing an investment book for people who make their own market decisions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/20/business/business-people-official-to-leave-at-t.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1987-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 426, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Official To Leave A.T.&T.", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Official To Leave A.T.&T.", "body_text": " **********James D.

For several months industry officials and analysts have shared the view that little meaningful improvement was likely this year, and the March figures reinforced that view.

Linkage to Refugee Issue **********Pakistani officials said also that if there was no acceptance of the Government by the Afghan guerrillas, three million Afghan refugees in Pakistan may not be willing to return to Afghanistan.The officials added that any solution to the Afghan war must enable the refugees to return. **********But Pakistani and other officials familiar with the negotiations said that there have been few, if any, discussions among the parties even on the subject of a possible interim government that would run the country while the Soviets are withdrawing. **********The Pakistan Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, was again in Moscow recently, but a Pakistani official said the issue of the composition of the Kabul Government ''has not really been discussed in any great depth.'' **********Diplomats close to the situation said they doubted whether Soviet leaders have come to the point where they would be willing to jettison the Communist regime as a price for getting out of Afghanistan. **********But some people here who criticize Pakistan's support of the guerrillas disagree. 'Prepared to Ditch Friends' **********For example, Mushahid Hussein Syed, a left-wing journalist who has frequently visited Afghanistan, said it was his impression that the Russians were ''prepared to ditch their Communist friends in Kabul'' and withdraw their troops in less than a year's time. **********Mr. Hussein, until recently editor of The Muslim, an Islamabad-based daily paper, interviewed the leader of the Soviet-backed regime, who is known as Najib, during a trip to Kabul last month but said he saw no explicit indication of this. **********Guerrilla leaders said they would not stop fighting until the Communists were ousted. But Pakistanis fear that even an 18-month Soviet withdrawal, coupled with a cutoff in aid to the guerrillas, would give the Soviet troops enough time to inflict damage on the insurgents. Stockpiled Weapons a Concern **********At the same time, Soviet officials are known to be concerned that the guerrillas have stockpiled enough weapons -some experts said they could fight for two years or more after an aid cutoff -to oust the Kabul regime once Soviet troops get out. **********The Kabul regime and Mr. Najib have embarked on a drive to establish a ''government of national reconciliation'' to withstand an attack by the guerrillas once the Russians leave. **********So far, experts here and in Peshawar, the Pakistani listening post on the Najib's reconciliation efforts have failed, and that no guerrilla leaders of any significance have defected to his camp. **********Pakistani officials said that Kabul would have to be more flexible in sharwould have to be more flexible in sharing power with non-Communists before its ''national reconciliation'' program is taken seriously. They said they would not press the Afghan guerrillas or Afghan refugees to accept the Government. **********But a senior Pakistani official said also that it was Pakistan's desire to allow to withdrawal without having the Communist regime be overthrown. ''We are quite clear that there has to be an honorable peace,'' said the official. **********''A superpower is not going to be humiliated in Afghanistan,'' he continued. ''Afghanistan in the future should also not become the kind of a base that in any way threatens Soviet security.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/27/world/sri-lanka-emergency-stays.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sri Lanka Emergency Stays", "print_headline": "Sri Lanka Emergency Stays", "body_text": " **********Sri Lanka's Parliament voted today to extend the state of emergency for a further month as Indian troops continued their drive to disarm Tamil guerrillas in northern and eastern areas.

Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, said today that the company had acted in a way that was ''dumb'' and ''unforgivable'' by selling cars that had been driven while their odometers were disconnected. **********Mr. Iacocca's remarks came as the auto maker began a program to counter the unfavorable publicity generated by its indictment last week for selling 60,000 cars as new, although they had been driven - and in some cases, damaged. As part of the program, Chrysler will give new cars to as many as 40 owners of the affected models. Other owners will be offered longer warranties with broader coverage. **********Chrysler was indicted by a Federal grand jury, and two of its executives were indicted on criminal charges in the matter. The indictment said that Chrysler had failed to tell car buyers about the accumulated mileage or the repairs. **********The indictment covers an 18-month period from July 1, 1985, to Dec. 31, 1986. The Justice Department asserted, however, that odometers had been disconnected for decades and that millions of cars had been sold with inaccurate mileage readings. **********Chrysler's program to compensate customers will apply only to owners of cars sold within the last three years. Public Opinion Cited **********The company has argued that it did nothing illegal, and it continued to do so today. But Mr. Iacocca said Chrysler was being damaged in ''the court of public opinion.'' **********''Our big concern is for our customers, the people who had enough faith in Chrysler to buy a vehicle from us,'' Mr. Iacocca said. ''These charges and the press reports about them are causing some of those customers to question that faith, and we simply cannot tolerate that.'' **********Chrysler's initial reaction to the indictment was to denounce it as ''outrageous.'' Mr. Iacocca made it clear that today's more conciliatory approach had been prompted by concern that the public reaction would soon cut into car sales. He said a ''quick survey'' of 1,000 people had indicated that 69 percent of those over 29 years old were aware of the indictment. Sales Seem Unaffected **********A spot-check of Chrysler dealers in the New York and Detroit areas, though, produced few complaints about lagging sales. ''We've had a few customers come in who had read about it in the newspapers but no loss in sales,'' said Richard Brahs Jr., a sales executive at Stamford Dodge in Stamford, Conn. **********Bert Meimar, service manager at Farmington Hills Chrysler-Plymouth in Farmington Hills, Mich., added: ''I've had a few mention it, but nothing serious. It's still too new to judge.'' **********According to the Federal indictment, executives at Chrysler assembly plants routinely took new cars off the assembly line and drove them for as much as 400 miles with the odometers disconnected. In addition, the indictment charged, some cars were damaged in the testing and were only superficially repaired before being shipped to dealers to be sold. **********Mr. Iacocca said the company had done two things to make potential buyers wary of the company's cars. ''The first was just dumb,'' he said. ''We test-drove a small percentage of our cars with the odometer disengaged and didn't tell our customers. **********''The second went beyond dumb and reached all the way out to stupid,'' he added. Forty cars that had been seriously damaged in accidents were repaired and sold as new. ''Simply stated, that's unforgivable, and we've got nobody but ourselves to blame,'' he said. **********Mr. Iacocca said he had been personally unaware of the disconnecting of odometers until last October, when he was notified of the Justice Department investigation by Gerald Greenwald, chairman of Chrysler Motors. However, he said, Chrysler's lawyers had assured him that the practice was legal. New Cars to Be Offered **********To make amends, Mr. Iacocca said, the owners of the 40 damaged cars will be offered new cars of a comparable model. He said the owners would be notified by mail starting Thursday. **********Those whose cars were driven with the odometers disconnected will be given a seven-year, 70,000-mile warranty, extending the five-year, 50,000-mile warranty in effect when their cars were made. The warranty coverage will be broadened to include components that are not a part of the usual power-train warranty offered by the domestic auto companies. **********The owners will be notified by next week, he said, as will the owners of cars that were not driven before being sold. Mr. Iacocca said the company's records extend back only about three years, meaning drivers of older Chrysler cars and trucks will not be notified or included in the extended warranty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/21/business/executive-changes-087887.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** C.

But the immediate crisis was provoked by a Government decision to assign administrators who are not fluent in Mandarin to Chinese-language schools.

But even these are common enough on a continent troubled by many wars. **********Otherwise the landscape along the 180-mile road as it rises gently from the tropical coastal wetlands to the fertile highlands across the center of Mozambique is a series of idyllic images - thatched granaries and huts in fields of ripening corn, tall stands of eucalyptus trees, Africans trekking by the roadside or seeking refuge from the midsummer sun under spreading acacias. Loosening the Bonds **********A single railroad track winds alongside the road and a rare freight train chugs by at a laborious pace, a clutch of waving workers hanging from the battered caboose. **********The placid scene belies the momentous political and economic role that has been assigned the road, railway and the oil pipeline alongside. Known collectively as the Beira corridor, the installations have become the focus of an ambitious and high-stakes bid by South Africa's black-ruled neighbors to loosen the economic bonds that have effectively made them hostages to apartheid. **********The arithmetic is simple. The countries bordering South Africa channel almost 70 percent of their combined foreign trade through South African ports, a fact that leaves them vulnerable to serious economic dislocation in any sanctions war with Pretoria. Other Outlets Languish **********They used to have other outlets to the sea - the Benguela line to the Angolan coast, the Tazara railroad to Tanzania, the Mozambican ports at Maputo, Beira and Nacala. But all have fallen victim in varying degrees to wars, poverty, neglect and mismanagement. That has left South Africa, with its modern and efficient ports, to handle the bulk of regional traffic. **********Two years ago, the nine-black ruled nations of the Southern African Development Coordination Conference -Mozambique, Angola, Swaziland, Lesotho, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Tanzania - and a group of West European donors decided to revive at least the Beira corridor as a alternative route to the outside world. **********The project is of primary importance to Zimbabwe, which now sends 90 percent of its trade through South Africa, and to Mozambique, whose devastated economy would receive badly needed income and development from the revival of Beira, its second city. The corridor would also offer a shortcut to the sea for part of the trade from Zambia, Botswana, Malawi and even the Zaire copper belt. **********Nobody has suggested that the Beira route could free the Southern African countries from the potent economic draw of South Africa, whose $80 billion gross domestic product dwarfs the combined output of all the conference's nine nations. It will take at least several years before Beira can carry a relevant part of traffic from the front-line nations, and the most optimistic projections are that the corridor may reduce the trade the bordering nations send through South Africa from the current 70 percent to about 40 percent. Rebels Remain Active **********A major question hanging over the route is posed by the rebels of the Mozambican National Resistance, called Renamo for short. With Pretoria's help, the rebels have ravaged vast tracts of northern Mozambique. **********Security has improved since Zimbabwean troops began patrolling the corridor in 1985, but officials in Maputo said guerrillas still mine the railroad, road or pipeline from time to time. An official in Beira said that only four days earlier the rebels blew up some track, but he said trains were running again within hours. **********Chancy though the project is, the corridor has assumed a symbolic importance at least as great as its economic or political potential. The young black governments of Southern Africa feel they are faced with constant efforts by South Africa to destabilize them through military and econonmic pressures. And these nations, sensitive to the indignity of demanding sanctions by the outside world while remaining in economic thrall to Pretoria, see in the development conference and in the Beira project a chance to assert their independence and defiance. **********Western donors, primarily the Netherlands, Britain, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the European Community and the United States, have responded with substantial pledges toward the $280 million corridor project. From the East bloc, only East Germany has made any contributions. But nowhere has the corridor roused the enthusiasm that it has in Zimbabwe, which has by far the healthiest economy in the region after South Africa. 'Our Route to the World' **********In Zimbabwe's press the corridor has been hailed as the ''survival landline'' and ''our route to the world.'' President Robert Mugabe has committed more than 6,000 troops to safeguarding the route. Zimbabwean business executives have formed a Beira corridor group to pump private capital into projects ranging from the renovation of Beira hotels to raising new warehouses. **********The enthusiasm is bolstered by some purely capitalistic considerations. According to Denis Norman, former Agriculture Minister and chairman of the group, upgrading the shorter route to Beira would save Zimbabwe $85 million in transport costs. **********In Mutari, a provincial center at the Zimbabwean end of the corridor, business executives reported a boom in anticipation of the increased traffic. Prices of houses have tripled as entrepreneurs have moved in hoping to cash in on the expected demand for everything from rental cars to vacation resorts in Beira, once the playground of white Rhodesians seeking white beaches, prawns and sin. **********''Beira's more than just a port for us,'' said a garage owner in Mutari who has invested in a fleet of rental cars. ''A landlocked country like ours dreams of access to the sea, and Beira was traditionaly our outlet.'' That was before the Portuguese colonialists turned power over to the Frelimo Movement in 1975 and the Marxist Government closed its border with white-ruled Rhodesia. **********With the flight of the Portuguese, the demise of tourism, the rapid collapse of the Mozambican economy and the spread of the insurgency, Beira fell on hard times. Broken shop windows, vacant cafes and faded signs in what was once an elegant city center and abandoned kiosks along the broad beaches testify to the city's past affluence. Few Cars in the Streets **********The liveliest place on the main square is the externally ornate jail, from whose barred windows prisoners shout to friends and relatives outside. There are no taxis and few cars in the streets. **********A population once estimated at 300,000 has been swollen by 50,000 refugees from the terror in the countryside, and jobs are few. The biggest employer outside the port, a cement factory, closed for lack of supplies. Essentials are rationed. Electricity was cut for 165 days last year when the guerrillas blew up a row of pylons leading to the city, and a local generator manages only weak, sporadic bursts of power. Water supplies are equally inconstant; a guest at a comfortable government guest house is given a bucket of water at bedtime. **********The road to the capital, Maputo, is too dangerous to travel without military escort, leaving the Boeing 737's of the state airline, LAM, as the primary link between the country's two main cities. The competition for seats is fierce, and ordinary travelers often lose out to officials or foreigners with hard currency. **********But people here talk of the future, not the present. ''You can imagine the importance of this project to us,'' said Francisco Masquil, the young Governor of Sofala Province, which includes Beira and half the corridor. ''Beira is a city of the future. The new developments will have a very big impact. It will bring life back along the line.'' **********The future is most evident for now at the port, where the clatter of construction and the squads of workers offer a stark contrast to the moribund town outside. A team of Dutch engineers supervises the renovation of several berths, all more than 50 years old and crumbling dangerously. On March 1, the Amsterdam Port Authority is to take over all port operations. Ambitious Plans for Port **********At his headquartes by the entrance to the port, Rui Fonseca, director of the Beira Corridor Authority formed by Mozambique to coordinate financing of the project, outlined ambitious plans to raise the port's capacity from 1.3 million tons to 2 million this year, then to 3.5 million in three years and to more than 5 million tons by 1990, to deepen the channel and to raise the railroad's capacity from the present 2,500 tons a day to 8,000 tons. **********Zimbabwe National Railroads is replacing whole stretches of track, and Mozambique is looking to donors -preferably Washington, Mr. Fonseca said - for 100 new locomotives. **********The Beira corridor group is gearing up to restore two of Beira's old luxury hotels, to install modern communications equipment and to build new warehouses. Beyond that there are plans to upgrade sewers, restore power and water, and resurface the road to Zimbabwe. **********Zimbabwean farmers are looking hungrily at the land alongside the corridor, some of Africa's most fertile, for new plantations and farms that would serve to bolster security and feed Beira. The Zimbabwean troops, who patrol the road, ride each train, keep constant watch over the pumping stations along the pipeline and patrol by helicopter from a base at Chimoio, halfway up the corridor, have already had a marked effect. **********A Zimbabwean businessman who had seen the area from the air said the corridor was a lush green strip of thriving farms to which peasants had returned since the patrols began. **********Over a lunch of chicken and rice in Chimoio, a Mozambican marveled, ''This is the only place in the country where you can get all the chicken you want.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/13/world/charlestown-journal-here-s-to-nelson-and-his-bride-and-to-nevis-too.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1015, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HERE'S TO NELSON AND HIS BRIDE AND TO NEVIS, TOO", "print_headline": "CHARLESTOWN JOURNAL; HERE'S TO NELSON AND HIS BRIDE AND TO NEVIS, TOO", "body_text": " **********Two hundred years ago, on a flawless, sunny afternoon, Adm.

They say they thought they could capitalize on the historic wedding as a way of getting some publicity for the island and maybe attracting some tourists. Nelson Role Hard to Fill **********Some Nevisians grumbled, however, that a black island that had endured slavery and colonialism should not be lionizing a couple of white colonials. Others contended that Nelson, like Alexander Hamilton, who was born here in 1757, had never done anything for Nevis and that therefore there was no reason for Nevis to do anything for Nelson. **********Amba Trott, the son of a Nevisian mother and an American father, found people reluctant to perform in his musical comedy, ''Horatio,'' which called for an all-black cast. Most of all, no one wanted the part of Nelson. **********Finally, a 26-year-old former policeman named Dennison Murrain, who says he was once so furious about slavery that he went around looking for whites to beat up, agreed to be Trott's Nelson. And the play was an enormous success. **********Mr. Murrain, like several others, said he joined in because he began to see commercial benefits for Nevis. ''I felt this was a moment we could take advantage of,'' he said one evening at the Longstone Bar, where he was helping out as a bartender. **********Simeon Daniel, Nevis's 52-year-old Premier, took part in many of the Nelson events, but he, too, seemed lukewarm to the anniversary. ''We cannot change the history we have,'' he said. ''We have to accept it. If it can be used to our benefit I see no reason we shouldn't exploit it.'' **********Nobody seemed concerned that Nelson's marriage to Fanny Nisbet, a young widow with a 5-year-old son, eventually went sour and that he abandoned her after beginning a notorious affair with the wife of a British diplomat. **********Nevis has been living in the sunset since about the time of the Nelson wedding. It had one of the first hotels in the Caribbean and the great plantation houses were a swirl of dinner parties and dances when Nelson arrived to patrol the West Indies. **********But the sugar market fell away and the abolition of slavery in the early 1830's made working the island's stony fields prohibitively expensive. Nevis became an island of peasant farmers and fishermen that these days is not nearly able to feed itself. **********The re-enactment of the wedding took place Wednesday on another flawless, sunny afternoon under the same huge kapok tree where Nelson and Miss Nisbet said their vows. An English couple, Colin MacMillan and Caroline Hayward, who had been married a few hours earlier in a small church in Charlestown, played the bride and groom, he in tricornered hat and knee britches and she in a sprigged muslin gown and lace-trimmed bonnet. **********They had vacationed on Nevis earlier, learned the anniversary was coming up and decided that having their own wedding coincide ''would be a rather nice link with England.'' They were delighted with the request to star in the re-enactment, which was the third wedding ceremony for them, counting the legal one in London. **********The festivities got going last Sunday with a horse race. A dozen thoroughbreds had been shipped in from Puerto Rico, but the winner of the final was a native-born bay of somewhat vague lineage and the crowd went wild, dancing and singing about the victory in verse. Lord Nelson Regrets **********On Wednesday morning hundreds of young people turned out on the main pier to watch couples mimicking the ballroom dances of slave owners, a greased pole contest and a swimming race in which a local boy beat a team of English seamen. **********Not all of the invited foreign guests turned up. The Englishman to whom Lord Nelson's title has descended, a police detective sergeant from a suburb of London, said he could not afford the air fare. The Nevis historical society offered to send him a plane ticket, but the deal fell through when the sergeant insisted his wife's fare be paid, too. **********The French, whose fleet Nelson defeated along with that of the Spanish in the Battle of Trafalgar, declined with a curt response. ''Not for Nelson,'' said a French diplomat. **********Most visitors seem to think of Nevis as a kind of unspoiled paradise. But the British sailors had a different view. **********''No discos, not many bars,'' said Clive Moonesamy, a 26-year-old Mauritian who now calls Scotland home.

If our banks are to compete in the coming decades, they will need to be freed of some of the regulatory strictures that have hampered their growth. **********Financial regulation should strive to achieve a balance - to pay a reasonable price for security but not to pay too dearly. Unfortunately, current policy has struck a bad balance. New omnibus legislation, scrapping three key regulations while retaining other safeguards, would give the United States a more efficient financial services industry with greater international competitiveness. **********While the Treasury Department does not have a formal plan, it is widely supposed that top policy makers envision a system in which 5 to 10 major banks would compete with existing huge banks in Japan, West Germany, Britain and France. The superbanks would be owned in part or in full by industrial companies or bank holding companies, would expand into areas such as securities underwriting and would form interstate networks that would greatly increase their asset bases. **********Under current law, banks can do none of these things. The Bank Holding Company Act limits nonbank ownership of banks. The Glass-Steagall Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in corporate securities underwriting and dealing. And the McFadden Act limits interstate branching of banks. If the superbank concept is to become a reality, these three regulations will have to be amended. **********But lowering regulatory barriers is opposed by a wide array of interests. Opponents often claim that the quest for underwriting profits might induce banks to lend money to risky companies in hopes of bringing the companies' securities to market at a higher price. And if banks managed pension money, the critics say, they would be tempted to stuff the accounts with overpriced securities to assure the success of an underwriting deal. Finally, the critics assert that an unsuccessful underwriting operation could threaten the solvency of the entire bank, and that Federal deposit insurance would encourage excessive risk taking. **********In fact, loosening the restrictions would stimulate competitive forces, promote cost reductions, expand the set of available financial services and permit banks to diversify their sources of income (potentially reducing their risk of operation). **********How would the United States financial system work without Glass-Steagall? It would resemble in many ways the Eurobond market, where larger American banks underwrite securities through foreign affiliates. The Euromarket provides strong evidence that participants will behave prudently even when market entry is unrestricted and underwriting practices are largely unregulated. **********DISCIPLINE in the Eurobond market is provided largely by market forces and the participants' concern with maintaining a reputation for fair and equitable dealing. Thus, participants have brought mostly high-quality issues to market, developed market mechanisms to assure that new issues will be fairly priced and moved quickly to establish efficient, computerized clearing procedures to promote the secondary market. **********Further, as the Eurobond market shows, conflicts of interest can be managed successfully - primarily by separating the banks' various functions. For example, no money manager whose reputation is riding on his performance is going to allow an underwriter to stuff his account with overpriced securities. Moreover, strict separation of functions would insulate the bank and its deposit-taking activities from the possible depredations of individual affiliates. **********We could also expect to gain from interstate banking, which to a substantial degree already exists in the United States. Telecommunications and computer technology have increased efficiencies of scale in financial services. While Americans traditionally fear extreme concentration in banking, the more likely result would be industry tiering - money center banks would offer national distribution of financial services while a large number of regional and local banks would offer specialty services within their markets. **********By spreading their deposit bases as well as their lending activities, banks would reduce the risks of local and regional concentration that they now face. With a wider deposit base, Continental Illinois might not have felt the need to expand its interbank activities so aggressively, and it would not have been so vulnerable to a run by depositors. If Texas and Oklahoma banks could have expanded their lending activities outside their states, they would not be so weakened by the energy shock. By making international banking services more readily available throughout the nation, banks might also promote the export capabilities of small- and medium-size companies. **********Altering public policy regarding banking and financial institutions is a high-stakes game of balancing numerous, powerful political forces. But the evidence from numerous empirical studies, from United States banks' overseas activities and from foreign banking practices suggests that the Treasury is on the right course. Further deregulation would make the financial system more efficient and competitive, with a minimal risk to society."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/23/business/company-news-american-express-has-gain.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1987-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 477, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS GAIN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; AMERICAN EXPRESS HAS GAIN", "body_text": " **********Two of the nation's leading financial services concerns, the American Express Company and the Morgan Stanley Group, yesterday announced higher earnings for the fourth quarter of 1986. **********American Express, which has operations in travel-related services, international banking and insurance, said that net income in the quarter edged up 1.7 percent, to $277.2 million, or $1.25 a share, from $272.6 million, or $1.19 a share, in the comparable 1985 quarter.

Hayes, who heads Xerox's venture capital operations. Xerox quickly decided to invest $1 million in Kurzweil Applied Intelligence Inc. of Waltham, Mass. **********That reasoning makes sense to an increasing number of large corporations, according to venture capital experts. Venture Economics Inc., an information services company based in Wellesley, Mass., estimates that the nation's industrial giants invested a record $300 million in start-up companies last year. **********The primary goal of most of these corporate venture capital investments is to identify new technologies and the products based on them that have a strategic fit with the company. In Kurzweil's case, Xerox followed its initial investment with an additional $3.9 million. With that financing and $17 million from more traditional venture capitalists like Oxford Partners and Regional Financial Enterprises, Kurzweil has emerged as a leader in electronic voice recognition and a source of Xerox products. **********Xerox, which has non-exclusive rights to use Kurzweil's technology, already markets Kurzweil's VoiceRAD, a device that converts the oral observations of radiologists examining X-rays into electronic notes in a computer. It also plans to use voice recognition in office products. **********In many cases though, the 20 to 25 percent return on equity averaged by successful venture capital funds has been as significant a lure as the chance to gain access to new technology. Indeed, the likelihood of a substantial financial return has become the primary consideration of some of the most successful corporate venture capitalists, such as the General Electric Company. G.E. has backed several notable computer start-ups, including Tandem Computers and Stratus Computer Inc. and now has $260 million in the venture fund it started nearly 20 years ago. **********Technology experts say that the trend toward corporate venture capital funds underscores a grudging recognition by some big companies that many new technologies need to be incubated in an entrepreneurial environment that is tough to maintain inside a corporate bureaucracy. **********''Corporations have great difficulty managing internal start-ups because the management standards that work in the existing culture are totally inappropriate for a company in formation,'' said Zenas Block, the associate director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at New York University. ''Small companies can make decisions faster and get technology from the lab to the marketplace at a much quicker pace.'' **********Large corporations have adopted a variety of strategies to protect internally developed ideas from bureaucracy, including the establishment in some cases of venture capital funds intended for use by entrepreneurial employees. The Eastman Kodak Company, for instance, directs a substantial portion of its four-year-old $80 million venture capital fund to internally developed ideas that are ''outside the core business,'' said Frank Strong, senior vice president and general manager of Diversified Technology, a Kodak business group that includes Eastman Technology Inc., the venture company. **********When the start-up companies are successful in developing products, Kodak may then buy the companies. That is how Kodak, based in Rochester, added to its product lines lithium batteries and a device that provides overhead projection of the image on a personal computer screen. **********But venture capital experts say that many large corporations have learned it is hard to acquire truly independent start-up companies. **********''Large companies have had terrible luck in acquiring leading technology concerns because you just can't buy entrepreneurial brains,'' said Mark Radtke, president of Venture Economics. ''So they got smart and said, 'Maybe we don't have to own the company to get what we want.' '' **********For whatever mix of reasons, even such high-tech giants as the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which operates perhaps the world's largest corporate research facility, Bell Laboratories, now have active venture capital arms. **********A.T.&T. makes all of its venture capital investments through Edelson Technolgy Partners L.P., which was started by A.T.&T., the 3M Corporation and Gulf and Western about three years ago. The fund is operated by Harry Edelson, a former Wall Street securities analyst. **********Mr. Edelson's main concern is return on investment but he said that he also looks for business opportunities for his investors. **********A.T.&T. recently struck a major business deal with one company in which Edelson had invested, the American Telephone and Electronics Company. A.T.&E., which developed a wristwatch pager, has chosen A.T.&T. to provide the international telephone network for the service. **********Each month, Dr. Christian F. Horn, president of Grace Ventures, a division of W.R. Grace & Company, compiles a list of technologies that he reviews as potential investments. The list is circulated throughout the company to give division managers a perspective on emerging technologies. **********Grace has invested in 40 companies, including Oral Research Laboratories, which has developed a dental rinse called Plax that reduces plaque on teeth; the Micro Linear Corporation, which makes analog and digital semiconductors, and Biosis, a producer of pest control products. **********It is not always clear how helpful these arrangements are for the start-up companies. Analysts believe that General Motors' investments in five machine vision companies may have weakened several of them in the long run by skewing their product development toward G.M.'s needs shortly before G.M. decided to cut back its spending on such equipment. **********But other entrepreneurs see major corporations as especially valuable backers that can give them an advantage in marketing new technology."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/22/world/book-by-aide-to-mitterrand-causing-a-stir.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Bernstein", "pub_date": "1987-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOOK BY AIDE TO MITTERRAND CAUSING A STIR", "print_headline": "BOOK BY AIDE TO MITTERRAND CAUSING A STIR", "body_text": " **********When Jacques Attali, who is widely known in this country as President Francois Mitterrand's closest adviser, published an admiring biography of Siegmund Warburg, the head of the German-British Warburg banking dynasty, many in this country detected a paradox. **********It was strange, they said, that Mr. Attali, a Socialist economist, would make a hero of a leading capitalist banker, a member of a profession as widely distrusted by French populist tradition as tax collectors. **********Some said the book showed that Mr. Attali was not really a Socialist or, more likely, that Socialism had lost its ideological sting in France. **********But Mr. Attali, whose book on Mr. Warburg, ''A Man of Influence,'' will be published in the United States this year by Adler & Adler, says he sees no contradiction between his conspicuous political role and the scholarly interests that have led him to write 11 books on often rather academic subjects. A Writer First **********Sitting behind an antique desk in his office next to Mr. Mitterrand's, Mr. Attali asserted that he is above all a writer and a scholar, rather than a political figure. ''A writer cannot be identified with anything other than his own work,'' he said. ''I cannot be shrunk to my political ideas.'' **********''I wanted to tell a story, like a novelist, and I was fascinated by this one,'' he said of his interest in the Warburg banking dynasty, with its origins in the 16th century. **********When ''A Man of Influence'' was published more than a year ago, it was a literary event in France, topping the nonfiction best-seller list for some time. Presumably, some of the book's success was due to a certain public fascination with Mr. Attali, a kind of symbolic outsider now close to the heart of political power. **********Indeed, Mr. Attali's closeness to Mr. Mitterrand, and his reputation as a man of ideas, gave the epithets used in the French press to identify him a certain hackneyed ring. He has been called the ''shadow intellectual,'' the ''great pooh-bah,'' the ''hidden face of the Elysee.'' **********Mr. Attali in this sense reflects the image of Mr. Mitterrand, who has himself written 12 books. The Elysee Palace under Mr. Mitterrand, even more than under other presidents, has an air of attachment to intellectual life. **********Mr. Attali has written books on economic history, on music, and on the development of timepieces, all of them efforts, he said, to understand history by looking at a single theme over a long period of time. And his appreciation of Mr, Warburg, whom Mr. Attali calls ''the prince of finance, the adventurer of the century,'' seems to reflect some deep historic similarities between the two men that transcend labels and particular beliefs. Both From Jewish Families **********Despite obvious differences, there are clear parallels in the lives of the banker and the socialist economist that drew Mr. Attali to his subject. **********The biography of Mr. Warburg, who died in 1982 at the age of 80, traces the German-Jewish banker from his flight from Nazi Germany to England only months after Hitler took power; it then recounts his extraordinary success as a transplanted wartime financier of the Allies and creator of the postwar banking and monetary systems. **********Mr. Attali was born 43 years ago in Algeria, where his Jewish father, a wealthy merchant, studied Spinoza and instilled ambition in his children. Mr. Attali, who clearly relishes being friendly with the rich and powerful of this world, came to France when he was 12 and began a dazzling climb through the leading French institutions of higher learning, including the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the most exclusive and clubby of them all. **********When, after a career as a university teacher, Mr. Attali was appointed special adviser to the newly elected Mr. Mitterrand in 1981, much was made of his age - he was 37 at the time - as well as his Sephardic Jewish origins and the fact that he continued to write books in his spare time. **********Mr. Attali says that several aspects of the life of Siegmund Warburg seem consistent and even supportive of his own political ideas, even though Mr. Warburg was no socialist. **********''He was not a conservative,'' Mr. Attali said. ''He was mainly fighting for civilization, I would say. He was very demanding of both himself and of others, and I would way that that is a socialist ideal.

Traders were disappointed by the weak demand for the notes and worried that Japanese portfolio managers will not be avid buyers of Treasury issues. Credit market participants said they were also worried about the possibility of further declines in the dollar against the Japanese yen.  [ Page D25. ]  The worries that appeared as interest rates rose in the credit markets were compounded by the release of the Government's durable goods report, which showed a stronger-than-expected rise of 3.4 percent. That raised the prospect of a strong economy and an environment of high interest rates and inflation. **********Today's scheduled release of gross national product figures contributed to Wall Street's anxiety. **********Some Wall Street experts had expected stocks to build on Tuesday's rally, or at least hold steady. But others, who noted that Tuesday's big gain was dominated by the blue-chip issues, suspected that institutionally backed program trading was responsible for much of the advance. Computer ''buy'' programs were set off by the disparity between the value of futures contracts based on baskets of major stocks and the actual cash value of those stocks.

Decline Had Been Forecast **********Analysts, who had been forecasting a significant decline in January, said that mild weather helped increase the figures, just as it had in December. **********But they also said that the housing industry, which had been expected to weaken this year, is showing more strength than expected. **********David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said further declines in interest rates in January helped to spur demand for homes. **********For all of last year, construction activity rose 3.7 percent, to the highest level in eight years, as the housing industry enjoyed the lowest home mortgage rates of this decade. Rates dropped further in January to a nationwide average for fixed-rate loans of 9 percent with some parts of the country reporting mortgage rates as low as 8.5 percent.

It was the biggest monthly decline since March 1984, but analysts said the weakness was overstated. They noted that permits had risen a huge 18.4 percent in December as California builders rushed to take out applications before Jan. 1, when higher fees took effect. **********The Northeast, the hottest housing region last year, saw construction rise 7.5 percent in January, to a rate of 330,000 units, followed by a 1.8 percent increase in the Middle West, where starts increased to an annual rate of 404,000 units, the highest rate since December 1978."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/28/world/added-element-in-asia-confucius.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1987-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 694, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Added Element in Asia: Confucius", "print_headline": "Added Element in Asia: Confucius", "body_text": " **********As students take to the streets of South Korea, social campaigners go to jail in Singapore and politicians in China wrestle over a path to development, many East Asians are re-examining in an age of turbulence the clear-headed teachings of an ancient sage: Confucius. **********The director of the Institute of East Asian Philosophies here and head of a national Committee on Confucian Ethics, Wu Teh Yao, says he does not find this surprising. Professor Wu, a Chinese-born scholar in his 70's, tasted the learning of West and East before focusing on the study of a political system close to his roots. **********''Confucianism is neither a philosophy nor a religion - though it has the elements of both,'' he said in an interview at his National University of Singapore office.

Confucianism is a humanistic system, devoted to man's relationship to man, not to God. It emphasizes harmony with nature, respects intellect and education and cautions against greed and corruption, although not frowning on the accumulation of wealth. 'We Are Tolerant' **********''If you were to piece it all together, you would find it is an all-pervading unity,'' he said.

But that does not mean it condones authoritarianism or militarism, he added. If a leader loses the people's trust, the right to rule is forfeited, he said. **********''In all human societies, once the tummy is full, you begin to think,'' said Professor Wu, adding that a paper was now being written at the institute on the place of protest in a Confucian society. **********''So, whoever is going to rule, even in Japan or China, will have to pay attention to the people's needs and wishes,'' he said.

A Behind-the-Scenes Look **********American officials said they were unsure whether Toshiba's strategy would work. But they were fascinated by the unflattering behind-the-scenes look that Toshiba offered. **********Cultural differences notwithstanding, one Commerce Department official commented, the report shows that Japan ''has a few things to teach General Motors, but it has more to teach Ollie North.'' **********In fact, there are striking parallels between the actions taken by executives of the Toshiba Machine Company and those of Washington bureaucrats who have complained recently of annoying legal constraints that prevented them from getting their jobs done. Instructions to Employees **********Told in 1980 that the sale of the milling machines to the Russians violated Japanese export controls, the president of Toshiba Machine, Masanobu Hisano, instructed his employees ''to do what had to be done to get the business,'' the report says. When it became clear that the model names of the equipment about to be exported to the Soviet Union would cause suspicion, the machines were renamed for the benefit of Japanese licensing officials. **********And when the pyramid of lies began to collapse, Toshiba Machine managers systematically combed their files and burned anything that raised too many questions about the deal. **********''The Japanese don't seem to like shredders the way we do,'' observed Donald J. Zoeller, who headed the Toshiba investigation for Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Ferdon, the New York law firm that wrote the report. **********Mr. Zoeller's team provided a wealth of details about the transaction, but the outlines of the deal described in the report closely follow past accounts of how the Russians obtained eight state-of-the-art machine tools, capable of producing subtly contoured marine propellers. **********At the same time, the report -based on more than 40 interviews with Toshiba employees and a review of thousands of company documents - left several questions about the Toshiba scandal unanswered. **********For example, the report appeared to contradict accounts given by officials of Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk, the state-owned Norwegian arms company that provided specializied minicomputers known as numerical controllers. These guide the action of the giant machine tools. **********According to Kongsberg, its highest company official involved in the deal was Bernhard John Green, a British national, who supervised sales to the Soviet bloc for the company. But lawyers at Mudge, Rose say at least one of Mr. Green's superiors was involved in early negotiations. **********As many American officials had predicted, the report clears the Toshiba Corporation, which commissioned it, of any responsibility for watching over the actions of Toshiba Machine. The Toshiba Corporation owns 50.08 percent of Toshiba Machine. **********Toshiba Machine ''operated on a day-to-day business basis solely on its own,'' Mr. Zoeller said, as Toshiba officials in the audience nodded in agreement. The corporate parent was deceived by its subsidiary until late last spring, he said. **********That finding is critical to Toshiba's argument that punishing the entire company with an import ban would be ''unfair, discriminatory and counterproductive,'' as one Mudge, Rose lawyer said today. Company officials also contend that an import ban would put American jobs in jeopardy. Nobuo Ishizaka, chairman of Toshiba America Inc., denied that the company was lobbying to derail sanctions, which will be considered in a House-Senate conference on the trade bill this month. **********Rather, he said: ''our American employees are concerned about their livelihood; they are entitled to bring that up with Congress. I do not call that lobbying.'' **********While Toshiba says it should not be held responsible for past actions of its subsidiaries, it appeared to be reversing its hands-off management practices. Along with the investigative report, the company made public a 62-page ''Strategic Products Control Program,'' mandatory for all its subsidiaries, that sets rules for technologically sensitive exports. **********The rules will be administered by a staff at the parent company's Tokyo headquarters, and the subsidiaries will be subject to spot audits to assure they are obeying the rules. **********Mr. Ishizaka called the program a model set of guidelines, and he urged other Japanese companies to adopt it. While the Commerce Department publicly commended the move this afternoon, Congressional staff members working on the Toshiba case suggested the company was not in a position to lecture its industrial colleagues. **********The details provided by Toshiba today provide some insights into how Japanese companies deal both with Soviet officials and with political and competitive pressures at home. **********For example, two employees of Toshiba Machine, one a designer and the other a manager, apparently objected to the technology diversion. One of the employees ''was instructed that the proposed transaction was in the best interest of the company and that he should serve the company's interest,'' according to the report. That argument prevailed, and the employee later agreed - apparently unwillingly - to be the project manager for the sale. **********The report also indicates that the Soviet Government, while in need of Toshiba Machine's cooperation, did not trust the company. When Toshiba Machine's engineers arrived at the Baltic Shipyard in Leningrad to install the first four of the eight machines eventually delivered, they were allowed to touch only two of them. The other two apparently were installed by Soviet technicians, who watched the Japanese at work each day and then toiled in a separate building at night, putting together the other two. Toshiba engineers were never allowed in the other building."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/27/world/east-berlin-raids-staged-on-church.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EAST BERLIN RAIDS STAGED ON CHURCH", "print_headline": "EAST BERLIN RAIDS STAGED ON CHURCH", "body_text": " **********East German security agents, making raids on unofficial Christian advocates, detained at least 21 people and broke into the homes of several others in a three-day crackdown, church people said today. **********Nineteen of those arrested were released after three hours of negotiations between church leaders and the authorities, West German television reported. **********The crackdown began with a raid on a church library Tuesday night, followed by more arrests after a protest vigil on Wednesday. **********Starting early today, the authorities rounded up several other religious campaigners, many of them living in the Prenzlauer Berg district of the city, where the church that was raided is situated, the church people said.

The game offers both big rewards and high risks. Indeed, many holders of warrants have done quite well in the recent Wall Street surge. But not all warrant holders have struck gold; many issues covered by warrants are smaller, obscure companies bypassed by the bullish crowd. Stock options, another speculative play, have done much better, on average. **********However, in some ways, warrants are often more attractive than options. While both represent a right to buy stock at certain prices, the longest life of a listed option is nine months. Many warrants have years to run, enabling an investor to place a relatively low-cost, long-term bet on a company. **********When the bet is successful, a warrant payoff -like an option payoff - can far exceed the returns on the related common stock. In the last year, ICN Pharmaceuticals, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, ran from $10.25 to as high as $34. But in the over-the-counter market, the ICN warrants, which entitle the holder to buy the common at $9 through May 1989, shot from $4.25 to $26.25. The gains: 231 percent for the stock, 517 percent for the warrants. Of course, the volatility sword can cut both ways: By last week, ICN common had fallen about 28 percent from its peak, to $24.50, while the warrants had sagged 39 percent, to $16. And that was a modest drop compared with the routs in some other warrants tied to falling stocks. **********The warrant on MCI Communications, which enable the owner to buy the common at $27.50 until August 1988, have traded as low as 6 cents in recent weeks, as the stock drifts just over $6. For the warrant, that is a loss of more than 99 percent since 1983, when the stock topped $28. **********The market in warrants is a bazaar of unique -and sometimes puzzling - creations. They are usually issued by lesser-known companies as part of financings: to lower interest rate costs or raise equity sale prices by offering investors a kicker. Many warrants are issued by companies whose stocks are not covered by options. A warrant may give the holder a right to buy a full share at a certain price, or a partial share. The exercise price may change at various dates - $8 until 1988, for example, $9 after that. Some warrants may be called back by the company at certain prices before expiration. Expirations may be extended or other terms adjusted. In addition, stock bought by some warrants can be paid for with bonds, preferred stock or another senior security of the issuer, at face value. If such securities are trading below par, this can create a discount in the effective exercise price. **********''You are buying them for leverage, looking for more bang for your buck,'' said Allan S. Lyons, executive editor of Value Line Convertibles, a survey covering convertible securities, including about 95 actively traded warrants. Warrants, on average, are three and a half times as volatile as common stocks, according to Mr. Lyons, but ''only one-third as risky as the typical option.'' The difference is largely a product of the differing lifetimes of the securities - infinite, in theory, for a stock, years for a warrant, months for an option. **********Mr. Lyons looks for ''favorable leverage - where the warrant will move up faster than it will go down on equal moves in a stock.'' Usually such favorable leverage can be found in an inexpensive, but long-lived, warrant on a stock trading not far below the exercise price. ''If the stock goes up 10 percent, the warrant may go up 100 percent,'' Mr. Lyons said. ''But if the stock goes down 10 percent, the warrant may only go down 40 percent.'' This is because investors will still pay something for the warrant on the chance the stock will recover. **********As an example, Mr. Lyons cited the warrant on the Clabir Corporation, a small holding company trading at about $7.63 on the New York Stock Exchange. The warrant, quoted at 69 cents on the American Stock Exchange, enables the owner to buy a share of Clabir's Class B common at $9.34 until July 1991. However, using Clabir's $3.31 preferred in payment cuts the effective exercise price to $7.85 - just about the common's current level. ''On a 25 percent rise in the stock, we calculate the warrant would go up 175 percent,'' Mr. Lyons said. ''On a 25 percent drop, we think the warrant would go down only 35 percent.'' **********Warrants on three interest-sensitive Big Board issues were cited recently by Value Line Convertibles as timely buys: the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), exercisable at $44.25 until February 1991, trading over the counter at about $14.50, versus $42.25 for the common; Mortgage and Realty Trust, good for 1.5 shares at $20 a share until January 1992, trading at $3.13 on the Amex, versus $22 for the common, and Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), exercisable at $100 until August 1991, trading over the counter at $13.75, versus $72.75 for the common. **********But Sidney Fried, editor of the R.H.M. Survey, covering warrants, options and low-priced stocks, described warrants on Fannie Mae and Sallie Mae as ''just trading vehicles,'' lacking the spectacular leverage of a low-priced warrant. Indeed, Mr. Fried finds the 500 issues that his 25-year-old service monitors overpriced as a group. ''The play in warrants comes when a market turns down sharply and warrants go down to pennies,'' Mr. Fried said. ''Then, if there are enough years left in the warrant and the company survives, you can get some tremendous leverage. The real play is great patience.'' **********Mr. Lyons said that warrant premiums appear to be relatively higher now than those on options, reflecting speculative interest."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/25/world/china-names-acting-prime-minister.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1987-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Names Acting Prime Minister", "print_headline": "China Names Acting Prime Minister", "body_text": " **********Li Peng, a 59-year-old Soviet-educated engineer, was named Acting Prime Minister of China today.

During that meeting, every elderly party leader was dropped or retired from the Central Committee in favor of younger, better-educated officials. **********As China's new head of Government, Mr. Li, who was named to the ruling standing committee of the Politburo on Nov. 1, faces many problems, including management of an enormous, unwieldy and often unresponsive Government bureaucracy, uncontrolled inflation, growing urban and rural unemployment and rapidly rising consumer expectations. In addition, industrial productivity is stagnant, attempts to control population growth are floundering and agricultural production stopped increasing three years ago. Increase of Living Standards **********The extent of these problems has been largely obscured, however, by the sweeping reordering of China's economy since 1978, which has freed farmers from the limits of collectivized agriculture and has brought urban residents a dramatic increase in their standard of living. **********''A lot of things are waiting to be done, and the tasks facing us are not easy,'' Mr. Li was quoted by the official New China News Agency as saying upon his nomination.

The department named the Ambassador to Thailand, William A. Brown, to head its investigation. **********The pattern of fraternization by Marine guards with Soviet women has raised questions about the discipline in the unit assigned to protect embassies around the world and about the State Department's supervision of the young single men who serve as guards, officials said. **********All three of the marines arrested were guards at the embassy during overlapping periods in 1985 and 1986. **********One Government official said Cpl. Arnold Bracy, whose arrest last week signaled that the case was broad and had severely damaged the embassy's security, had been demoted by the Marine Corps while he was in Moscow because he met socially with a Russian woman. **********The departing Ambassador to Moscow, Arthur A. Hartman, said Monday that fraternization was a breach of regulations and that, had he known of it, he would have viewed it as a ground for sending a Marine guard home. **********Corporal Bracy was formally charged today with spying. The charge, which will be adjudicated in a court-martial, asserts that he acted as a partner with a marine arrested in December, Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree. **********Corporal Bracy and Sergeant Lonetree are charged with letting Soviet agents into the embassy and providing them blueprints of embassy offices, bags of secret documents and names of American intelligence agents. Charges Based on Statement **********The charges against Corporal Bracy are largely based on his statement to investigators, in which he also implicated Sergeant Lonetree, who had previously made a statement incriminating himself, according to Sergeant Lonetree's civilian counsel, William M. Kunstler. **********But Corporal Bracy has recanted his initial statement, according to Mr. Kunstler, who has called Sergeant Lonetree's statement a fabrication. **********The two men are accused of working as spies for a Soviet agent as a result of having been enticed by Soviet women with whom they had sexual relations, according to Pentagon officials. **********The fact that they were compromised in this fashion led to a broad investigation of the other marines who stood guard at the embassy in the same period in 1985 and 1986. This investigation led to the arrest of Sergeant Stufflebeam on Sunday, according to the Pentagon spokesman, Robert B. Sims. **********Sergeant Stufflebeam, 24 years old, of Bloomington, Ill., who was an assistant commander of the guard detachment in Moscow, ''is suspected of having associations with Soviet women on several occasions,'' Mr. Sims said. Contacts Must Be Reported Regulations call for the guards to report all contacts with foreign citizens, Mr. Sims said. Direct involvement of Sergeant Stufflebeam in the Bracy-Lonetree espionage case has not been established, he said, but the possibility is under investigation. **********All marines now assigned to Moscow have been recalled for new assignments, but questions remain about their supervision. **********Marine Corps officials have privately suggested that the State Department's security officer at the embassy, who was directly in charge of the marines, had not kept a tight rein on them. **********A State Department spokeswoman, Phyllis Oakley, said today that the Marines' detachment commander, a non-commissioned officer, reported to three civilian embassy officials - a regional security officer and his two assistants. **********She said all personnel involved in embassy security were being examined in the investigation of the spying episodes.

Shultz explore the offer in Moscow next week, but President Reagan decided that there should be no further talks on testing until the Russians agreed to new monitoring measures for two existing but unratified treaties limiting nuclear explosions. **********Arguments surrounding Mr. Shultz's visit continued today as 70 senators backed a nonbinding resolution urging him to cancel his trip in view of the dispute over bugging at the American Embassy in Moscow or find another, secure place for the talks. Instructions Given by Reagan **********Mr. Reagan's decisions on nuclear testing and other arms issues, contained in a secret Presidential directive, were disclosed as officials discussed his instructions to Mr. Shultz. **********The officials said Mr. Shultz would seek to clarify the Soviet position on reducing medium-range missiles, the most promising area in the arms talks. The visit was set after Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced readiness last month to negotiate a separate agreement on the medium-range missiles. **********The State Department was rebuffed on ''Star Wars,'' and its position on strategic arms was rejected. Mr. Shultz wanted to stretch out the period during which the United States would not withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty or deploy ''Star Wars,'' but the President insisted on a shorter period ending in 1994, officials said. At the Iceland summit meeting, President Reagan offered not to withdraw from the treaty until 1996 if the Russians would also agree to eliminate ballistic missiles. **********In another rebuff to the State Department, the President's instructions also change the American position on reductions of long-range nuclear weapons, spreading cuts over seven years instead of five, as discussed between President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev in Reykjavik last October. Mr. Shultz was not granted the flexibilty to negotiate less restrictive limits on Soviet land-based missiles or to remove the proposed ban on mobile missiles. **********For the State Department, the instructions to Mr. Shultz present a mixed picture. **********On medium-range arms, the United States does not intend to advance new ideas, which would require prior consultation with the allies. Rather, it intends to clarify the Soviet position. **********One clarification to be sought concerns hints that Moscow might agree to the total elimination of medium-range missiles. The hints were made by Yuli M. Vorontsov, the Soviet negotiator in Geneva, who reportedly questioned the military value of of having each side keep 100 warheads outside of Europe under a previous agreement. **********The Americans say he did not make clear whether the remaining medium-range missiles were to be eliminated under the pact now being negotiated or in a subsequent accord. **********The United States also favors the elimination of all medium-range missiles, on the ground that this would reduce verification requirements since there would be no need to monitor production and storage. **********The United States will also seek to clarify the Soviet position on the issue of limiting shorter-range missiles, with a range of 300 to 600 miles. **********The Soviet Union has said that as soon as a medium-range accord is signed, it will withdraw shorter-range missiles introduced into East Germany and Czechoslovakia when the United States deployed its Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in 1983-84. **********In a separate offer, the Soviet Union proposed to freeze such missiles. **********In addition, Viktor P. Karpov, a Soviet arms control official, has hinted to Western diplomats that Moscow might be prepared to eliminate the shorter-range missiles altogether. **********''The Soviets have three offers in play,'' said Kenneth L. Adelman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament. ''I think that one of the things we will accomplish might be to find out what their position is.'' **********The United States insists on the right to match the 130 Soviet shorter-range missiles. **********On nuclear testing, Andronik M. Petrosyants, chairman of the Soviet State Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, suggested last month that there be simultaneous negotiations on the ratification of the two existing treaties that already limit the size of explosions to 150 kilotons and on additional testing limitations. Under this Soviet approach, a total test ban would be the ultimate goal. **********The American position has been that monitoring of the two treaties, signed in 1974 and 1976, must be improved and that they must be ratified before there can be further talks. **********Mr. Shultz has been told to adhere to this position, officials said, although he will be able informally to discuss the subject of subsequent negotiations and to welcome the Soviet suggestion that a total test ban be deferred. **********On the issue of limiting ABM systems, the State Department also suffered a partial rebuff, officials said. **********The State Department had suggested that there be no withdrawal from the 1972 treaty for five years, to be followed by three years of additional discussion before deployment of space-oriented ABM systems could begin. **********The Pentagon recommended that the United States ask for a ban on deployment ending in 1994, when ''Star Wars'' systems could be deployed. **********Officials said today that President Reagan had decided that the United States should propose a period of nonwithdrawal ending in 1994. **********On long-range, or strategic, arms, the new American position is that the reductions should be carried out over a period of seven years, and not five years as previously proposed.

Their agreement, known as the Louvre accord, is now widely perceived as being rewritten, if not abandoned. Officials of the nations have never disclosed many details of the accord, and they were continuing to insist that their goal remained currency stability. The central banks bought dollars during the week, but with restraint, causing many economists and traders to conclude that the goal now was an orderly decline of the dollar. The dollar reached a postwar low of 137.20 yen and a seven-year low of 1.721 marks, rallied a bit, then steadied.  * * **********Stocks showed signs of healing. After a grim Monday that took the Dow Jones industrial average down 156 points, the Dow had three days of solid gains, including a 91-point advance on Thursday, and ended the week up 42.77, at 1,993.53. Perhaps even more encouraging, the buying spread beyond the blue chips to include thousands of the badly battered over-the- counter issues. Bargain-hunting no doubt accounted for much of the rise, but Wall Street also seemed relieved that officials in Washington were at least talking about the economy's problems. **********Bond prices lost the momentum of the previous week's spectacular gains.

But elsewhere, there are not enough new recruits to compensate for the number who are dying or leaving the priesthood. **********If the geographical shift in the clergy continues, a recent report by the Central Statistics Office of the church predicted, ''in a not distant future it will be necessary to redistribute new priests in areas others than where they were born.'' **********This report and other statistical studies recently released by the Vatican show that on a worldwide basis the church appears to have recovered from the manpower crisis it suffered in the 1970's. In general, far fewer men are now leaving the priesthood, and the number of men studying for the priesthood rose 41 percent in the last decade, with the fastest growth taking place since 1980. But the new priests are coming from new places. **********Although the United States continues to produce a large number of priests, it is the only major exception to a global trend toward improved recruitment. **********In 1985, the latest year for which the Vatican has statistics, 533 diocesan priests were ordained in the United States, a figure second only to Poland, which ordained 703. But between 1970 and 1985, the number of young men studying for the priesthood in North America dropped by 43.7 percent, according to a study published by L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican newspaper. **********Worldwide in that 15-year period, the population of seminaries dropped through the mid-1970's but registered an overall gain of 16.5 percent after a sharp turnaround.

With substantial growth in India, Korea, Japan and the Philippines, Asia registered an increase of more than 55 percent in the seminaries. **********L'Osservatore Romano calculated that in 1995 about 15 percent of the world's priests would come from Africa, compared with 5 percent in 1970. Instead of producing half the Catholic clergy, Europe will have only a quarter, and North Americans will drop from 19 percent of all priests in 1970 to about 7 percent. **********The regions where the clergy is growing fastest also have the populations that are expanding most rapidly, but the Vatican statistics show that the increase in the number of men beginning priestly studies substantially exceeds the rate of population growth. **********For instance, in Africa, where the church is strongest in Zaire and Nigeria, there were 10 seminarians for every million inhabitants in 1970, while in 1985 there were 18.

They fell from a postwar high of 18.7 percent of America's exports in 1981 to 13 percent at an annual rate in this year's first quarter. **********The debt crisis is the culprit, of course. The Latins can no longer borrow and spend in a big way. And the borrowing almost certainly won't resume in the next five to 10 years, which is when the United States must somehow find the buyers to bring down its $144 billion trade deficit. **********''We cannot expect that our trade problems are going to be alleviated in Latin America, as they once were in the 1960's and 70's,'' said Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. Added Lawrence Veit, international economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, ''The era of financing American exports with lending has ended.'' **********That fact helps explain why there is so much emphasis on getting Japan and West Germany, and also Taiwan, to consume more American goods. No one else has the extra buying power of these nations. Last year their current account surpluses -the money they earned from trade and other foreign transactions - totaled $137 billion. If Japan, Germany and Taiwan can be persuaded to lead the way in consuming American products, displacing Canada and Latin America, they will in effect turn over this big current account surplus to the United States. **********But there are broader implications in the forced retreat of the Latins. Without the lending crutch, Latin America now has to pay for its imports with earnings from its own exports, particularly exports of manufactured products. These exports are already beginning to grow, coming chiefly from Brazil and Mexico. **********In fact, the United States is buying from Mexico and Brazil enough oil, machinery, auto parts, shoes and other consumer goods to develop a trade deficit with Latin America over the last four years. That deficit is running at an annual rate of about $14 billion this year. The Latins are using the surplus money to pay some of the interest on their nearly $400 billion in foreign debt. **********The new earning power might someday prompt Latin America to look elsewhere for imports. The fear is this: If the Latins are going to pay for foreign purchases with the profits of their own exports rather than with loans from American banks, why should they feel obligated to buy American goods in the future? They could just as easily spend their hard-earned money on Japanese and European products - a development that has not even begun to show up in the trade statistics. **********''The danger is still far down the road,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. For the moment, the dollar's weakness has given American products an advantage over goods priced in Japanese yen or West German marks. This is reflected in recent Latin buying practices. Purchases of American products have been inching up over the last three years. **********As part of the program to reduce the trade deficit, the Reagan Administration wants Latin America to sell more of its exports to Japan and Europe instead of to the United States. But that sentiment does not extend to Latin purchases abroad. There is great reluctance among American officials to loosen the grip on the Latin consumer. **********The current solutions to keep Latins as buyers of American goods involve a return to the old borrow-and-spend formula. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d wants the World Bank and American, European and Japanese commercial banks to lend a total of $29 billion to 15 major debtor nations, including 10 in Latin America. The money would be used to ease debt payments, thus giving the countries easier access to private borrowing. **********Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, has proposed a similar plan, but with $42 billion in debt relief. And the Japanese Government last spring pledged a $20 billion Latin rescue fund. So far none of these plans has made much headway. **********Meanwhile, Brazil and Mexico have increased their manufacturing capacity, partly with the help of American direct investment and also with a growing amount of Japanese investment, although this still totals less than $8 billion. Mexico in particular is benefiting from laws that encourage the assembly of products for export to the United States. Fifteen Japanese-owned assembly plants are already operating in Mexico, and as many more are expected to open this year. **********''By the 1990's Latin America might solve its debt problem by becoming a manufacturing center,'' said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services. While that process unfolds, the Latin countries are not likely to be of much help as a marketplace for Americans struggling to sell more products abroad."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/30/world/palestinian-journalist-dies-of-wounds-in-london.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Palestinian Journalist Dies of Wounds in London", "print_headline": "Palestinian Journalist Dies of Wounds in London", "body_text": " **********Ali Naji Awad Adhami, a Palestinian cartoonist who was shot in the head while walking on a London street last month, died in Charing Cross Hospital today, a hospital spokesman said. **********Mr. Adhami, one of the most controversial journalists in the Middle East, was shot by a lone gunman outside the London office of the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Qabas on July 22. **********Policemen investigating the shooting uncovered a huge cache of arms and explosives in Hull in northeast England Aug. 12.

But several governments, including those of Malaysia and Indonesia, do not want to harm their relations with the Nonaligned Movement, a major grouping of developing countries, and other organizations by making a public statement on this issue. **********Asean nations are also committed to establishing what they call a ''zone of peace, freedom and neutrality'' in the region.

''Now they ask more focused questions: 'Should I stay in Hong Kong after 1997?' or 'Will foreign countries offer brighter career prospects?' '' Date for End of British Rule **********On July 1, 1997, it will be the marriage of the century: China, one of the most regulated societies in the world, enormous and sluggish; and Hong Kong, a monument to laissez-faire, a tiny, pulsating territory that already economically dominates a broad swath of southern China. **********The amalgam will have far-reaching implications for all of China, and even now, 10 years before the nuptials, expectations of what it will bring are transforming Hong Kong. **********But it is an arranged marriage, and one that gives the 5.6 million inhabitants of Hong Kong deep reservations. The apprehensions, which seem to be a particular preoccupation of the middle class, are compounded by the belief that Britain and China are conspiring to thwart the emergence of democracy, so that Hong Kong will not develop political institutions that could challenge Beijing. The colony is now governed by officials appointed by Britain. **********Iris W. Y. Lam, 30 years old, a slender, curly-haired banker with an easygoing manner reminiscent of her stu-dent days at the University of Southern California, is one of those leaving. ''My dad was in Shanghai in 1949, when the Communists took over,'' she said. ''The Communists promised people freedom then, but they lost everything.'' **********Miss Lam, who leaves next month for Toronto, worries about finding a new job and regrets having to leave the world she knows in Hong Kong. But she has no doubts about the wisdom of her decision to emigrate. In time, she says, she will find new friends, or old friends will join her. So far this year, five good friends have left Hong Kong, and she says others are planning to leave as soon as they have earned a little more money. ''Everybody is thinking about leaving,'' she said.  The Rush for Visas And a New Life **********Miss Lam is just a face in the crowd of emigrants, another professional leaving behind a vacant office and an empty bank account at a time when the fall of the stock market underscores the uncertainty and volatility that will accompany the integration of the two economies. **********No one knows just how big the exodus is, because Hong Kong does not keep emigration statistics. The Commission for Canada in Hong Kong, which gets more applications for immigration visas than any other Canadian diplomatic mission, issued 16,000 immigrant visas in the first nine months of 1987. That compares with 8,800 in all of 1986, although part of the increase this year is the result of a backlog of applications from last year. Australia granted 5,200 immigration visas in the 12 months that ended June 30, compared with 4,460 in the same period a year earlier. **********The United States Consulate in Hong Kong issued 7,585 immigrant visas last year, and the numbers have been fairly steady since then because of strict limits. Meanwhile, about 15,000 people from Hong Kong are studying in the United States, apparently more students proportionally than from anywhere else. **********Until the end of September, the United States limited to 600 the number of Hong Kong-born people who could receive immigration visas in any year, not counting spouses and minor children of American citizens. Many more visas were granted because many recipients were spouses or underage children of Americans, and because many were born in China but now live in Hong Kong. The limit was raised to 5,000 in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The United States gives preference to family members of Americans and to those with special skills. **********Some of those going abroad will return to Hong Kong in a few years, clutching their new foreign passports. But emigration advisers say that as 1997 nears, more and more of the emigrants, especially younger ones, say they will build their lives abroad. Over the Decades, Rise and Fall of Tensions **********The latest worries are part of a long history of tensions between Hong Kong and China. Lord Napier, the British officer who more than 150 years ago sought to wrest Hong Kong island from China, was mocked and given a Chinese name meaning ''laboriously vile.'' Britain obtained Hong Kong only by defeating China in the 1839-1842 war that forced the Chinese to accept the opium trade. **********More recently, the Communists have sometimes seemed ready to take back Hong Kong by force. In 1962 a wave of 70,000 refugees suddenly poured across the border from China to Hong Kong in a 25-day period, straining the territory's resources and raising concern that China had finally begun an unorthodox invasion. Just five years later, China encouraged riots in the center of Hong Kong that for six months shook the territory to its core. While the Bank of China branch in Hong Kong used loudspeakers to call on the people of Hong Kong to overthrow the imperialists, the British drowned out the incitements with loudspeakers broadcasting the thunderous screech of Chinese opera. **********Now China is again expanding its influence in Hong Kong, although in a more cooperative manner. Businesses based in China have acquired real estate and corporations in Hong Kong apparently worth well over $5 billion, while others are issuing stock on the Hong Kong market. The Bank of China is snatching business from other institutions by offering highly competitive terms, and it is building Hong Kong's tallest office tower for its new headquarters in the territory. **********The head of the New China News Agency branch in Hong Kong, Xu Jiatun, is China's top official in Hong Kong and functions as the ''shadow governor,'' the counterpart of Britain's top official, Sir David Wilson. Ironically, neither Mr. Xu nor Sir David speak the Cantonese dialect of Chinese spoken by 98 percent of Hong Kong's population. **********The main reasons for China's expansion of influence in Hong Kong seem to be to gain experience in capitalism generally and Hong Kong particularly, and to reassure residents that China does not plan radical changes in Hong Kong's way of life after 1997. **********Although the brightest young professionals are unconvinced, many of Hong Kong's manufacturers are optimistic that China will allow Hong Kong to remain a place to make and keep money.  The Sun Is Setting On British Influence **********As Chinese influence has expanded, British influence has declined. Last year, for the first time, Americans outnumbered Britons among the expatriate residents of the territory. The Hong Kong Chinese who hope to emigrate seek visas to America or Australia more than to Britain. And the old British companies that dominated commerce are being replaced or acquired by Hong Kong Chinese concerns. The tai-pans, or big bosses, had names like Jardine, Dent, Sassoon and Swire. Now the inheritors of the tradition of the greatest of the tai-pans - William Jardine, founder of the Jardine Matheson trading company, known to the Chinese as ''iron-headed old rat'' - have names that trip English tongues: Pao Yuekong, Li Kashing, Siu Yatfoo, Wu Yingseung. **********The British tai-pans still flourish, of course. But as a final indignity to the old order, a New York lawyer, Brian M. Powers, was appointed this year to be the next tai-pan of the Jardine Matheson group. In a relatively formal society, the 38-year-old Mr. Powers is a maverick. He calls people by their first names unless they are over 70 years old and worth more than $1 billion.  The Border Blurs For Shopping and Play **********Hong Kong is changing in another important way; it is becoming a part of China. For much of the postwar period, tight Chinese entry restrictions made it extremely difficult to cross the border and prevented information from flowing to the outside world. In the late 1960's China-watchers in Hong Kong assessed the violence of the Cultural Revolution partly by noting the number of bodies drifting down the Pearl River from China. **********Hong Kong is becoming more integrated with cities like Shenzhen, on the China side of the border. Working-class families in Hong Kong take advantage of lower prices in China by crossing the border for doctor and dentist appointments and to shop for vegetables on the weekends. Middle-class families cross the border to tee off on Shenzhen's golf course. And students attend university in Guangdong Province, both because tuition is low and as a way to ingratiate themselves with their future rulers. **********Among those who are neither middle class nor wealthy, there is some apprehension about the future, but it is tempered by the feeling that they have little to lose and that there is not much they can do about it. In addition, some with strong nationalist feelings believe that Hong Kong belongs to China and should be ruled by Chinese rather than foreigners. **********A few people in Hong Kong seem to welcome the Chinese takeover; they are particularly represented in labor unions, newspapers and independent high schools that have long been associated with the Communists. **********The jitters about 1997 are concentrated overwhelmingly in the middle class - which numbers somewhere less than a quarter of the population -particularly among young people who have been educated abroad. They may have more to lose and may feel they can do something about it - leave Hong Kong. **********Not all the Chinese who go abroad will be welcomed. Reports abound that Chinese criminal gangs known as triads are expanding overseas from Hong Kong as 1997 approaches. The Hong Kong police force says it has no evidence that this is so, but a report this summer by California's Attorney General, John K. Van de Kamp, warned that Chinese triads are believed to control 20 percent to 30 percent of the heroin smuggled into the United States.  The Passport Merchants: Profits From Fear **********''People leave Hong Kong because of fear,'' said Horatio C. S. Cheung, the director of a nonprofit organization that advises people on how to get a foreign passport. ''They came to Hong Kong with nothing, worked hard and accumulated some wealth. They don't want to lose it.'' **********That fear has spawned more than a dozen businesses that, like Mr. Cheung's, help people emigrate. Tucked in the phone book between Ice Skating Rinks and Importers & Exporters is a category called Immigration & Naturalization Consultants, with 14 listings. They charge hundreds or even thousands of dollars to help someone obtain a foreign passport. **********Even some foreign countries see the alarm in Hong Kong as a source of funds. The island nation of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean offers a passport in exchange for an investment of about $50,000. Industrialized countries are more expensive. Canada, which primarily admits people who are joining relatives or have special skills, offers immigration visas for some investments of $200,000 or more. **********The fear of China's takeover strains the fabric of life in other ways. ''The 1997 issue has an indirect influence on marriages, although not a major one,'' said Elsie Lam, a marriage counselor in Hong Kong. Families are being separated so that a member with a visa can be sent abroad to get a toehold in the hope of bringing the rest of the family later. In freewheeling Hong Kong, where there has been little compunction about extramarital liaisons, the separation of spouses reportedly has led to a boom in such affairs. **********Chinese parents are even relaxing their standards about their children's marriage partners. Parents usually want their children to marry other Chinese, preferably those who trace their origins to the same region of China. But these days ''gweilos'' - ghostly people, as foreigners are called - are in demand on the marriage market. ''Marrying another Chinese is important,'' said a woman in her 20's, ''but getting a foreign passport is even more important.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/08/business/pickens-is-considering-a-big-stake-in-singer.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1987-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1256, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pickens Is Considering A Big Stake in Singer", "print_headline": "Pickens Is Considering A Big Stake in Singer", "body_text": " **********Reaching again for a large military supplier, the Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens announced today that his Mesa Limited Partnership owns the equivalent of 4.4 percent of the Singer Company and may buy up to 15 percent of the aerospace and electronics manufacturer. **********The announcement came 11 days after the Boeing Company, the giant aircraft maker and military contractor, said Mr. Pickens was seeking Government approval to buy up to 15 percent of its shares. **********Industry analysts said that, in contrast to the situation with Boeing, which has a market value of nearly $8 billion, Mr. Pickens could easily finance the purchase of all of Singer's 21 million shares. They said a takeover could cost as much as $1.3 billion. Shares Rise $4.625 **********The price of Singer's common stock jumped $4.625 today, to $51.50, with more than a million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had traded as low as $37.625 as recently as June 30. **********Boeing's shares, meanwhile, lost 87.5 cents in active trading, closing at $51.25. **********Joseph B. Flavin, Singer's chairman and chief executive, declined to comment on the Mesa announcement, which was made before trading began. Mr. Pickens did not return phone calls to Mesa's headquarters in Amarillo, Tex. **********A Boeing spokesman, Harold Carr, said the company was unaware of Mr. Pickens's intentions toward Boeing or Singer. ''There is no indication that Mesa has lessened its interest in Boeing,'' he said. He declined to comment on whether Boeing had considered acquiring Singer, which is based in Stamford, Conn. **********Mr. Pickens is under pressure to produce additional income to cover an expected shortfall of $100 million between Mesa's cash flow and its commitment to pay $306 million in annual cash distributions on its common and preferred units. **********He said earlier that payments would be continued at current annual rates of $2 on common units and $1.50 on preferred units, through the first quarter of 1988. Mesa has invested in several energy-related companies this year, including the Amerada Hess Corporation and Burlington Northern Inc., but sold most of the stakes without making large profits. Focus on Military Units **********Singer has increasingly focused on its electronics and aerospace business since Mr. Flavin, 58 years old, became chief executive in 1975. It ranks 26th among military contractors to the Pentagon. Last year, it spun off its famous sewing machine operations - formed in 1851 by Isaac Singer and his lawyer, Edward B. Clark - to its shareholders. **********Singer's navigation systems help to guide military helicopters, the B-1B bomber and the space shuttle, and its tactical controls are applied in submarines and aircraft. Its flight simulators, once used primarily by the military, are increasingly being marketed to commercial airlines for pilot training. **********In jettisoning the sewing-machine business, Singer's revenues and profits both fell last year. It earned $58.5 million, or $2.63 a share, a 28.9 percent decline from the all-time company high of $82.3 million, or $4.30 a share, in 1985. Sales fell 29.1 percent, to $1.7 billion from $2.4 billion. **********In the second quarter, ended June 30, Singer took a charge of $45 million to cover cost increases on several military contracts. It lost $20.2 million in the quarter, compared with a profit of $21.8 million, or 98 cents a share, a year ago. Sales rose 4 percent, to $435.8 million. Bargains Among Contractors **********Mr. Pickens earned more than $400 million for Mesa in a series of unsuccessful takeover attempts in the oil industry between 1982 and 1985. His forays prodded the industry into a wave of mergers. **********Many analysts noted that, with a tightening Pentagon budget and narrowing profit margins, the military industry is in a position somewhat analogous to the oil industry of a few years ago. In the last year, Lockheed, Chrysler, Emerson Electric, Honeywell and Loral have made important acquisitions in the military-supply business. **********Paul H. Nisbet, an aerospace analyst with Prudential-Bache Capital Funding in New York, said Wall Street had driven the stock prices of many military contractors below their real values. That, in turn, has created the kinds of bargains that have attracted Mr. Pickens. **********Philip W. Friedman, a military industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York, said that Boeing, Chrysler, Allied-Signal and General Dynamics were among the potential bidders for Singer. **********Mr. Friedman noted that a buyer might want to sell Singer's nonmilitary businesses, which include power tools, vacuum cleaners and other floor-care products, as well as gas meters, regulators and instrumentation devices. Those units together earned $32.9 million before taxes last year, on sales of $294.5 million. **********''Singer is a prime candidate for a takeover,'' said Jon D.

Takeover Seen as Easy **********Catherine Montgomery, an energy analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette in New York, said that if no other bidders emerged, Mr. Pickens could ''easily manage'' to finance a Singer takeover. Mesa has more than $300 million in cash and credit lines of more than $600 million. **********Some analysts, however, said Mr. Pickens was more likely hoping to profit from a run-up in the stock. **********''I can't conceive of him making an attempt to acquire Boeing or Singer,'' said Rosario S. Ilacqua, an energy analyst with Nikko Securities in New York. ''To me, this is a continuation of the company's strategy to invest in undervalued situations.'' **********In its statement, Mesa said it had asked the Federal Trade Commission for approval to acquire up to 15 percent of Singer's shares. The partnership must wait up to 30 days before it can buy additional shares. **********The company said it owned a combination of Singer common shares and options to acquire common shares equal to 4.4 percent, or 922,240, of Singer's 20.96 million common shares outstanding. **********Analysts said Mesa would probably have to pay an average of nearly $55 a share, or $121 million, to acquire another 2.2 million shares.

Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said the two countries could be hurtling toward an accidental trade war, while a senior Japanese official said the trade deficit was America's problem, not Japan's. **********As the Friday deadline neared for the American imposition of stiff retaliatory duties on imports of Japanese semiconductor goods, American officials were ruling out a compromise of the sort that ended the countries' previous conflicts over trade. The President's special trade representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, said today that the conflict could be resolved in ''a relatively short period'' after the trade sanctions take effect. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has spoken in terms of months. **********But before then, officials warn, something could get out of control. **********''They are not going to start a trade war with us, with the amount of dollar trade they have with the United States,'' Mr. Lyng said at a briefing with reporters. ''But we may start a trade war with them accidentally. It's because they make the country so angry. If they make Americans angry enough it will cost them dearly.'' **********With one eye on a Congress that is pondering tough legislation against ''unfair'' imports, Mr. Lyng said: ''The access to that market has to be open. Otherwise there will be further steps to restrict access here. We're not afraid to do it.'' **********Mr. Lyng and Mr. Yeutter are planning a trip to Japan next week in what could be a new escalation of the conflict. ''On beef and citrus we're asking for total elimination of quotas,'' Mr. Lyng said.  The Japanese are bargaining hard for a truce in the semiconductor fight. They have sent their second-highest trade official, Makoto Kuroda, to make their case. Installed in a situation room on the fifth floor of the Watergate Hotel with a sizable staff, Mr. Kuroda has been granting interviews to American journalists and making the rounds of Administration officials. He saw Mr. Yeutter today. **********But Mr. Kuroda makes little room for new Japanese concessions. ''Imposing restrictions on us will not resolve the big issue,'' he said. ''The trade deficit problem is clearly your problem. Other people say it's the result of the Administration's economic policies.'' This alluded to American budget deficits, which some economists blame for the trade deficit. **********Meanwhile, Mr. Kuroda calls for American understanding of changes that Japan has already made in its economy, partly in response to American pressure. ''The situation has already changed,'' he said. ''Just please open your eyes, your ears to what is happening in our market.'' **********Mr. Kuroda said the Japanese were offended by American charges that Japan does not follow up on assurances it makes to stimulate its economy and to end barriers to imports. **********''The Japanese are proud of keeping their promises,'' he said. ''It is bad to hear our best allies telling us we are not trustworthy.'' **********But Mr. Yeutter told reporters: ''Policy-making in Japan must go beyond planning to execution. The marketplace is reflecting a dissatisfaction with governments implementing their proposed programs. **********''For example, just this past week the Government of Japan indicated it was prepared to move forward with a dramatic domestic demand package, and yet the marketplace did not respond favorably to that. It seems to me that the market participants have indicated that they have to see it before they believe it.'' **********''The semiconductor agreement was the accidental trigger of a crisis that was waiting to erupt,'' said C.

It is a question of honor, he says, a belated and unexpected chance to ask Korean voters to ''pass judgment'' on the Park Government's 18 years of economic growth and political repression. **********''I believe that we emancipated the Korean people from the yolk of poverty,'' Mr. Kim said, discussing the period from 1961, when he helped General Park stage a military coup, to 1979, when President Park was shot to death by his intelligence chief. **********''In the 1970's we were able to embark upon the process of industrialization,'' he said. ''I consider that period one in which we laid the foundation for democracy, and now in 1987 we should provide a stepping stone from which real democracy can come into being.'' **********By deciding to run in an election that had seemed unthinkable until South Korean politics was suddenly turned upside down this summer, Mr. Kim, 61 years old, has stirred worries among leaders in the Government and the ruling Democratic Justice Party. **********They fear he will take votes from their candidate, Roh Tae Woo, and have sent people to try, unsuccessfully, to talk him out of the race. **********Estimates of his potential strength range from 5 percent to 10 percent of the vote.

But before an election could be held there was another military uprising, led by Maj. Gen. Chun Doo Hwan. **********All three Kims were banned from political activity, and Kim Jong Pil, commonly referred to as J.

Many political experts also say they believe Mr. Kim is not interested in winning, an unlikely prospect at best, but to establish himself as a force to be reckoned with in future elections. **********''In my heart and mind, I was quite sure that the time would come for me to speak out,'' he said.

The blue-chip indicator had opened strongly, apparently on the back of some computer-generated buy programs, but investor concern about the weakening dollar, and declining bond prices, took its toll, and only some last-minute buying enabled the Dow to end higher. **********The last two sessions on Wall Street have been nothing to write home about.

International Controls already has one offer on the table, for $32 a share, from a group that includes the Bear, Stearns brokerage. This raises the possibility of a bidding war for International Controls. The company, according to Mark Walsh, a Morgan Stanley analyst, ''could support a higher price, as a leveraged buyout.''

Traders are still worried about the future course of the dollar on foreign exchange markets and about a possible sharp increase in inflation. Moreover, in the current environment they are also questioning their ability to drum up retail interest in bonds, even with the recent sharp rise in yields. **********That sentiment was pervasive among market participants yesterday. The anxiety was heightened by the awareness that the Treasury is to announce the size of its quarterly refunding in a little more than two weeks. **********''I don't know how it is at other houses, but all I have been asked to do all day long is to sell securities,'' said Alfred G.

Investors are on the sidelines because they are getting paid a premium to do nothing.

The yield level, already the highest on a 30-year Treasury security since November 1985, is almost certain to pierce 10 percent in the very near future, analysts said. **********''Ten percent on the long bond is gone,'' said one trader at a major investment bank.

[ Page 45. ]  Although the 30-year issue resisted breaking through the 10 percent yield level yesterday, the Treasury's 9 3/8 percent 20-year bonds did. Late in the day, the 20-year issue was bid at 94 5/8, down 1/4 for the day, to yield 10.010 percent. Short-Term Rates Mixed **********Short-term interest rates were mixed. Three-month bills were quoted at a late bid of 6.75 percent, up 11 basis points, or hundredths of a point. But six-month bills declined by 2 basis points, to a bid of 7.28 percent, and one-year bills declined by 6 basis points, to a bid of 7.57 percent. **********The activity capped a sorry week for the fixed income markets. At the close of business on Oct. 2, the 30-year bond was yielding 9.68 percent, nearly 25 basis points below yesterday's close. **********Although short-term interest rates have not risen as much as long rates, their rise has been enough to make a further increase in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve practically a foregone conclusion, analysts said. **********''Even though the picture on inflation and the dollar is better now than it was on Sept. 4, when they last raised the rate, the markets have set up another hike,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers. ''I would be surprised if the Federal Reserve banks have not asked for another increase.'' **********Last month the Fed raised the discount rate half a point, to 6 percent. **********The apprehension currently gripping the bond market is not universally held. Some analysts said that the sell-off has been overdone, and that all the market needs is one significant event to generate a major rally. **********''The sentiment in the bond market strikes me as being far too bearish right now,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns. ''We may be much closer to the peak on long-term rates than people realize. The fundamentals are improving, particularly on the policy side, regarding the dollar and the Federal budget. Evidence that inflation is slowing, a clear downward break in industrial raw material prices for instance, would probably trigger a strong, quick rally.'' **********A fear that rates may indeed go higher very soon may have been the driving force behind the issuance of a number of new corporate offerings yesterday. **********In the corporate market, underwriters led by Merrill Lynch offered $300 million of triple-A rated General Electric Corporation 9 3/8 percent extendible notes. The notes have a final maturity in 2007 at a price of 99.80, yielding 9.452 percent to 1990. After that, noteholders can sell them back to the company at par. **********Elsewhere, Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager on a $200 million 5-year note offering from the Ford Motor Credit Company. The 10.20 percent notes, which mature in 1992, were offered at par, or about 68-hundredths of a percentage point more than Treasury notes with a similar maturity. **********Finally, the Commonwealth Edison Company offered $200 million of five-year and 30-year first mortgage bonds through Morgan Stanley. Half of the bonds are due in 1992 and were priced to yield 10.40 percent. The remaining $100 million of the issue matures in 2017 and was priced to yield 12 percent.

Goodyear responded to his share accumulation with a sweeping restructuring that included a huge share repurchase to be financed by stripping the company of its energy holdings, in addition to the aerospace business. **********For Bernard L. Schwartz, the chairman of Loral, the acquisition fulfills a longstanding quest to forge a stronger presence in the highly profitable military electronics business. ''I'm on a personal high to have accomplished such a quantum jump,'' Mr. Schwartz said. The acquisition will make Loral one of the largest forces in military electronics. Once the sale is completed, the company's sales will more than double, to about $1.6 billion. At the same time the company's work force will swell from the current 8,000 workers to more than 16,000. Mr. Schwartz said that no personnel changes are planned for Goodyear Aerospace, whose main operations are in Akron, Ohio, and in Phoenix. **********Analysts said that the companies' lines of business and products would complement each other. For example, Goodyear Aerospace makes simulation and training equipment for the Navy and Air Force, while Loral makes similar equipment for the Army. Also, Loral produces airborne antisubmarine warfare track-ing systems. Goodyear Aerospace makes similar systems to be used underwater. **********With a couple of recent exceptions, ''Loral has done a phenomenal job in making acquisitions,'' said Jon D. Gruber, an analyst with Montgomery Securities. ''It is a well-run company. Mr. Schwartz's record there inspires a lot of confidence.'' **********Loral makes radar units, field radios, jamming equipment and other electronics gear. For the six months that ended Sept. 30, the most recent period for which figures are available, the company reported net income of $25.2 million, or $1.07 a share, on sales of $310 million. For the comparable period of 1985, the company earned $23.1 million, or 97 cents a share, on sales of $292 million. Prices on Stocks Advance **********Loral's stock was up 62.5 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $40.375. Goodyear's stock was up 50 cents on the Big Board, closing at $44.75. **********Goodyear Aerospace had sales of about $695 million and estimated pretax earnings of about $55 million. The division makes high-technology systems for military use such as reconnaisance and radar systems and electronic warfare systems. **********Much of Loral's growth has come from a series of seven smaller acquisitions since 1980, including its purchase two years ago of both Hycor Inc. and the military equipment division of the International Business Machines Corporation's Rolm division for $90 million. **********But the company has been looking for a major expansion for some time. Loral was thwarted last year in a $980 million bid for Sanders Associates Inc., a New Hampshire military electronics company, when it was outbid by the Lockheed Corporation, which paid $1.18 billion. Loral also failed to acquire the Sperry Aerospace Group, which was bought by Honeywell Inc. **********And last summer, Loral was eliminated from the field of bidders on an $8 billion electronic warfare system for future tactical aircraft to be flown by the Navy and, eventually, the Air Force, according to Wall Street analysts and Government officials. Prominent Takeover Targets **********Although they have, encountered problems and erratic earnings progress, military electronics properties have been prominent takeover targets in recent months. High-technology sectors such as military electronics are widely viewed as a principal growth area even if military spending over all plateaus. **********Last October, for example, the Emerson Electric Company agreed to buy the Hazeltine Corporation, a producer of electronic equipment, whose main customers are the Defense Department and Government agencies. **********The Boeing Company and the General Dynamics Corporation are said to be looking to expand their military electronics business. At the same time, the Grumman Corporation, TRW Inc. and Fairchild Industries have been rumored to be takeover targets. **********Some analysts criticized today's acquisition, saying Loral was assuming too much debt. ''The company's books would have more than $700 million in debt and only $350 million in equity,'' one analyst said.. **********Loral was not alone in bidding for Goodyear's aerospace holdings. The Martin Marietta Corporation also made an offer, Goodyear officials said. **********Still on the block are Goodyear's Celeron division, an oil and gas concern engaged in constructing a 1,750-mile pipeline linking offshore California wells to Texas refineries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/07/world/iran-contra-panels-are-continuing-their-inquiry-official-says.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1987-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1096, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iran-Contra Panels Are Continuing Their Inquiry, Official Says", "print_headline": "Iran-Contra Panels Are Continuing Their Inquiry, Official Says", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the House committee on the Iran-contra affair said today that the staffs of the select committees had not finished their investigation and would continue to pursue leads in the weeks before a final report in October. **********''For almost every single witness, there are questions that we don't know the answer to that we probably should know the answer to,'' said the chairman, Lee H.

Questions on Israel's Role **********Mr. Hamilton said the investigators would also try to resolve unanswered questions about the role played by Israel in the arms sales to Iran and about the secret financial transactions that accompanied the arms sales and the tranfer of some profits to the contra rebels in Nicaragua. **********The House and Senate select committees completed their public sessions on Monday. Today they finished three days of closed hearings in which they heard testimony from officials of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Legislation Won't Help **********But if it contains nothing but ''safe attitudes and glittering generalities,'' he added, no one will pay attention. **********Mr. Hamilton said, and many other members of the committees from both parties agree, that by and large the abuses of the government process exposed by the Congressional investigation were not susceptible to correction by new legislation. **********That is in contrast to the attitude in Congress after the Watergate investigations in the 1970's. Then, Congress passed legislation regulating campaign financing and restricting the warmaking power of Presidents, among other measures. **********''This was a failure of people, not of the system,'' said Warren B. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican and the vice chairman of the Senate committee. ''You cannot pass laws that will improve on human judgment.'' 'Resist the Temptation' **********The leading Republican on the House committee, Dick Cheney of Wyoming, made a similar point in his summation speech this week. He said: ''I would urge my colleagues to resist the temptation to enact legislation designed to guarantee that no future President makes the mistakes that Ronald Reagan made in this instance. In my opinion, there is no justification for further restrictions on the power and flexibility of future Presidents.'' **********Many of the legislators said they expected that the mere exposure of flaws in the way foreign policy was conducted in the Reagan Administration would keep future Presidents from making the same mistakes. ''The inoculation of the airing and the condemnation of the behavior will have some effect in preventing this kind of thing from happening soon again,'' said Representative Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington. **********But one step does appear to be supported by a majority on the committees: a tightening of the requirements under which a President must inform Congress of covert actions. **********Under law, Presidents are supposed to tell specified members of Congress before secret intelligence operations are begun. If Congress cannot be told in advance, because there is no time to do so or because the risk of exposure is too great, then Congress must be told in a ''timely'' fashion. Criticism of Reagan **********The Iran arms sales continued for more than a year without notification of Congress. Some legislators have suggested that notification be required within 48 hours. **********Representative Foley, who is the House majority leader and whose views thus carry much weight, said he did not oppose a 48-hour notification requirement. But he said he doubted it would make any difference in the case of the Reagan Administration. **********''This President asserts the Constitutional right to deny Congress access to foreign-policy information,'' Mr. Foley said. ''There is only a limited degree to which we can assure that a President doesn't ignore the law.'' **********Most of the Republicans on the select committees favor abolishing the separate Senate and House Intelligence Committees and replacing them with a smaller joint committee. They argue that Presidents would be more likely to share secrets with Congress if fewer legislators and staff assistants had access to them. Joint Committee Unlikely **********''The willingness of Administration officials to share highly classified information is directly related to their confidence that we can keep a confidence,'' Mr. Cheney said. **********But such a joint committee does not appear to be in the offing. Neither the House nor the Senate are likely to be willing to give up having their own intelligence panels with their own leadership and staffs. **********Perhaps more important, many senior lawmakers do not believe a joint intelligence committee is a good idea. **********''Intelligence committees cannot function unless they are surrogates for the rest of the House and the Senate,'' said Mr. Foley. ''You can't have one or two people getting all the information because that would not reflect the confidence of the whole House or the whole Senate.'' **********Representative Henry J. Hyde, a Republican from Illinois and a member of the Iran-contra committee, is the chief House sponsor of legislation to establish a joint intelligence committee. He said he was fighting long odds. **********But even if he succeeded, he said, it would not solve the main problems that surfaced during the hearings. **********''It's the people who are crucial,'' Mr. Hyde said. ''You have to have people who understand that you can't run a foreign policy against Congress. If Congress won't agree with you, you have to try to change Congress.

Finkelstein, chairman of R. H. Macy & Company, the nation's fourth-largest department store chain, found himself increasingly preoccupied with two problems. Some of his most talented executives were restless; a few were leaving for better-paying jobs with more authority at other retailers. And Macy stock was moving up in a way that suggested the possibility that someone was planning to launch a hostile takeover. **********After pondering several possibilities, Mr. Finkelstein decided that a leveraged buyout would be the best way to address the problems. Following some backing and forthing on the price, shareholders overwhelmingly approved the $3.6 billion deal last July. **********Seven months later, Mr. Finkelstein is ready to declare the new Macy's a success. Financial results for the the first quarter after the buyout, ending Nov. 1, were well above expectations; sales increased 16.4 percent, to $1.23 billion (thanks in part to the opening of two new stores), and instead of the $28 million loss foreseen at the time of the buyout, Macy lost only $8.6 million. **********More importantly, the buyout seems to have prompted a healthy change in corporate culture. ''There's no question in my mind that it is working well because we have unleashed an entrepreneurial spirit here,'' said Mr. Finkelstein. **********Despite that rosy assessment, it is far too early to judge the success of the Macy deal, one of the largest leveraged buyouts ever. In a leveraged buyout, a group of managers, supported by outside investors, borrows a great deal of money to buy the company; the loans are secured with the assets and future earnings of the company being bought. Ultimately, the managers hope to take the company public again at a far higher price. The financial community expects Macy to go public again as soon as it has paid down enough of its debt to start showing regular profits. According to forecasts made at the time of the buyout, that would be in the early 1990's. PROPONENTS of leveraged buyouts argue that they are healthy because they increase management's financial stake in the company's success or failure. But critics contend that is a breach of fiduciary responsibility for the company's management to, in effect, mortgage the company's assets so that they can buy the company. And in some cases, managers have taken a company private, done some fast financial shuffling and taken the company public again, netting tremendous gains without really strengthening the company. **********The Macy deal illustrates some of the advantages and disadvantages of the leveraged buyout approach. Many employees have responded to the buyout with increased enthusiasm and a spirit of cooperation. But some are already showing signs of restlessness. Investors must wait five to seven years for the deal to begin paying off, and there is no guarantee that Macy will perform well enough to generate rich rewards. During that time, there may be little chance for advancement, since managers who have invested heavily in the buyout are unlikely to leave. **********Leveraged buyouts are also supposed to free a company from Wall Street's constant demands for short-term results. But the enormous debt used to finance a leveraged buyoutn can be just as difficult to cope with. Walter K. Levy, who runs his own retail marketing consulting concern, says that in moving from a public to a private corporation, Macy ''substituted the pressure from Wall Street for pressure from its lenders.'' **********Mr. Finkelstein financed the deal by borrowing $3.5 billion from a group of banks led by Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover and Bankers Trust. He has now launched a cost-cutting campaign and a push for quick profits that have led some employees to begin referring to him as ''Crazy Eddie'' - a reference to the electronics discounter whose ads promote an image of frenzied selling activity. Some Macy executives believe that under the buyout the company may have changed for the worse, seeking quick profits at the expense of risk-taking in an industry where caution can be fatal. **********In implementing the buyout, Mr. Finkelstein sought to make it easy for employees to participate. Employees were allowed to cash in their Macy stock and invest the proceeds in the equity pool being assembled for the buyout. There were three classes of investors. Division heads contributed about $200,000 apiece, senior vice presidents about $75,000 to $80,000 and vice presidents and merchandise administrators about $18,000. Altogether, 345 executives contributed a total of $17.9 million, giving them a combined 20 percent share of the company. Mr. Finkelstein's stake alone is 4.7 percent. **********Along with Macy executives, the deal had some prominent backers, including Laurence A. Tisch, chairman of CBS Inc. and the Loews Corporation, who bought a 15 percent stake in the company, and Alfred Taubman, a leading shopping-center developer, who bought a 5 percent stake. **********During the transition, Finkelstein and Macy president Mark S. Handler met with groups of executives to explain his goals for the new company. After the meetings, a number of executives decided they would not function well in the new environment, and either resigned or declined to become investors. Most were executives in their mid-50's who said they were concerned that they would have to work longer and harder under the new structure. **********For those who invested in the buyout, the potential rewards looked rich indeed. Projections made at the time of the buyout called for Macy's sales to increase between 8.7 and 11 percent annually over the next eight years. (Over the past five years, sales have grown by an averaged of 13.5 percent annually). On that basis, Macy would register net losses annually until 1990, when it would have a $30 million profit; profits would increase from then on. If the forecasts turn out to be accurate, someone who contributed $70,000 to the equity pool would have stock worth about $3.5 million to $4 million at the end of a five- to seven-year period. A $17,500 investor could hope for as much as $1.5 million. **********The prospect of such handsome payoffs has apparently generated important attitude changes among most Macy senior executives. A spirit of cooperation, many say, has replaced one of internal competition. Harold Kahn, head of Macy's California division, for example, said that since the buyout he has made a practice of phoning the chief executives of other Macy divisions to discuss the success or failure of various product lines. **********To inject a little entrepreneurial spirit into the sales ranks, Macy recently began putting all of its salespeople on commission. (Traditionally, only salespeople in such big-ticket areas as home furnishings worked on commission.) Mr. Finkelstein hopes that the change will improve customer service, which has been a weak spot, as it is in many other large stores. **********The commission system paid an unexpected dividend: store managers now will devote their breaks to working the sales floor as a way of picking up extra cash. As a result, they have more direct contact with customers and get valuable feedback on their likes and dislikes. **********In the immediate aftermath of the buyout Macy executives seemed to withdraw into a bunker, curtailing contact with their own suppliers and other retailers as they plotted out their next moves. Mr. Finkelstein explained that he didn't want his employees to be distracted during this critical period. Macy began withholding monthly sales figures normally shared within the industry, because, Mr. Finkelstein said, he wanted his employees to concentrate on profit, not market share. EAGER to cut costs wherever possible, Macy reviewed every expense looking for potential savings. It cut back on advertising expenses and began consolidating support services such as finance and accounting. Even the traditional Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, a centerpiece of the holiday celebration in New York since 1924, seemed to be in danger of cancellation. **********To begin paying down its debt, Macy sold its full or partial interests in eight shopping centers last month, netting $400 million. Macy retains partial interest in three shopping centers. At the same time, however, Macy has continued its policy of opening new stores, particularly in the Sunbelt, even though sales in the Sunbelt have been disappointing since the recent slump in energy prices. **********Caution has become a watchword, some within the company complain. Mr. Finkelstein had made Macy successful by constant innovation: He lured legions of young, affluent and fashion-consious customers with chic merchandise, abundant inventories and imaginative counter displays. Since the buyout, Macy has been taking fewer risks - selling only what it already knew would sell and cutting back on product lines to save inventory costs. And its advertising, which had pushed upscale goods at full price, began to emphasize discounts, in a throwback to a former bargain-basement image. ''For the first time, I see evidence that Macy is becoming more promotional,'' said Roger Barrer, co-president of Alexander's Inc., the New York discounter. ''When you see them practically offering two men's suits for the price of one, you know they are pushing hard for volume and cash flow.'' **********Macy, like many other retailers, is increasing its emphasis on private-label goods, such as its Christopher Hayes and Loft & Brownstone mens clothing lines. Made to Macy specifications, such goods offer a higher profit margin than brand-name items. Private-label goods now account for nearly 25 percent of total sales. Macy recently announced plans to offer its private label goods to other, noncompetitive retailers. **********While the moves are designed to make Macy profitable, not everyone has been happy under the new structure. Executive recruiters report an increase in inquiries from Macy executives, including some who invested in the buyout. ''The improved results are encouraging a lot of Macy people to believe that they are going to make it, pay off the debts and eventually cash in when the company once more goes public,'' said Herbert Mines, a former Macy senior vice president for human resources who now runs his own New York recruiting concern. ''But Macy insiders say that the drive to do that is causing management to focus on the short term rather than on the long term as it used to. A lot of people like it and are pitching in. But some don't and they want out.'' **********According to Mr. Mines, executives who have invested from the $18,000 to the $80,000 level are the most restless about the projected five- to seven-year wait for the deal to pay off. ''That means that in addition to the fact that there's always the possibility that this won't work out well, they are concerned about the lack of advancement implicit in the investment made by their superiors,'' Mr. Mines said. ''If the bosses are locked in, the underlings can't move up, can they?'' **********It seems fitting that Mr. Finkelstein, 61 years old, ended up as a principal owner of Macy. A 40-year veteran of the company, Mr. Finkelstein became chairman and chief executive in 1980. His success in transforming Macy's image from stodgy to trendy and its performance from erratic to solidly profitable gave Mr. Finkelstein the reputation as one of the nation's top retailing executives. Macy is now the nation's fourth-largest department store company; only May, Federated and Dayton Hudson are larger. **********Nonetheless, he was still just an employee. Mr. Finkelstein's buyout proposal offended Jack I. Straus, the former Macy chairman and descendant of Isidor and Nathan Straus, who had bought the business from the heirs of Rowland H. Macy in the late 19th century. Mr. Straus died in 1985, before the buyout was completed. Other members of the Straus clan were also unhappy that an executive who came up through the ranks wanted to lead a takeover of the company. But family opposition to the buyout never got beyond the grumbling stage, because they owned only 1.5 percent of Macy stock at the time the proposal was made. **********''When Jack was here, Macy's stock was selling for $10 a share, and Mr. Straus's holdings were worth only about $10 million,'' said Mr. Finkelstein. In 1986, en route to the buyout, he said, ''That stock went up to $50 a share, so that his holding rose to $50 million.'' **********''He really had nothing to complain about,'' says Mr. Finkelstein. Now, Mr. Finkelstein will have to hope that he can do as well for the new owners, including himself, as he did for the Straus family.

But now that another competitor has entered the rapidly expanding market, battery makers are emphasizing gold and copper - as well as rebates, coupons and some new technology - to try to insure that their brand goes into the watches, toys, radios and other electronic gear that have made batteries a big business. **********Until recently, the $2.5 billion domestic battery market was dominated by Duracell USA and the Eveready Battery Company, with a fistful of smaller players. Life was relatively peaceful - and profitable. **********Then the Eastman Kodak Company entered the picture last July, with batteries made by Matsushita, the Japanese electronics giant. **********''It has turned into quite a war,'' said Eugene G. Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. ''The battle, however, is marketing, since there is no real clear superiority.'' **********To defend or increase market share, battery makers are using more advertising, more in-store promotions and more consumer discounts - all of which have cut into their bottom lines, according to analysts and industry officials. **********The manufacturers seem convinced that it is a market worth fighting for. With the profileration of electronic gadgets, sales of alkaline batteries are expected to grow about 10 percent a year in the next decade. Alkalines are the largest-selling, the longest-lasing and the highest-priced commercial batteries. The production cost of a C cell alkaline, the size used in many flashlights, is estimated to be less than 50 cents, but they sell at retail for up to $1.75. **********The sales growth and the high profit margins caused Kraft Inc. to keep its Duracell division last summer, despite the company's highly publicized back-to-basics restructuring in which it spun off all its other nonfood businesses. **********The business is attractive enough that the Ralston Purina Company was willing to pay $1.42 billion last June to acquire Eveready from the Union Carbide Corporation. A Strategic Fit **********Both Ralston and Kraft thought that batteries fit in nicely with their distribution channels for consumer packaged goods. Batteries also fit well with Kodak's film distribution in drugstores and grocery chains. **********To differentiate itself from Duracell and to a lesser degree from Eveready's Energizer alkaline brand, Kodak has gold-plated its contact tips, the part of the battery through which electricity passes to the device. **********Because gold does not tarnish, which would impede the passage of electricity, it is widely used by computer, aerospace and telecommunications makers. But battery experts are not convinced that gold tips are a benefit in consumer devices such as audio cassette players. **********''They probably don't use that much gold to make a difference and even if they did, the average consumer would not be able to tell the difference under normal conditions,'' Robert A. Powers said of Kodak's batteries. He is an industry liaison for Case Western University, and until last year was the director of technology for Eveready. ''To be really effective, you'd have to have gold tips inside the device, and most devices don't.'' Testing the Products **********It can be difficult to sort out the conflicting boasts of the manufacturers. Consumer Reports did its last test on consumer batteries in 1983, long before Kodak entered the scene and before Eveready and Duracell introduced their current generation of batteries. **********Each manufacturer cites independent tests showing that its brand is the longest lasting - under the right conditions. For example, Kodak outperformed Duracell in a test of C cells in flashlights. Duracell outlasted Kodak in a test involving a toy bird. **********''Unfortunately, the consumer remembers how long it lasted in the commercial, not in a test,'' said Ralph J. Brodd, formerly a battery researcher for the Amoco Corporation and now a manager of a lithium battery project at Gould Inc. **********Performance aside, Kodak has what it calls ''perceptual'' reasons for using gold. ''Gold is a precious metal that means high quality,'' said Martin H. Adams, the vice president and general manager of Ultra Technologies, as Kodak calls its battery division. ''It serves a marketing and product-enhancement purpose.'' **********Kodak has already captured about 5 percent of the market, at the expense of the small players and Duracell. That leaves Duracell and Eveready with about 45 percent each. Currency a Factor for Kodak **********Kodak does not disclose sales or earnings for the division. But analysts expect batteries to be a costly venture for Kodak, which is based in Rochester. One problem: the rising yen, which makes Matsushita's batteries more expensive for Kodak. Indeed, some analysts say Kodak will run into the same currency problem that recently forced the General Electric Company to break its ties with Matsushita, which produced color televisions for G.E.. **********''The yen has got to be hurting Kodak's bottom line,'' said Mr. Glazer of Dean Witter. **********Duracell, the maker of the ''copper top battery,'' which contains no copper except on the case, contends that its product has an advantage over Kodak's because of a design change made two years ago. That change, which Eveready also made, eliminated an interior wall, providing more room for the battery's active ingredient and extending the battery's life. As with many other things in the battery industry, it is a matter of contention as to which company came up with the improvement first. **********While technology gets attention, it is advertising that is clearly the most important batttery battleground. According to industry officials, battery makers spent $40 million on advertising just in the fourth quarter of 1986. Each year, the Christmas season, with its toys and gifts, makes the fourth quarter the biggest period for battery sales. **********While a price war does not appear imminent, cash rebates, coupons and bonus packs abound. Store aisles are crowded with battery displays. **********''Since Kodak entered, there have been so many displays everybody is tripping all over them,'' said the buying executive of a Chicago-based grocery chain, who asked not to be identified. Battery makers have been offering big discounts on the price retailers must pay for the displays, he said. The Effect on Profits **********The profit situation is mixed. Duracell, based in Bethel, Conn., is expected to report operating income for the last quarter of 1986 of about $54 million, down substantially from $82.6 million in 1985. Sales grew, to about $925 million, from $854 million in 1985. Duracell's earnings have been hurt by a third-quarter special charge of $26 million for closing South African operations, as well as other charges related to changes made at its plants. **********Duracell has also been suffering from discounted ''gray market'' sales in this country of batteries produced by its Belgian subsidiary that were intended for sale abroad. The problem was particularly acute before the dollar began dropping against European currencies. **********Eveready, on the other hand, expects a record year, but analysts say its promotion efforts will hurt its showing. Recently, Eveready added two free batteries to its four-pack of AA batteries and provided a free nine-volt battery with the purchase of another one. In 1985, the most recent year for which totals are available, Eveready reported operating income of $120 million on worldwide sales of $1 billion. **********So far, there is no sign that any of the battery makers are wavering in their competitive zeal. Kodak officials say the heavy advertising will continue for some time - industry officials are interpreting that to mean another year - or until it commands 15 percent of the market. Cooperative Tactic **********One tactic increasingly being used is cooperative marketing and promotional efforts with the makers of electronic devices. Eveready, for example, donated 80,000 battery-filled flashlights for the closing ceremonies of last year's July 4 festivities in New York. And until last year, Eveready played up the fact that Kodak had recommended Eveready batteries for Kodak cameras. **********Meanwhile, a new area of competition could open up as the battery makers work hard to perfect a lithium battery for widespread commercial use. Lithium batteries are now used in cameras and computers, but current technology does not allow them to be made in the common AA, C and D sizes. Compared with alkalines, lithium batteries deliver more power, have a longer shelf life and are less affected by temperature and moisture. **********''It offers some great possibilities,'' Ron B. Medinger, director of marketing for Eveready, said of lithium."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/23/world/aquino-demands-military-victory-over-insurgents.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1987-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 847, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AQUINO DEMANDS MILITARY VICTORY OVER INSURGENTS", "print_headline": "AQUINO DEMANDS MILITARY VICTORY OVER INSURGENTS", "body_text": " **********President Corazon C.

Last month, the Communist side refused to extend the two-month truce, and sharp fighting has resumed. **********At the same time, peace talks with Moslem rebels and with a small tribal insurgency in the Cordillera Mountains are deadlocked. In the last week, 108 people were reported killed in more than 30 clashes, making for what the Philippine News Agency called the bloodiest week since the Communists returned to the battlefield. The clashes included two rebel ambushes in which 37 soldiers were killed, and shootings of policemen in Manila. **********The bomb explosion Wednesday occurred at a dress rehearsal for today's ceremony.

Without the adjustment, some taxpayers will find too little is withheld, which could lead to penalties. Others will find the Government withholding too much of their pay. **********The new four-page W-4 package is twice as long as the old version. While much of the worksheet is fairly straightforward, some taxpayers may have difficulty estimating itemized deductions and other tax benefits for this year, and adjusting the figures to the new tax law. **********Q. Why is new W-4 form four pages long, instead of half a page, as in the past? **********A. The W-4 ''certificate'' that workers hand in to employers is still the same half-page length. It is the accompanying worksheet and instructions that have been expanded. Part of the reason is that the worksheet contains space for calculations that workers previously had to make on scratch paper. The Internal Revenue Service also felt that by making the form more comprehensive, taxpayers would be able to more accurately calculate the amount of withholding. **********Q. What is the deadline for filling out the forms? **********A. The official deadline is Oct. 1, but the I.R.S. and tax advisers recommend that individuals fill out the form as soon as possible. Q. Why the hurry?  A. Because workers may end up having too much or too little withheld from their weekly paycheck. If too little is withheld early in the year, they will have to request additional withholding later to compensate. That means living with smaller paychecks later in the year. If not enough tax is withheld during the year, the taxpayer may be subject to a penalty. **********Q. What happens if a taxpayer decides to avoid the hassle of filling out the worksheet and simply claims the same number of allowances as in the past? **********A. There is no hard and fast rule. After completing the worksheet, many people may well find that the proper amount of tax will be withheld if they claim the same number of withholding allowances as in the past. But many individuals, even those whose financial situation has not changed, will find otherwise. **********The reason is that the new law has made so many dramatic changes that affect the number of withholding allowances claimed. For one thing, the value of each withholding allowance - which is tied to the personal exemption - has been increased to $1,900 this year, from $1,080 last year. **********However, many of the tax benefits that allowed workers to claim extra withholding allowances on W-4's have been curtailed or eliminated. For example, many people who used to claim extra withholding allowances because they contributed to an Individual Retirement Account may not be able to claim them any longer because of new restrictions on I.R.A.'s. **********As a rule, the more withholding allowances claimed before, the more likely the withholding will be out of line now. **********Q. Can a worker claim as many allowances as desired? **********A. Workers can claim fewer withholding allowances than they are entitled to, but never more. The correct number can be found by filling out the worksheet. **********Q. Is there anything wrong with claiming too few withholding allowances, especially if a worker likes getting a big tax refund check each year. **********A. Most Americans do, in fact, get a refund, because they have more tax withheld than they owe. But electing to have much more money withheld than will ultimately be owed in taxes is a bad investment. The Government offers no rewards for being so diligent. ''Why would anyone want to give the Federal Government what is effectively an interest-free loan for one year by grossly overpaying?'' said Jack Salomon, a senior tax partner at the accounting firm of KMG Main Hurdman. **********Q. Should completed forms be sent to the I.R.S.? **********A. No. The completed form should be returned to employers. They will then adjust the amount withheld from paychecks based on the new number of withholding allowances. **********Q. Do workers give the employer the entire four-page form? **********A. No. They give the employer only the bottom portion of the first page, which is the ''Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate.'' The rest of the four-page worksheet should be kept for the taxpayer's records. The employer does not need it. **********Q. After employers make the proper adjustments to paychecks, is a copy of the W-4 sent to the I.R.S.? **********A. The employer is required to furnish a copy to the I.R.S. only if a worker claims more than 10 withholding allowances. The I.R.S. reserves the right to review these forms and is believed to do so on a random basis. A $500 penalty can be imposed if a worker tries to claim excess withholding allowances without a reasonable basis for doing so. **********Q. Once the form is handed in, can changes be made later? **********A. Yes. The number of withholding allowances can be changed anytime, by turning in a new W-4 to employers. **********Q. If a taxpayer is married and has a working spouse, should each fill out a separate worksheet and hand in a separate certificate to employers? **********A. Working couples filing jointly should fill out only one worksheet to figure the total number of withholding allowances to claim. The exemptions can be split between the two spouses in any fashion. **********But the I.R.S. and private tax practitioners recommend that the higher-earning spouse claim all the allowances and the lower-earning spouse claim none. By so doing, the total amount withheld from both paychecks will be more in line with the tax ultimately owed. **********Although only one worksheet is used in figuring a couple's withholding allowance, each spouse is required to turn in his or her own separate withholding certificate to the respective employer. **********Q. Is filling out the form as difficult as it looks? **********A. Taxpayers with very simple financial situations - such as one-income families with little investment income and few deductions to claim - will only need to fill out five lines of the form. The most difficult part of the form is estimating the amount of deductions to be claimed this year, taking into account the new law changes. **********Q. Starting from the beginning of the worksheet (on pages 3 and 4), what are the some of the more difficult items? **********A. On page three, line B, the term ''Special Allowance'' may be confusing, since there is no comparable item on income tax returns. It is merely an adjustment devised by the I.R.S. that will prevent certain taxpayers from having too much tax withheld from their pay based on the general withholding formula. The instructions on page 2 specifies who should claim the special allowance. **********Q. How do workers know if they need to complete more than the first five lines of the worksheet? **********A. Following line ''E'' on page 3 are clear and specific criteria as to whether a worker ''must'' or ''should'' complete the rest of the worksheet. If the worker fits the ''should'' category and chooses not to fill out the rest of the worksheet, he or she might have too much withheld from paychecks. This category consists of people who expect to claim special tax benefits, including itemized deductions, I.R.A. deductions and the child-care tax credit. Q. How does a worker estimate **********''adjustments'' on line F so early in the year and in light of the new tax changes? **********A. As a rule, workers can ignore ''qualified reimbursed employee business expenses,'' since the deduction will typically be offset by the cash reimbursement from employers, said William A. Crump, a tax manager at the accounting firm of Laventhol & Horwath. Besides, few people will be able to predict these amounts with any accuracy. **********As for ''qualified alimony payments,'' anyone with a divorce decree will know about how much they will have to pay their ex-spouse this year and whether it is deductible. **********''Business and investment losses'' are extremely difficult to estimate, particularly in light of the many changes made by the new tax law in these areas. Fortunately, most people with these losses rely on professional tax help. For those with tax shelter losses who do not go to a tax preparer, only 65 percent of these losses can be used to offset wages or other income in 1987 under the new law. **********''The penalty on early withdrawal of savings'' is usually a small item that can generally be ignored, since few people are likely to know if they will incur one of these penalties. **********As for ''qualified contributions to an I.R.A. account or Keogh plan,'' workers should list the amount to be contributed that will qualify for a deduction. They should keep in mind the new restrictions on I.R.A. deductions. **********Q. How about itemized deductions? **********''Medical expenses'' are obviously hard to predict. Any estimate is deductible only to the extent it exceeds 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. **********In computing ''state and local taxes,'' the figure on the 1986 return will help. To come up with a rough estimate. Mr. Crump recommends multiplying last year's state and local income tax liability by the percentage increase in wages this year. As a rule, taxpayers should keep real estate taxes even with last year. But they should not include sales taxes, since they are no longer deductible. **********In calculating interest deductions, taxpayers should bear in mind the new law's limits. Consumer interest, for example, is only 65 percent deductible in 1987. **********Mr. Crump said most people can probably ignore ''miscellaneous expenses,'' since most people do not have enough to qualify for a deduction anyway."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/10/world/the-summit-reporter-s-notebook-moscow-on-madison-ave.html": {"writer_name": "Maureen Dowd", "pub_date": "1987-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1463, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Summit; Reporter's Notebook: Moscow on Madison Ave.", "print_headline": "The Summit; Reporter's Notebook: Moscow on Madison Ave.", "body_text": " **********As East meets West this week, it is often difficult to discern who is winning the game of political exploitation. **********For his part, Mikhail S.

It's a hell of a P.R. show.'' **********But many American politicians are doing their best to use the Soviet leader to their advantage as well. **********Perhaps the best example is the Vice President, who has been invited to breakfast with Mr. Gorbachev at the Soviet Embassy on Thursday, along with a few of his friends. **********Several of the guests George Bush has chosen to take along just happen to be from Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two major primary states. **********Besides Mr Bush and his wife, Barbara; Secretary of State George P. Shultz and his wife, Helena, and Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, other guests at the breakfast for 10 include John H. Sununu, the Governor of New Hamphire and chairman of the Vice President's New Hampshire campaign; Cooper Evans, a former Republican Congressman from Iowa and a Bush supporter, and Robert Brooks, the principal of the Valley High School in West Des Moines. **********There were also published reports today that a camera crew from Mr. Bush's campaign would be joining the network crews, but the campaign refused to confirm or deny this report. **********''We feel like it is so blatantly political it defies description,'' said Kate Boyle, a press aide for Mr. Bush's major rival, Bob Dole. **********But Mr. Gorbachev is keeping track of all the possibilities for Ronald Reagan's successor, and so after a meeting with nine Congressional leaders at the embassy today, he pulled aside Mr. Dole - who has been ambivalent about the arms treaty -and talked with him privately for 10 minutes in an anteroom. As the Kansas Senator left, Mr. Gorbachev smiled and wished him good luck on his Presidential race. **********''Thank you,'' Mr. Dole replied. ''I'm winning.'' Jack Kemp's spokesman, John Buckley, said the New York Congressman was not feeling left out. ''This is the most skillful Soviet leader in many generations,'' Mr. Buckley said. ''He's skillful enough to know who will give up on the Strategic Defense Initiative and who he shouldn't waste his breath on.''  A Stern General Bends **********The stern facade of the security forces around Mr. Gorbachev cracked a little today in a heartwarming scene on the South Lawn of the White House. While the two world leaders were inside the White House palavering, Mr. Gorbachev's bodyguards and drivers were outside enjoying the uncommonly balmy Washington weather. **********Undaunted by the presence of a dozen armed men - and probably encouraged by the fact that President Reagan frequently feeds squirrels here with walnuts imported from Camp David - an American squirrel scampered up. A burly, gray-haired man in a black raincoat bent down to feed it some crumbs. **********The animal lover, who laughed and turned his back when a reporter asked for his name, was none other than Gen. Mikhail Tolkachayev, hero of the Battle of Stalingrad and now the head of Mr. Gorbachev's K.G.B. protective detail.  The Official's Two Lines **********On Day 3, some astringent commentary livened up the scene. **********Natan Sharansky, one of the founders of the Helsinki Watch Committee in Moscow, a human rights group, took issue with the comments of Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the Soviet press spokesman, that most of the Jews who wanted to leave the Soviet Union left in the 1970's. **********Mr. Sharansky, who served time in a Soviet prison on an espionage charge before he was released to the West, told a story intended to prove that the charming Mr. Gerasimov often offers the official Soviet line -whether or not he believes it. **********He said that Mr. Gerasimov and his wife had come to dinner at his parents' home in Russia years ago, just after Mr. Gerasimov had finished an American stint as a reporter for a Soviet journal, Literaturnaya Gazeta. **********''Mr. Gerasimov was saying at dinner how wonderful and what a great country the U.S. is, and how unhappy he was to come back to Moscow,'' Mr. Sharansky said. ''At the same time, the articles by Mr. Gerasimov were about how awful life in America was. **********''In order to stay and enjoy life in America, he had to publish articles about how awful it was. Today, to enjoy life as a Soviet official, he is ready to say all kinds of ridiculous things.''  Raisa Gorbachev, in Brief **********Will wonders never cease? The first official biography of Raisa Gorbachev - all five sentences of it -was released by the Soviet Information Center today. **********The biography was characteristically cryptic but was snapped up by Kremlinologists who have been kept in the dark on even the simplest facts about the Soviet First Lady. **********Although Mrs. Gorbachev recently answered a question posed to her in Russia recently about where she was born by saying merely ''in Russia,'' this profile reports for the first time that she comes from Siberia. She was born in the city of Rubtsovsk, and her father was a Russian railway worker. **********The profile confirms widespread reports that Mrs. Gorbachev holds the equivalent of an American master's degree in sociology, that she graduated from Moscow State University, which her husband attended, and that she has taught at Soviet institutes of higher education. **********It mentions her only official position, a member of the Presidium of the Board of the Soviet Cultural Foundation, and concludes with the brief note that ''she has an adult daughter.'' This daughter is not mentioned on the biography released at the same time for Mr. Gorbachev - not because the daughter is not his, but because Russians regard family as properly a matter for a female fact sheet. **********Sovietologists are still left to argue about her age - 53 or 55 - and about when she met and married her husband.  Caviar Without Vodka **********Since the Russians believe in teetotaling these days, at least officially, vodka was not on the menu for the reciprocal dinner at the Soviet Embassy tonight. But a Soviet diplomat broke the veil of secrecy about the dinner to confide, ''It would be considered a travesty if we didn't serve caviar.'' **********For weeks the embassy staff has been busy repainting and refurbishing the 1909 Beaux-Arts-style mansion five blocks from the White House. Dinner took place in the glittering grand ballroom amid the gold leaf pilasters, ornately carved moldings, magnificent chandeliers and damask-draped windows. **********Pamela Harriman, who will be entertaining Mrs. Gorbachev at her Georgetown home on Thursday, was there, along with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, Howard H. Baker Jr., chief of staff to the President, and Armand Hammer, the industrialist and philanthropist who has both business and cultural interests in the Soviet Union. Mr. Hammer hit the summit jackpot - he is one of the rare Americans without ''official'' status who received invitations to both the White House and Soviet dinners. **********The entire block has been closed to pedestrians and cars all week, but Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci said that posed no problem for him. ''One of the things about this job,'' he said, ''is that you get to ride with people who take care of those kind of things for you.''

The absence of sprinklers in guest rooms, fire protection experts said, is a glaring deficiency in hotel safety measures and could result in future fires and needless deaths. **********Since that survey, fire codes in a few cities and states have been tightened to require sprinklers in newly constructed hotels. But still fewer of the new laws require existing hotel owners to go to the considerable expense of ''retrofitting'' existing hotels with sprinkler systems. **********In the absence of such requirements, fire experts do not foresee significant sprinkler coverage for several more years. Installation of sprinkler systems is a costly investment that many in the lodging industry continue to avoid. And that, fire protection specialists warn, could be a serious and costly mistake. **********''Had there been sprinklers in the area where the fire started at the Dupont Plaza Hotel, it would never have gotten out of that room,'' said John A. Viniello, president of the Patterson, N.Y.-based National Fire Sprinkler Assocation, which sent an investigating team to San Juan. ''The fire would either have been extinguished by the sprinklers or slowed enough so that people could have escaped.'' Like numerous states, Puerto Rico does not require hotels to install sprinkler systems. But a sprinkler system installed during construction can cost between $1.25 and $1.50 a square foot, and retrofitting existing hotels with a system can cost even more - from $2 to $2.50 a square foot, according to Mr. Viniello. That's a huge disincentive to an owner of a hotel with hundreds of thousands of square feet to worry about protecting. **********To help defray the expense, some states, including New Jersey and Alaska, provide tax incentives. Moreover, a number of large hotel chains have decided to bear the cost themselves, either in response to changes in local fire codes or to foster a reputation as a safe place to stay. **********''We think it is good business,'' said Robert T. Souers, a spokesman for the Marriott Corporation, which began installing sprinkler systems in its 164 hotels five years ago and has completed 90 percent of the hotels. Though the cost is ''substantial,'' he said, ''it makes for a safer environment'' that guests increasingly demand. **********Similarly, the Hilton Hotel chain has directed managers of its 300 hotels to install sprinklers by the end of the year, according to Henry Moore, fire protection manager for the chain. He said the effort would cost ''millions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/03/business/advertising-ad-pages-increase.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1987-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ad Pages Increase", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Ad Pages Increase", "body_text": " **********The Publishers Information Bureau said advertising pages for its magazine members had risen 2 percent, to 14,756, in September from a year earlier, while revenues had increased 2.3 percent, to $485.8 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/06/world/bomb-near-official-s-homes-in-cape-town-injures-woman.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOMB NEAR OFFICIAL'S HOMES IN CAPE TOWN INJURES WOMAN", "print_headline": "BOMB NEAR OFFICIAL'S HOMES IN CAPE TOWN INJURES WOMAN", "body_text": " **********A bomb blasted the roof off a bus shelter today about 330 yards from President P.

Skinner; A Chicago Surgeon Takes a Tough Case in New York", "print_headline": "NEW YORK HOSPITAL'S NEW CHIEF: Dr. David B. Skinner; A Chicago Surgeon Takes a Tough Case in New York", "body_text": " **********THE new medical economics is rewriting the book on hospital management - and managers. **********Two years ago, when the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center began a search for an administrator rather than a doctor to succeed its retiring director, ''the medical staff had its own case of cardiac arrest,'' said one New York physician. **********As a result, it was the doctors, not the administrators, who first approached Dr. David B. Skinner, a leading Chicago surgeon, to replace Dr. David D. Thompson, who will retire as head of New York Hospital this fall, at the age of 65. **********The doctors' sensitivty is not surprising: Tensions are rising generally between administrators and staff doctors as the nation's hospitals undergo painful cost-cutting to survive the stricter Medicare and private-insurance reimbursement plans in effect these days. **********Dr. Skinner, chief of surgery at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Clinics, may have the support of the medical staff at New York Hospital when he takes over on Oct. 1. But he will still have plenty of problems. **********Running a big, private, nonprofit hospital is very similar to running a corporation - though it can be even more complicated. Like corporations, hospitals must carefully manage cash flow and raise long-term funds for major projects. But the facilities cannot always seek to maximize their returns - if they fail to provide services to the community, such as health care for the indigent, they can lose their tax-exempt status. **********Hospitals are also labor-intensive, and dealing with personnel is perhaps the most difficult task for an administrator. There are the doctors, who channel patients to the hospital. There are the nurses, who work in a context of a severe nationwide shortage. Then come the technicians - also hard to hold on to - and other skilled and non-skilled workers who are often unionized. **********An administrator must also deal with regulatory authorities, a task considered especially difficult in New York because of unusually tough regulations and standards. In the wake of a state moratorium on hospital expansion in 1983 and subsequent legal difficulties, for example, New York Hospital has been waiting years for permission from state authorities to rebuild its main hospital. **********And in an era of rapidly changing health-care economics, a director has to develop a long-term strategy. Such strategies have increasingly involved affiliations with other hospitals, but while these can produce economies of scale, designing a network of hospitals and getting them to work together harmoniously can be a sensitive and difficult undertaking. **********Dr. Skinner - whose strengths may lie more in medicine and administration than in diplomacy - will face most of these challenges at New York Hospital. **********For one thing, the new reimbursement system does not account for the expense of providing the specialized services offered by teaching hospitals: New York Hospital runs the nation's biggest burn-treatment center, operates one of the most sophisticated neo-natal care units, and is a leader in cardiovascular medicine. **********Other problems come with the post, too. For the past three years, a series of medical mishaps has been eroding the prestige of the venerable, 216-year-old institution - New York's City's oldest hospital and the largest private, nonprofit health facility in New York State. In a 1984 case, a grand jury ruled that ''woefully'' inadequate care and repeated medical mistakes led to the hospital death of 18-year-old Libby Zion, admitted with a high fever. In 1985, the facility had to adopt written policies regarding lifesaving measures following the death of an 87-year-old woman who, the family claimed, was not terminally ill. Last February, the New York State Health Department charged that inadequate care was given to artist Andy Warhol, who died at the hospital after routine gall bladder surgery. Two months ago, a power failure that blacked out 20 percent of the huge Manhattan complex led to the death of a critically ill infant on a respirator. **********Dr. Skinner describes the headline-grabbing events as ''troubling.'' But he says such developments are not unique to New York Hospital and that the problems are being resolved. His main concerns, he says, are much bigger - nothing less than the evolution of the nation's health-care system. The lure of running New York Hospital was too much to resist, Dr. Skinner says, because what happens at this huge and prestigious hospital has a bearing on the rapidly changing health-care system. **********''I was successful in building a strong surgery department that is recognized nationally and internationally,'' he said. But at New York Hospital, ''I can do more for modern medicine.'' **********NOT exactly modest talk. But Dr. Skinner, an imposing figure with a strong and confident voice, is not one for false modesty. **********Asked for some biographical material during an interview in his office at the University of Chicago Hospitals, the 52-year-old native of Joliet, Ill., supplied a 42-page, single-spaced sheaf of facts. **********Among the credentials listed: a B.A. earned ''with high distinction'' from the University of Rochester, a ''cum laude'' medical degree from Yale, a series of surgical appointments at such top-notch institutions as Massachusetts General, Johns Hopkins and Bethesda Naval Medical Center, 13 honors and awards; memberships in 31 societies and on 12 boards; a dozen journal editorships; service on a dozen advisory panels. And that is just through page 6. **********As head of surgery at University of Chicago Hospitals since 1972, Dr. Skinner, a thoracic surgeon, has been deeply involved in administration, said Dr. Harry W. Schoenberg, a surgeon who is president of the hospital's medical staff. ''Because of the strength of his personality, he has the self-confidence that allows him to see all sides of a problem, not just his own perspective,'' he said. **********His reputation for building a great surgery department stems mainly from his ability to attract top talent. ''He brought in a lot of people who have made important contributions,'' said Dr. Schoenberg. **********Dr. Skinner's almost total absorption in medicine extends into his family life, too. When his oldest daughter, Linda, graduated from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine - two of his four daughters are becoming doctors - he wrote her a letter in which he outlined his views on the health-care system. Later he used the letter as the basis for a speech before the Chicago Surgical Society. Such a strong drive and personality may be what is needed at New York Hospital these days. But the assurance that Dr. Skinner projects has also resulted in a reputation for being autocratic and a bit arrogant. **********Some in Chicago say these traits were responsible for a breakdown in negotiations last year of a merger between the University of Chicago Hospitals and Michael Reese Hospital, another large and respected Chicago facility. **********Doctors say the talks were terminated after a memo written by Dr. Skinner leaked out to the medical community. The memo reportedly urged that the deal be closed so that the merged hospital could get rid of the ''butchers'' at Michael Reese. **********Dr. Skinner denies that he ever wrote that, but the rumors persist in Chicago's medical community. **********Always a tough bargainer, Dr. Skinner refused to accept the job at New York Hospital until the facility gave in to his demands for full administrative authority. As a result, he will hold the new post of president and chief executive officer. Dr. Thompson holds the title of director. **********The difference in titles is significant, says Robert Hatfield, chairman of the hospital's board of governors and retired chairman of Continental Can. Under Dr. Thompson, the board had considerable say in the hospital's affairs, he said. In creating the position of president and chief executive, the board has ''put all authority in Dr. Skinner's hands,'' he added. **********Dr. Skinner is already considering some new strategies at New York Hospital - including the acquisition of smaller, lower-cost hospitals in the region. These would handle the more routine - and less expensive - work, and channel the more difficult cases to New York Hospital, explains Dr. Skinner. Profits produced by the smaller units would then be used to subsidize New York Hospital. **********Despite its big endowments and its reputation for top-quality financial management, the hospital could use the financial boost in an era when it is cutting costs: The facility plans to cut the number of its beds by more than 6 percent, to 1,026 from 1,096. **********Another project Dr. Skinner is considering could also bring in revenues - setting up a hospital-affiliated H.M.O-like group practice in which patients pay set annual fees. **********Dr. Skinner does not favor all types of H.M.O.'s, especially those owned by doctors themselves. In such groups, he says, if profits are the result of efficiency, ''that's fine.'' But he fears that the quest for profits might mean that ''patients may not be satisfactorily cared for.'' **********Patient care is also his priority, he says, when it comes to running a teaching hospital. New York Hospital works intimiatley with Cornell Medical College, but Dr. Skinner says the two are distinct and that his responsibility is the hospital. ''A university puts research and teaching first,'' he said. ''The hospital has a clear mission to put the patient first.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/24/world/russians-say-estonian-could-seek-a-pardon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 274, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russians Say Estonian Could Seek a Pardon", "print_headline": "Russians Say Estonian Could Seek a Pardon", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union said today that Karl Linnas, who was deported here from the United States on Monday, could appeal for pardon from the death sentence for war crimes that was passed by a Soviet court in his absence. **********Boris Pyadyshev, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a briefing that such an appeal could be submitted to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the equivalent of a collective national presidency, which is headed by Andrei A.

Speech in Washington **********Mr. Tambo is scheduled to deliver an address in Washington on Jan. 28 and meet with some Congressional leaders. He is expected to confer with Mr. Shultz at the same time. **********The report portrays the South African Communist Party as having aligned itself with the popular rebel movement principally for opportunistic reasons. **********''The South African Communist Party, banned since 1950, lacks a mass following but has exercised considerable influence through its alliance with the African National Congress,'' according to the study. ''The S.A.C.P. continues to view its historical alliance with the A.N.C. as its main hope for winning power in South Africa.'' **********The study says the South African Communist Party has persuaded Moscow that an alliance with the African National Congress is the best hope for achieving influence in South Africa. ''Moscow has long shared the S.A.C.P.'s assessment of the A.N.C. as the major potential catalyst for political change and it hopes to steer the A.N.C. in directions favorable to Soviet interest,'' it says. 'Deeply Beholden to Soviet' **********The department report said, ''The A.N.C. is deeply beholden to the S.A.C.P. and the Soviet Union for the arms and training that made possible the upsurge in guerrilla activity that has boosted its prestige in South Africa in recent years. **********''Dependence on Moscow for military assistance will continue to entrench Party influence in the A.N.C. and its strong representation in the A.N.C. hierarchy.'' **********The report also says there is considerable cross-membership between the rebel organization and the South African Communist Party.

Heileman's stock jumped to well over that price, however, indicating Wall Street thinks Bond will have to raise its bid. **********And Mr. Cleary, who has a reputation as a tough maverick in the industry, would not be expected to yield his company without a protracted battle. **********''At $38, frankly, he would be crazy to accept the bid,'' said an industry analyst, George S. Dahlman of Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc., in Minneapolis. A price of $45 a share would be more like it, he said. **********Mr. Cleary is a personable yet aggressive marketer, Mr. Dahlman said, adding that Heileman might be a bit thin in management because Mr. Cleary did most things himself. **********The letter to Mr. Cleary from Alan Bond, the chairman of the Australian bidder, assured him that management would stay in place and asked him to check with Pittsburgh Brewing, a recent Bond acquisition, to find how well things might go under Bond. **********Mr. Cleary built Heileman from the 15th-largest brewer to fourth place after Anheuser-Busch, Philip Morris's Miller and Stroh Brewery, largely by developing aggressive regional brands, such as Old Style, Black Label and Lone Star. The company would have been bigger yet had Mr. Cleary been successful in his attempts to acquire the Pabst Brewing Company and Schlitz, moves that were blocked by antitrust objections. **********Mr. Cleary entered the beer business after marrying the daughter of Heileman's chairman, Roy E. Kumm. That was back when Mr. Cleary was a law student at the University of Wisconsin. When he graduated, he practiced law and went into real estate in La Crosse, Wis., his hometown and the headquarters of Heileman. In 1960, Mr. Kumm asked him to join Heileman, and when Mr. Kumm died unexpectedly in 1971, Mr. Cleary took over the business leadership at the age of 36. **********Heileman became a potential takeover target, analysts say, when its acquisition strategy recently began to falter, with its market share falling and profits shrinking.

The strait separates the island nation and India. Officials met here late tonight to discuss the handling of the situation. Certain to Cause Concern **********Indian officials emphasized that the current move was stricly nonmilitary and that it continued to support the territorial unity of Sri Lanka. But the action was certain to cause concern in Pakistan and other countries distrustful of Indian motives. **********Indian officials said Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had decided to act because of anger that the President of Sri Lanka, J. R. Jayewardene, had ignored his appeals to stop the military offensive and allow India to resume its mediation of the war. **********In a statement, India cited Sri Lanka's claim that its ''all-out military assault'' was ''a fight to the finish'' and that it had subjected civilians to ''sustained strafing and bombing'' and tried ''to keep this tragic story from the world.'' The statement said India was inviting reporters to accompany its mission so they could verify reports of ''large-scale civilian deaths.'' **********An Indian official said tonight that a convoy of 20 ships would go to the northern Jaffna Peninsula on Wednesday, a distance of about 30 miles, and that the Indian Red Cross would distribute food and medicine. It said that the convoy would be unarmed and accompanied by no armed vessels, and that the mission would not be postponed or negotiated with Colombo. **********The Government here reacted with surprise and caution, saying the move was unnecessary and uncalled for. But officials said that if New Delhi wanted to send assistance, it should do so only after consulting with Sri Lanka.

She rolled onto her port side less than a mile offshore, tumbling passengers, autos and trucks as the ocean rushed in. **********Officials of the ferry company have said it was a common practice to leave open the bow doors, which normally are nine feet above the water line, long enough to ventilate exhaust fumes from the boat's cavernous vehicle decks. **********Mr. Moore, however, told the House of Commons that the Government was re-emphasizing current requirements that all openings in a ferry's superstructure and hull be closed by the crew ''before they proceed to sea.'' **********He said the initial inquiry found no structural flaws in the ferry, but he did not comment on theories that the boat capsized because of a combination of slipshod procedures involving the open doors and an improper distribution of ballast that lowered the bow and put the doorway dangerously close to the waterline. **********The Belgian Government has already begun an inquiry that includes the option to make recommendations on whether criminal charges should be brought in the accident. Captain Still in Shock **********The captain of the boat, identified as David Lewry, remained in shock with a collapsed lung and was unable to answer questions about the capsizing, company officials said. **********The opposition Labor Party rose in Commons to stress that the inquiry must focus on whether commercial pressures in the busy ferry industry between Britain and the Continent compromised safety by emphasizing rapid turnaround measures. Truck drivers who are veterans of the ferry run said it was not unusual to see a boat's doors still open as it headed across the inner harbor toward the open sea. **********The Herald is of the rapid-loading ''roll on, roll off'' design that minimizes interior bulkheads; her interior resembles a hangar. Some critics have said this design was a contributing factor in the disaster. Others have asserted that the large tractor-trailer rigs on the boat were not sufficiently tied down and thus aggravated the deadly imbalance, crashing to port as the boat began to list. **********''I share the grief and anguish of those who are bereaved,'' Mr. Moore said. Identifications Continue **********Family members journeyed to a gymnasium morgue in Zeebrugge to identify the 53 bodies recovered thus far. The bodies of another 81 victims are presumed trapped within the boat, which rests in 30 feet of water, her port half fully submerged. **********There has been growing criticism that it may take weeks to recover the bodies because of the nature of the salvage operation, a technique of attaching cables to the hull, hauling it upright and pumping out water to keep it afloat. **********Company officials stressed that their first priority was recovering the bodies and not keeping the boat in one piece for future service. Other methods, such as cutting open the hull, would be less efficient in terms of retrieving the bodies, they said. **********The British tabloids were busily buying up survivors' tales, hailing reputed heroes and heroines and focusing on small children orphaned by the disaster.

Mr. Reagan is also scheduled to see Pope John Paul II. **********Mr. Cossiga had been widely expected to ask Mr. Fanfani to form for the first time what is described here as an ''institutional government,'' meaning that it consists of ministers from only one party, in addition to several senior civil servants, with the sole purpose of preparing the vote, which will take place about a year earlier than the next regularly scheduled parliamentary election. **********The choice fell to Mr. Fanfani, officials close to the President's office said, because he occupies, as incumbent President of the Senate, or upper house of Parliament, the second highest position by protocal within the republic and is broadly viewed as a neutral figure. **********It is the sixth time Mr. Fanfani, a law professor, has led an Italian Government. **********None of the other parties in the former five-party Cabinet headed by Mr. Craxi, which also included Socialists, Republicans, Liberals and Social Democrats, agreed to send ministers. **********The Government's crisis was largely a result of political infighting between Mr. Craxi's Socialists and the Christian Democrats, the largest party in the former Cabinet with roughly 60 percent of its parliamentary support. **********The Christian Democrats insisted that the other four parties abide by an accord reached last summer to hand the office of Prime Minister to someone of their party this year, but the Socialists pressed for early elections, hoping to parlay Mr. Craxi's achievements and popularity as Prime Minister into electoral gains."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/28/business/india-hints-at-talks-on-bhopal-suit.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1987-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 318, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "India Hints At Talks on Bhopal Suit", "print_headline": "India Hints At Talks on Bhopal Suit", "body_text": " **********The Government of India, apparently willing to resume negotiations, declared today that it was ready for a ''just and fair'' settlement with the Union Carbide Corporation over compensation for victims of the 1984 gas-leak tragedy at Bhopal. **********In a statement before a court at Bhopal, in central India, a senior lawyer for the Government said it wanted a settlement of their claims that would be ''just and fair and reasonable to all parties concerned.''

Col. Oliver L. North told a meeting of mid-level Government officials last August that he was giving money to contra leaders and running an air resupply operation that used C-123 aircraft, according to handwritten notes he took at the time. **********According to officials who have seen the notes, which have been turned over to the Congressional select committees investigating the Iran-contra affair, they suggest that Colonel North told State Department, Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon officials of his contra operations months before a C-123 transport plane was shot down over Nicaragua Oct. 5. **********The disclosure is potentially significant because several Cabinet officers and other senior Reagan Administration officials, including Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams, emphatically insisted at the time that they knew of no United States Government connection to the downed plane. **********Later, Mr. Abrams said the inaccurate statements had stemmed from an incomplete knowledge of Colonel North's activities. Testimony About Meeting **********Last week, Colonel North testified he had attended a Pentagon meeting in August in which he gave mid-level officials a detailed account of some of his activities in support of the contras. At the time, Congress had approved $100 million for the rebels but had not released the money. **********Colonel North testified that he probably mentioned the air operation he was directing. He said, however, that he was uncertain precisely what he said and urged the committee to review his handwritten notes. **********Government officials who have seen the notes say they show that Colonel North attended a meeting at the Pentagon Aug. 28 and described payments to contra leaders, the air operation and its use of C-123 planes. **********Attending, Colonel North testified, were Lieut. Gen. John Moellring, a special assistant to the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff; Mr. Abrams and his senior aide, James Michel; Alan D. Fiers, head of the C.I.A.'s Central America task force, and Richard Armitage, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. Denial From Abrams **********Mr. Abrams said today that he had not attended the meeting, and there was no indication in Colonel North's notes that he did. ''On Aug. 28, 1986, I was on vacation with my family,'' he said. ''I do not recall ever being told that a meeting took place in my absence at which a detailed description of the private air operations was made or that salary payments to individual resistence leaders were discussed.'' **********Mr. Fiers has insisted to investigators that he knew nothing about Colonel North's role in the resupply effort, and a C.I.A. spokesman had no comment. General Moellring has retired and could not be reached. The Pentagon said it was not commenting on the hearings, and Mr. Armitage was out of town. **********A State Department spokesman said Mr. Michel attended the meeting, but that he had no comment on what took place. **********A State Department official said Mr. Michel had given Mr. Abrams an account of the August meeting after it took place. This official said Mr. Abrams was unaware of Colonel North's possibly questionable activities, including his role in the air operations, until they were publicly disclosed. A Sensitive Operation **********''We went down item by item on my check list,'' Colonel North testified last week, adding that he ''asked them point-blank whether this should continue.'' **********The support payments to the contra leaders that Colonel North mentioned to the other officials were among the Administration's more sensitive operations on behalf of the rebels. The rebel leaders initially received payments from the C.I.A., but those payments were cut off in early 1985 after the Congressional intelligence committees pointed out that some of those receiving support were giving speeches in the United States and lobbying Congress on behalf of the contras. Members said they objected to any C.I.A. operation that could influence American public opinion. The C.I.A. had no comment today.  A document released by the committee last week, a 1985 letter from Colonel North to the contra leader Adolfo Calero, shows that the colonel's payments to another contra leader, Arturo Cruz Jr., began after fears arose that members of Congress would publicly disclose that Mr. Cruz was on the payroll of what the document called ''the company.'' **********Government officials confirmed this was a reference to C.I.A. money previously funnelled to Mr. Cruz, payments that were being made even in 1984, when he was briefly a candidate for President in Nicaragua. **********The complete document was made public by the committee last week. In it, Colonel North wrote: ''We may have to very soon assume the cost of what the company is providing to Arturo. You and I both recognize his value and limitations. Some in our Congress are aware the company is paying him and have threatened to expose the connection. This could be devastating to our forthcoming campaign to restore the funding. I will find out soon how much he is getting and let you know, but it seems as though something should be set aside for this purpose.'' **********Mr. Cruz was one of three directors of the contra movement in mid-1985 and resigned this year. He has acknowledged that in December 1985, Colonel North offered him support payments and that he received about $7,000 per month from January to November. Earlier this year, he resigned from the contra directorate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/26/business/after-the-fall-fidelity-regroups.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallace", "pub_date": "1987-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1184, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "After the Fall, Fidelity Regroups", "print_headline": "After the Fall, Fidelity Regroups", "body_text": " **********More than any other financial services company, Fidelity Investments has promoted the love affair between investors and mutual funds. During the last five years, Fidelity's selection of funds has more than tripled, to more than 100, and its assets under management jumped to $85 billion, from $19 billion. **********Fidelity customers can turn to one of nearly three dozen sector funds, which invest in stocks in industries including electronics, chemicals, housing or brokerages. For more variety, they can invest in international stock and bond funds. And if customers want to play it safe, more than 20 money market funds are available. Challenges Since October **********But Fidelity is facing tough challenges, largely stemming from the stock market collapse in October. The burden of grappling with these problems belongs to Edward C. Johnson 3d, the current chairman, whose family has controlled the firm since its founding in 1946. **********As Mr. Johnson put it, ''From the current trend of sales, the general public seems to be discouraged'' with investments in equity funds. **********No longer are individual investors so eager to thrust their money at Fidelity's high-performing stock funds. The assets of its equity funds have risen to $27 billion, from $4 billion in 1982, but the sales pace is now about half what it was before the stock market plunged on Oct. 19. **********During the market collapse, Fidelity stood out among institutional investors for the impact that its huge stock sales had on the market. Mr. Johnson admitted that Fidelity's stock transactions on Oct. 19 were triple their normal volume. Fidelity said it intends to increase its bank lines of credit to avoid the need to execute large sell orders when customer redemptions run high. **********Fidelity's once-envied customer service operation also faltered on Oct. 19. The firm, considered by competitors to be one of the premier service organizations, disappointed many of its customers who were delayed in getting through clogged telephone lines when they were most desperate to make a change in their holdings. **********What happened to Fidelity in October is significant because the mutual fund firm, because of its size and the variety of its products, serves as a window on the financial services industry. Since taking over as chairman from his father in 1972, Mr. Johnson, 56 years old, has built the firm into a financial powerhouse with estimated revenues of $800 million. Fidelity now has 54 investor centers in major metropolitan areas nationwide. Shrewd Marketing Tactics **********Its shrewd marketing approach, in fact, has made Fidelity the Procter & Gamble of the financial business. Besides offering the broadest array of funds, Fidelity inundates investors with information, with offerings that range from video cassettes on tax planning to a magazine that promotes the firm's products and provides financial planning advice. **********Although it is best known for its mutual funds, Fidelity also offers a discount brokerage, real estate investments, a cash management account and other financial services. At the end of November, 47 percent of the $75 billion in managed assets was invested in money market accounts, 38 percent was in stock funds and 15 percent was in bond funds. **********To deal with the effects of the stock market collapse, Mr. Johnson and his staff have adopted new marketing tactics to keep money coming in. **********With investors skittish about equities, Fidelity has cut back on its advertising of stock funds and has stepped up promotion of the high-income features of bond and money-market funds. In addition, Fidelity is offering commission-free trades to people who sell stocks and switch their assets into a Fidelity fund. Fixing the Phones **********Fidelity executives have also been working to correct operational problems, like the overburdened telephone system. **********Customers normally must wait no longer than 19 seconds for a representative to answer the phone, but on the three peak trading days starting Friday, Oct. 16, they had to wait up to four minutes, Mr. Johnson said. Some customers reported waits of much longer. **********''We were not pleased with our ability to handle the volume,'' he said. ''Too many people had to wait too long.'' **********Mr. Johnson has taken steps to insure that Fidelity could handle a volume of calls similar to the hundreds of thousands that poured into the firm's phone centers on Oct. 19 and 20. **********The firm said that the number of incoming lines has been increased by 50 percent and that 200 staff members have been trained for emergencies to help out the 1,500 men and women who handle telephone customers full-time. **********''We just did not envisage that kind of volume,'' Mr. Johnson said of the October experience. ''We were just wrong on that particular issue.'' Assets Down $10 Billion **********Although sales of shares in stock mutual funds have dropped, redemptions from the funds have apparently not posed a problem. The privately held firm does not reveal redemption figures, but Mr. Johnson said they were in line with overall industry withdrawals, which have been considered relatively small. Since October, Fidelity's total managed assets declined to $75 billion, from $85 billion, mostly because of the drop in the value of the stocks it holds. **********Even if the broad market crumbles, Mr. Johnson said he believed that his firm would be able to sell shares in the 32 sector funds that invest in specific industries. Since Fidelity, which pioneered these volatile funds, offers such a variety of them, Mr. Johnson reasons that some are bound to outperform the industry averages. ''I would think we would continue to market them somewhat aggressively,'' he said. **********However, Mr. Johnson indicated that Fidelity would remain attuned to the marketplace, adding that the firm would drop one campaign and create another if it found individual investors do not want sector funds - or for that matter, any type of fund. **********''If people don't want to buy them, we're certainly not going to spend a lot of money on advertising,'' he said. ''If people express considerable interest, we'll continue to market them.'' **********Should stock prices fall further, Fidelity will obviously suffer. But its range of products should position it to survive in any economic environment. Mr. Johnson recalls the difficulties that sprang from the bear market in stocks in 1973 and the following years. When individuals avoided stocks, Fidelity developed money market and tax-exempt bond funds to entice them. As a result, the firm became an industry leader in those areas, too. **********''We lived sparsely, but we lived well between 1974 and 1981 when no matter how hard we tried to sell equities, we could hardly sell a share,'' he said. ''If the same situation comes back again, we will adapt.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/12/business/robins-has-new-plan-for-claims.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 294, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Robins Has New Plan For Claims", "print_headline": "Robins Has New Plan For Claims", "body_text": " **********The A.

Earlier, the company had argued that there should be no punitive damages and that any leftover money belonged to it and not to the claimants. **********The schedule of proposed payments, running from $200 to $3,000 for the simpler claims, has also been dropped, with a new schedule to be designated by the trustees."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/01/business/credit-markets-guarded-optimism-on-bonds.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1987-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1033, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Guarded Optimism on Bonds", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Guarded Optimism on Bonds", "body_text": " **********Treasury bond yields have dropped sharply the last 11 days, though traders acknowledge that the new-found optimism may have fragile underpinnings. **********The decline in 30-year government bond yields to 8.64 percent on Friday from 9.05 percent on May 21 was the most significant since yields began rising from 7.55 percent on March 26. Investor demand for bonds has been modest, traders said, but demand has improved sharply from securities dealers and other speculators who were aggressively selling bonds during April and most of May. **********''The improvement in the dollar and the unwinding of some commodity prices have removed some of the inflation fear that was such a negative for the market,'' said William S. Coleman, director of government bond trading at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. At the same time, he said, ''there are definitely more buyers, including some nibbling from overseas'' and a cessation of the heavy selling by bond mutual funds that depressed the market during April and most of May. The Volcker Question **********The major risk in the market now, Mr. Coleman said, is the question of whether Paul A. Volcker will be reappointed chairman of the Federal Reserve. His term expires in August, and rumors about his reappointment or departure circulate almost daily in the bond market. Traders expect his retirement from the board would push both dollar and bond prices lower, while his reappointment would lift both markets. **********Expectations about the summit meeting of industrial powers in Venice next week vary widely. Some securities dealers said that the improvement in the dollar during the past month (from a low of about 137 yen to 144 yen Friday), plus the moves toward lower short-term rates in Japan and West Germany and higher rates in the United States, are good reasons for not expecting any major new initiatives. Friday's announcement by the Japanese Government of a new spending plan, larger than expected, was another needed change in policy, they said. **********But others said the improvement in the dollar has occurred precisely because new initiatives are expected. Without some tangible follow-through at Venice, they predicted the dollar would again weaken and there might be renewed upward pressure on American interest rates in order to attract foreign capital. **********''If the policies implemented are believable, then the decline in bond yields is sustainable, and there will be a reversal of the recent pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy,'' said William Sullivan, senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.''But if the summit breaks up with a general statement agreeing that the appropriate policies are already in place, then the dollar could weaken and upward pressure on rates would re-emerge.'' Dollar Seen as Vulnerable **********Thomas Campbell, vice president and foreign exchange trader at the First National Bank of Chicago, predicted that even if the foreign exchange and bond markets are stable through the summit, the dollar would still be vulnerable. ''If the April trade data show too large a deficit,'' he said, ''then people might again say, 'It doesn't matter what comes out of the summit, the economics show the dollar has to come down.' '' **********The merchandise trade deficit of $13.6 billion in March was down from $15.1 billion in February. But even if the trade deficit continues to shrink in coming months, contributing to faster growth in gross national product (as it did in the first quarter), some analysts worry that the improvement will be too slow to stave off protectionist legislation that will raise inflation and too little to prevent another round of dollar devaluation in the foreign exchange markets. **********A recent study by economists at the Deutsche Bank, for example, concluded that even if the American trade deficit declines this year and next, the present level of the dollar suggests that the deficit might begin rising later, once the effects of the recent dollar devaluation are exhausted. **********''The persistent U.S. external deficit and the unprecedented overhang of dollars will remain major depressants on the dollar's exchange value for years to come,'' the study said. The remedy, the bank said, is economic policy coordination among nations that would enable them to quickly correct large trade surpluses and deficits. **********Besides the inflationary impact of a weaker dollar, the bond market pays close attention to foreign exchange developments because the Federal Reserve in April showed it was willing to raise short-term interest rates to make the dollar more attractive. Rate Rise Seen as Temporary Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, noted last week that higher interest rates are not in the best interest of the world economy and not the true preference of the Federal Reserve. At a luncheon for institutional investors, he predicted that the Fed's use of higher interest rates to defend the dollar ''will not really persist for a long period of time.'' **********The First Boston analyst said that a financial crisis or the accumulation of signs of weak economic growth are two developments that would cause the Fed to shift its focus away from the dollar and back to domestic affairs. Alternatively, he said, agreements reached at the Venice summit meeting next week might foster enough stability in the foreign exchange markets that the Fed might no longer find it necessary to use higher interest rates as a tool to maintain the dollar's value. **********Developments that would promote stability in the dollar, Mr. Soss said, include the reappointment of Paul A. Volcker as chairman of the Fed, repeal of some recently imposed tariffs, arranging for Japan to increase its investments and lending to Latin America, stimulation of the Japanese and West German economies, and some reduction in the American budget deficit.

But Wall Street sources, who asked not to be identified, said Henley had no interest in Owens-Illinois, feeling that Kohlberg, Kravis's bid has already made the company too expensive. **********Mr. Dingman, who was formerly the head of Wheelbrator-Frye before it merged with the Signal Companies, resigned from Allied-Signal's board of directors as part of the buyback agreement. **********He also said that some of Wheelabrator's stock would probably be sold to the public, and some might be distributed as a dividend to the current shareholders of Henley. A company spokesman said that Henley, a company whose philosophy is to create values by buying and selling businesses, would retain a sizable chunk of Wheelabrator Technology's shares. **********Mr. Dingman said that ''foreigners'' had expressed an interest in investing in Wheelabrator, a company that is in the forefront of the promising market for turning waste products into energy.

Allied-Signal and Henley had previously announced that they were conducting negotiations regarding the repurchase by Henley of the stock, and most analysts figured that the successful conclusion of the deal was a foregone conclusion. **********Sources familiar with the buyback, however, said the negotiations were complicated by the modification of the so-called support agreements, which committed Allied to helping some of the projects that Henley had under way. For instance, under the newly revised support agreement for the waste-to-energy projects, Allied-Signal will help Wheelabrator receive a single-A bond rating on a number of its current projects that are under development. **********The sale of the Henley stock gives Allied-Signal funds to retire debt and repurchase the last of the preferred shares it has outstanding. **********''These agreements will provide Allied-Signal with an additional $530 million in cash and is another step in sharpening its focus on high-technology businesses,'' said Edward L.

W. Botha said his Government was prepared to begin talks with the nuclear powers on the possibility of signing the 1970 Nonproliferation Treaty, which has been signed by 134 nations. **********''South Africa hopes that it will soon be able to sign the Nonproliferation Treaty and has decided to open discussions with others to this end,'' Mr. Botha said. The South African Government has until now consistently refused to sign the accord. Agency Officials Meet **********Mr. Botha's statement came as officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency were meeting in Vienna. **********Some Western diplomats said the move might be directed at staving off a Nigerian-led effort to suspend South Africa from the agency. But others said it was part of a larger plan of concessions to win Western support for a negotiated racial settlement in South Africa that would limit the influence of exiled nonwhite movements. **********South Africa's nuclear industry is shrouded in secrecy and the Government has refused to confirm or deny persistent rumors that it has collaborated with Israel in the development of nuclear weapons. Weapons Tests Charged **********South Africa has faced accusations in the United Nations and other international forums that it has tested nuclear weapons. The accumulated suspicion has been compounded by its refusal to open its uranium enrichment plant at Valindaba, west of Pretoria, for inspection. **********If South Africa joined the accord, analysts said, it would have to negotiate a ''safeguards'' agreement allowing agency inspectors to visit the country's nuclear plants to check that fuel was not being used for nuclear weapons. **********Western diplomats said such a move would mean a major scaling down of the country's nuclear energy program. Prepared to Negotiate **********Mr. Botha said in his statement that talks could depend on the results of the Vienna meeting, adding that his Government was prepared to negotiate on the inspection of its nuclear facilities. **********''Any safeguards agreements which might be negotiated with the I.A.E.A. will naturally be along the same lines as and conform with agreements with other nonproliferation signatories,'' Mr. Botha said. Although the charter of the International Atomic Energy Agency does not expressly provide for expulsion, members can be deprived of the ''rights and privileges of membership'' by a two-thirds vote of the General Conference. **********Agency officials say this would amount to expulsion since South Africa would no longer have access to agency meetings and seminars or to the information on nuclear safety and other technical topics that it collects, assesses and circulates to member countries. **********However, the I.A.E.A. would continue to inspect South African nuclear installations currently under safeguards since these inspections are made under separate agreements between Pretoria and the agency. Reactors Under Inspection **********South Africa already has two French nuclear power reactors operating at Koeberg near Cape Town, which France placed under I.A.E.A. inspection when it built them. South African scientists also operate a research reactor called Safari 1 that is under agency inspection. **********Under the Nonproliferation Treaty, Britain, China, the Soviet Union and the United States are allowed to retain their nuclear weapons but pledge to work for nuclear disarmament and a ban on nuclear testing. France, which also has nuclear weapons, refuses to sign but acts as if it were a signer allowed such weapons. **********South Africa effectively controls the output of uranium in South-West Africa, the South African-controlled territory also known as Namibia, although it is mined by a subsidiary of the British-based multinational Rio Tinto Zinc. **********The uranium mined at the Rossing Mine in South-West Africa is widely used in the West, and a suspension of Pretoria from the agency could have political implications that might lead to a disruption in the West's uranium supply, analysts said.  ISRAEL IS A TARGET, TOO **********UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Sept. 21 -The same coalition of countries that is trying to oust South Africa from the atomic agency is also trying to expel Israel, according to diplomats and agency officials. **********The campaign has been mounted by third world nations with some Soviet support. It is strongly opposed by the United States and other Western members, which argue that expelling South Africa and Israel would politicize a technical United Nations agency and weaken efforts to improve reactor safety and stop the spread of atomic weapons. **********In a telephone interview from Vienna, the United States Energy Secretary, John S. Herrington, warned that Congressional support for funds for the I.A.E.A. was likely to ''collapse'' if Israel and South Africa were expelled, perhaps forcing the United States to withdraw from the organization. **********He said the vote on South African and Israel membership, expected Thursday or Friday, was likely to be close. **********''How can we tell Congress that money for the I.A.E.A. is money well spent if that body acts in so political a way and expels two members for purely political reasons?'' Mr. Herrington asked. **********American officials said Mr. Herrington had told Soviet delegates today that Russian support for ousting the two countries breached the spirit of the emerging new superpower nuclear arms reduction treaty.

Many of them wore buttons saying, ''Kill the Moratorium,'' a reference to a moratorium on new bank powers. The moratorium is set to expire March 1. **********But at the dinners and receptions that most of the 6,500 participants have attended, conversations have focused heavily on more immediate economic issues: The next move for the stock market, which plunged last week, and prospects for the economy over all. Forecasts Are Gloomy **********In general, the forecasts being made here are gloomy. **********Most bankers, for example, seem to believe that interest rates have not peaked. A majority of those contacted said short-term rates will rise by anywhere from one to two percentage points by spring. The prime rate has already been raised to 9.75 percent by three banks and others may follow. The prime is the rate to which most loans to small- and medium-size companies are tied. **********''If I had to make a guess now,'' said Alan S. Fellheimer, chairman and chief executive of Equimark, Pittsburgh's third-largest bank, ''I could see a prime rate of 11.75 percent to 12 percent by the end of the first quarter.'' **********Because the markets have been in such turmoil, the predictions are more tenuous than usual, and what such a rate increase in such a short time would mean is, of course, equally uncertain. But bankers said that in general, companies would find it more difficult to obtain loans as lenders become skittish about customers' ability to pay interest. **********Beyond that, bankers said, a slowdown in economic growth would be inevitable. So far, no one seems willing to declare that a recession is around the corner. But bankers, noting that the two percentage-point rate increase since mid-April has already depressed commercial and housing construction, said additional rate increases that will take place in coming weeks will spread to other sectors of the economy. 'Looking at 2 Percent Growth' **********A two percentage point increase ''would call into question the sustainability of the recovery,'' said William E. Gibson, chairman of the asset-liability committee at the Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company. ''You'd be looking at 2 percent growth rather than 3 percent.'' **********''The possibility of a recession is higher today than it was six months ago precisely because of higher rates,'' said Anthony P. Terracciano, formerly of the Chase Manhattan Bank and now president and chief operating officer of the Mellon Bank Corporation. **********Bankers are also worried about the stock market. **********In recent years, the bull market in stocks has provided bankers with increasing fee income for their trust departments. Last week, however, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 235.48 points, or 9.49 percent. Friday's 108.36-point plunge in the Dow seemed to be on everyone's lips. Now, while few, if any, bankers here are predicting a catastrophic decline in the Dow, the prevailing opinion was that the index could fall hundreds of points before stabilizing. **********The problem, bankers said, is an even greater amount of uncertainty than usual. Whereas financial markets in the past focused almost entirely on inflation and interest rates, the stock market today seems gripped by a multitude of fears, bankers said. These include concerns that the United States trade deficit will not shrink, the Federal budget deficit will remain huge, and the value of the dollar, which affects inflation in this country, will fall further. Pressure on Equity Prices **********In the absence of clear resolutions to any of these uncertainties, many investors will choose to steer clear of the stock market, bankers said. And that could put further pressure on equity prices when the stock market reopens this morning. **********''All I hear inside the bank is about the unbelievable degree of anxiety in the marketplace,'' said Charles Pistor, chairman and chief executive of First Republicbank of Dallas and the incoming president of the bankers association. ''The uncertainties are producing anxiety beyond the fact base, beyond the fundamentals.'' **********Indeed, beneath the somber economic projections being made is a feeling of frustration - a belief that the higher interest rates and flagging stock market are simply not justified by real economic developments. **********Bankers noted, for example, that interest rates generally rise because of strong demand for credit or out of fears of inflation. For months, however, business demand for loans has been weak, and there have been no jolts to the economy, such as an oil shortage, that would produce inflation. **********If there is a real problem, it is that the trade deficit has not narrowed significantly. Financial markets, therefore, may be responding not to bad news but to a lack of good. **********''The problem is that the trade deficit is not getting any better, and the market is deeply concerned about it,'' said Mr. Gibson at Continental Illinois."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/04/world/argentine-crisis-ignites-press-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1987-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 979, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARGENTINE CRISIS IGNITES PRESS DISPUTE", "print_headline": "ARGENTINE CRISIS IGNITES PRESS DISPUTE", "body_text": " **********Argentina's recent military crisis set off a conflict between the Government of President Raul Alfonsin and the privately owned press over coverage and the way the Government used television to rally support. **********The rebellions by army units also highlighted the near monopoly on television news by the Government and its ownership of most provincial radio stations. The state's dominant role in broadcast journalism developed during four decades of authoritarian Governments, but leaders of privately owned television, radio and newspapers contend that such a position contradicts the new political democracy. **********La Nacion, the country's most prestigious newspaper and one that usually supports President Alfonsin, said Government influence over television and radio was ''present in these days like a retardatory factor in our democratic maturity.'' It suggested that the continued existence of the state-owned networks had tempted the Government into using them for propaganda purposes during the rebellions. **********The rebellions, which broke out on April 16 and continued for six days, began after judicial efforts to prosecute officers who are accused of human rights violations committed during counterinsurgency warfare a decade ago. After the rebellions, the army high command was restructured, and the Government decided to seek legal ways to restrict prosecution to high-ranking officers. TV Used to Urge Support **********During the tensest days of the crisis, the main television channels regularly urged people to go to the Plaza de Mayo in the capital or to plazas in provincial towns to demonstrate support for the Government. The phrase ''Democracy or Dictatorship'' flashed frequently across the bottoms of television screens. Correspondents and newscasters praised the turnout and urged more people into the plazas. By contrast, there was very little television news coverage of the actions and demands of the rebellious officers. **********Most of the coverage of the officers was by several privately owned radio stations in the capital and by newspapers and two news agencies, which were criticized by the Government and prominent members of the Radical Civic Union, the President's party. **********The Mayor of Buenos Aires, Facundo Suarez Lastra, charged last week that private radio stations had covered the crisis badly because they had ''given access to the air to seditious elements.'' He mentioned specifically an interview broadcast with Lieut. Col. Aldo Rico, leader of the rebels at Campo de Mayo, the military base near Buenos Aires, where President Alfonsin personally intervened to obtain the surrender of the rebels. **********News associations said several radio stations and one news agency had obtained interviews with Colonel Rico by telephone by calling the numbers listed in the telephone book for the infantry school at the Campo de Mayo. Government Objects to Reports **********While the crisis was under way, Government representatives issued several appeals to the press not to report on the news conferences or proclamations of the rebel officers. **********Julio Lopez, deputy director of press relations for the Government, said in an interview today that the Government had also objected at the time to some press reports that the rebellion was spreading to units that, in fact, were not in rebellion. He said ''the only problem was that some people did not check their sources.'' **********Mr. Lopez defended the use of television to garner support for the Government, saying it had been part of a ''spontaneous'' outpouring of effort to support democracy. **********He also said that some of the conflict over news coverage had been inevitable in the heat of the crisis and that it reflected the fact that Argentina is still making a transition to democracy. **********The country's largest circulation newspaper, Clarin, said the disagreement over the coverage came about because of conflicting views over the place of the press in a democracy. Obligations of the Press **********In an unusually long editorial signed by its editor, Ernestina Herrera de Noble, the newspaper said there were some who thought that ''the press ought to reflect all the facts'' and others who thought that the press should be ''adversaries in the democratic system.'' She said Clarin saw its place as a presenter of facts and not as an element in the exercise of power. **********La Nacion, as well as several smaller newspapers, said the experience of the past two weeks demonstrated the need to privatize the dozens of radio and television stations that were inherited by the Government from previous Administrations. **********The state has played a prominent role in radio and television since their introduction in Argentina, but at various periods there have been trends toward privatization - all of them eventually supplanted by new trends toward state control. At one point, in the first Administration of Juan Domingo Peron, who took power in 1946, most newspapers also were state controlled. **********All television stations were nationalized by the last Peronist Government in 1974. Since then, only one, Channel 9 in the capital, has been sold to private owners. Channel 9 is primarily an entertainment station. Privatizing Radio **********Toward the end of the last military regime, which gave up power after Mr. Alfonsin's election in 1983, privatization of radio stations was begun. Most of the stations in the capital have been sold or returned to private owners, and it was those stations that were most aggressive in covering the recent crisis, sending mobile units to key locations. **********A law pending in Congress would continue that privatization, but it is not thought to be near passage. **********The daily business newspaper Ambito Financiero reported that more than 60 radio stations, most of them in the provinces, and 17 television stations were still in Government hands."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/27/business/business-digest-monday-july-27-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 430, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, JULY 27, 1987", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, JULY 27, 1987", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********The trade problem has emerged as a major issue among contenders for the 1988 Presidential nominations.

''The monks show the way,'' was how one Tibetan here put it. **********But on the fringes of the protests and later working behind the scenes were some foreigners who believe in the cause of Tibetan independence. Many of them live in the white-block, three-story Banakshol Hotel, a haven for budget travelers and others who do not mind washing their clothes or brushing their teeth in the communal sinks in the hotel's courtyard. **********Three foreigners said in interviews that they had thrown stones at the Chinese police at the most violent demonstration on Oct. 1. **********During that protest, the Chinese police arrested monks who were leading pilgrims around the Jokhang Cathedral, Tibetan Buddhism's holiest shrine. Angered at the arrests, crowds of Tibetans formed in front of a police substation across an alleyway from the Jokhang and began throwing stones. Soon police vehicles were overturned and set afire, and the police station was set ablaze. **********Several foreigners asserted that they hung in the shadows of Jokhang doorways capturing on film the destruction of the police station and the reaction of the police, who fired small arms and automatic weapons into the crowd. At least nine Tibetans were killed by gunfire, and China now reports the death of six Chinese, most of whom are presumed to be policemen. **********The participation of the foreigners in the protests was well known in the monasteries around the city, monks said, and the monks there expressed admiration for their activities. **********''Tibetans protected the foreigners,'' one monk said. ''We helped them get away from the police.''  Shows of Strength **********As the demonstrations grew, the authorities in Beijing responded by sending 600 heavily armed policemen to Lhasa to maintain order. Last Sunday, three days after the burning of the police station, a Deputy Minister of Public Security flew to Lhasa. **********As the Deputy Minister arrived at Lhasa's airport, squads of policemen were there to welcome him, and the arrival was filmed for later broadcast on Lhasa television. **********Later in the week, he had his picture taken in front of the Jokhang Cathedral. Evidence that perhaps Lhasa had not returned to normal, as the Chinese said it had, was suggested when he appeared surrounded by dozens of policemen with assault rifles and machine pistols. **********Intimidation of the Tibetan populace increased on Wednesday, Oct. 7, the 37th anniversary of China's invasion of Tibet. A bit after midday, a convoy of open-bed trucks led by a station wagon, its rooftop red light spinning and its siren screaming, crawled down the main street of the city. On each of 13 trucks, 25 to 30 policemen stood rigidly at attention clutching AK-47 rifles. **********Tibetans lined the street, silently watching the procession of strength. There were no demonstrations that day.  Long Isolated, Then Open **********When the news of an anti-Chinese demonstration in Lhasa and the arrest of 21 monks reached Beijing on Sept. 29, foreign reporters were surprised that it was reported in some detail by the official Chinese press agency, which mostly devotes itself to glowing accounts of China's modernization efforts. **********Two days later, two reporters from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse rushed to Chengdu, the first leg of the trip to Lhasa. There, they interviewed tourists returning from Lhasa and learned that a far more bloody demonstration had taken place on Oct. 1. Tourists provided vivid descriptions of battles between stone-throwing Tibetans and gun-firing policemen. There were reports of young monks being shot and two elderly monks escaping from the burning police station. **********With that report, nearly 20 foreign reporters based in Beijing all headed toward Lhasa, where more detailed descriptions of events were provided by tourists and by monks. **********From the 17th to the 19th centuries, Tibet was so isolated that only the fervent religiousity of Jesuit missionaries or the determined ambition of explorers drove Westerners toward this mysterious land. Surrounded by soaring snow-capped mountains, Lhasa became in the popular imagination a ''lost kingdom.'' **********The Chinese invasion of 1950 and the Chinese armed suppression of an independence movement in 1959 further sealed Tibet off from the world. **********Now, with daily flights in and out of Lhasa, Tibet has become a relatively easy destination. And though the Chinese authorities have now prevented foreign reporters from covering events in Tibet, there was a brief opening during which the story was brought to newspapers across the world. **********At first the authorities, whether through confusion or indecision, permitted journalists to file substantial reports on police brutality, the mood in monasteries and the overall situation in Lhasa. At the Lhasa Hotel, where foreign reporters were housed, Chinese officials ordered the two telexes shut down but permitted some telephone calls overseas. Meanwhile, officials at Lhasa's telecommunications office installed a second telex to handle the surge in business. **********Then on Tuesday, another protest took place at which 90 monks were arrested, many after being beaten by policemen wielding rifle butts, clubs and belts. Reports of this protest were transmitted by telex and telephone to the outside world. Then the Chinese authorities severed all links. **********Early Thursday morning, a senior Chinese official summoned all the reporters at the Lhasa Hotel to a meeting and told them they were expelled from Tibet for having failed to apply for permission to enter the province.  Fear of Chinese **********At the ancient monasteries just outside Lhasa, monks moved quietly through the dark corridors that lead between cavernous prayer halls and tiny sleeping chambers suffused with the fragrance of yak-butter lamps. **********Fear of the Chinese was palpable, with monks shepherding visitors into darkened corners. Here and there, the outlawed Tibetan flag peeked from behind a Buddha figure or adorned the wall of a chamber. **********Everywhere the talk was of the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader of Tibetan Buddhism, who was denounced by the Chinese for supposedly instigating the protests in Lhasa. **********At one monastery, a 63-year-old monk told two visitors: ''The Dalai Lama is the only one religious and political leader for us. The Chinese Government says the Tibetan people don't want independence. But everyone wants independence. Everyone loves the Dalai Lama.'' **********Sitting next to him on the sleeping pallet, another old monk, tears streaming, said: ''There are thorns all around us. If the Dalai Lama were here, it would all be flowers.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/28/business/company-news-suit-challenges-crazy-eddie.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 235, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Suit Challenges Crazy Eddie", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Suit Challenges Crazy Eddie", "body_text": " **********Entertainment Marketing Inc., which has threatened a proxy fight for control of Crazy Eddie Inc., filed a lawsuit in Delaware State Court today asking that Crazy Eddie be forced to hold its annual meeting.

A scolding saleswoman shoveled them into the bags of customers who had formed a 15-minute line. **********The strawberry scene spoke eloquently of the bizarre anomalies of the Soviet pricing system and its byproducts: unreasonably high or low prices and long lines for products whose quality is uneven at best. Complex of Controls and Subsidies **********The rigid pricing system is a complex fabric of Government controls and subsidies with isolated patches of quasi-free market economies, including farm markets that sell produce from private plots. **********It is this system that Mikhail S. Gorbachev is proposing to alter with his program, newly endorsed by the Communist Party, to gradually introduce price flexibility in the Soviet economy. **********Inherent in the issue of prices, according to Western and Soviet analysts, are the key difficulties that face most of Mr. Gorbachev's initiatives in his broad drive to remake Soviet society: *********** Reining in a powerful bureaucracy, in this case the State Committee for Prices, known by the acronym Goskomtsen. It sets more than 200,000 wholesale and retail prices annually, on everything from raw materials like ore and grain to bread, shoes, chinaware and cars. *********** Potentially tampering with a basic tenet of Communist ideology and the Soviet social contract, in this case overall price stability and drmatically low prices on basic foods, housing, education and mass transit. *********** Taking a cumbersome, inefficient but predictable system and introducing an element of the unknown, in this case, a limited role for competitive forces and the possibility of politically explosive inflation. Food price increases in Eastern Europe have sometimes touched off protest and political instability. 'Jumping Out Into the Unknown' **********A Western diplomat predicted last week that conservatives would call the pricing innovations a threat to the basic order of Communism. The current system, he said, is a known quantity, but Mr. Gorbachev's proposals are ''jumping out into the unknown.'' **********The new pricing policies, like most of the sweeping changes, have not been worked out in enough detail to be made law during a session next week of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Parliament. **********The one economic law the Supreme Soviet is expected to enact will allow the state's enterprises greater freedom to manage their own affairs, chose their managers and offer bonuses to their workers. **********How fast and how far Mr. Gorbachev will jump on the price issue is still under discussion, according to Abel G. Aganbegyan, the economist who was selected to explain Mr. Gorbachev's new proposals at a news conference. **********Mr. Aganbegyan explained that the alternatives under discussion were either a stage-by-stage shift in the present pricing mechanisms, with the first stage affecting only wholesale prices, or an overall re-examination of wholesale, retail and agricultural prices, with no changes before 1990. Instrument of Efficiency **********The guidelines for Mr. Gorbachev's economic changes, approved Friday by the Communist Party's Central Committee, said prices should be made ''an effective instrument for raising the efficiency of social production, for developing economic management methods and for deepening cost-accounting and self-financing.'' **********The role of the price-fixing committee would be reduced in part by increased freedom of factories and large enterprises to contract directly with each other for industrial goods. **********The Central Committee program said that wholesale prices should be amended to reflect production costs more accurately and that raw materials and fuel - such as heating oil -should be priced to reflect production cost and to discourage waste. Little Incentive on Costs **********Until now, according to American specialists, wholesale prices were supposed to be roughly equivalent to production cost. But there was little incentive to keep costs down because of widely available subsidies. **********In contrast, retail prices were supposed to be set at a level that would guarantee a balance between supply and demand. This was a goal that was largely unmet, judging by the periodic shortages of everything from fruit to furniture. **********Prices were also used to insure that some products were accessible to low-paid workers. Meat in state stores in Moscow and other cities sells at less than half the cost of production. Like other foods, particularly bread, it is heavily subsidized. But buyers often have to wait in line for meat that is of low quality, if available at all. In farmers' markets, it is likely available but higher priced. $115 Billion in Subsidies According to Mr. Gorbachev's speech Thursday, the Soviet economy spends 72 billion rubles a year (more than $115 billion) in subsidies. More than 50 billion rubles of this goes to agriculture. **********The farm subsidy has increased 150 percent in the last 10 years, and is now more than 12 times the 1966 level of four billion rubles, according to articles in the Soviet press. **********''What is happening?'' asked a professor of economics, R. Khasbulatov, writing in Komsomolskaya Pravda. ''Agricultural productivity is virtually at a standstill'' and the inefficiency is forcing up subsidies. **********He said such subsidies were paid for in part by inflated prices on goods like imported jeans (marked up sevenfold) and similar products. **********The average wage is slightly under 200 rubles a month, or $310. Even with subsidies, about 30 percent of the total is spent on food, according to a 1985 survey - compared with 19 percent by American families, economists said. Risks of Social Unrest **********To increase the prices of bread and meat, for example, which have changed little in decades, without increasing salaries is to ask for social unrest. In Poland in 1976, an increase in food prices was canceled after widespread protests, strikes and, in one city, riots. **********But to increase salaries means increased prices for the goods the workers produce - and the essential elements for inflation are then present. **********What about inflation? The word did not appear in the discussion of prices in the Central Committee blueprint. The most it would caution was: ''It is necessary . . . to overcome the tendency toward the growth of prices on the basis of the development of the competitive power of enterprises.'' **********This was a prescription for letting competition achieve price cuts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/05/world/quotations-of-the-day-986187.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 48, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Quotations of the Day", "print_headline": "Quotations of the Day", "body_text": " **********''I was prepared for it.'' - Mathias Rust, sentenced to four years in labor camp. **********''We hope that he won't have to serve the whole term.'' - His mother, Monika.

Nowadays, hotels, computer companies and manufacturers are also profiting from incarceration. They are hiring inmates, usually below minimum wage and with no extra pay for weekends or holidays, to provide goods and services at a fraction of normal costs. **********RUNNING prisons is not the only way to make money from the prison system. Nowadays, hotels, computer companies and manufacturers are also profiting from incarceration. They are hiring inmates, usually below minimum wage and with no extra pay for weekends or holidays, to provide goods and services at a fraction of normal costs. Moreover, since the work is typically done inside the correction facility, overhead costs are virtually nil. **********The idea of prison labor is not new, of course. Most state governments in the 19th century contracted out convicts to mines, sweatshops and farms. Later, prisoners were used in state-run industries to make license plates, road signs and other public goods. In fact, half the states still will not let prisoners make goods for sale to the general public. **********But in the other half, prisoners are busily making lamps, shoes and other items for retail consumption. Some are even staffing phones and computers. **********For example, Best Western International in Phoenix, which operates 1,900 hotels in North America, installed computer terminals in the Arizona Center for Women, a pre-release center, in 1981. It pays 30 inmates $4.50 an hour to serve as telephone reservation operators. ''Especially during the peak season in the summer, we need to call people into work at a moment's notice, '' said company spokeswoman Lois Kein. ''Temporary workers can't just drop what they're doing and come in.'' **********Best Western apparently is pleased with the way the prisoners handle the job. It has employed 16 former inmates to work full-time. **********States that buy the output of prison industries often find their own supply costs drastically slashed. Three years ago Florida shifted control of all prison industries to Prison Rehabilitative Industries and Diversified Enterprises (PRIDE). The nonprofit organization uses inmates to produce more than 46 types of goods, including shoes, metal furniture and car tags. The wares are sold to public agencies. **********Last year PRIDE sold 1.2 million pairs of shoes and work boots at prices ranging from $13.25 to $18.75, several dollars cheaper than American competition. It could charge that price because it paid inmates between 55 cents and $1.10 an hour. **********However, James McDonie , director of national sales for PRIDE, quickly points out that wage rates for regular workers in some countries are even lower. **********''It's wrong to believe that inmate labor is a whole lot cheaper,'' he said. ''We're competing against Hong Kong and South Korea.'' **********Indeed, even behind bars, prisoners are part of an international economy. The Control Data Corporation in Minnesota used inmates at the Stillwater prison to assemble computer components, but that program ended seven months ago when the manufacturing of those products was shifted to Portugal. **********Other prisoners have discovered the perils of corporate mergers. In 1984, Howard Johnson's Inc. established a telephone reservation operation at the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center in Oklahoma City. The program ended the next year, when the company was bought by the Marriott Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/10/world/iran-contra-hearings-a-fall-guy-yes-a-patsy-no-a-president-s-servant-says.html": {"writer_name": "Maureen Dowd", "pub_date": "1987-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1431, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A FALL GUY YES, A PATSY NO, A PRESIDENT'S SERVANT SAYS", "print_headline": "IRAN-CONTRA HEARINGS; A FALL GUY YES, A PATSY NO, A PRESIDENT'S SERVANT SAYS", "body_text": " **********He was willing to take the hit. He was ready to be dropped like a hot rock. He would play the ''fall guy,'' as he put it in tough-guy lingo, allowing his superiors to finger him on a scheme that was going down the tubes. **********But Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North would not play the patsy. **********''When I heard the words criminal investigation,'' he told the Iran committee today, ''my mindset changed considerably.'' **********''There was probably not another person on the planet Earth as surprised as I was to hear that someone thought it was criminal,'' he said. ''And that I was the only person on the planet Earth named on that appointment order.'' **********Colonel North, who has turned the Iran committee hearings into electrifying theater, did not disappoint today. Cast no longer as a flip and combative cowboy blithely bending the law, the colonel now presented himself as the earnest servant of the President -with an affecting crack in his voice -seeking to convince a thickheaded Congress that he was being railroaded. Subtle Combat **********He had a worthy opponent in Arthur L. Liman, who clearly felt he needed to wrest back some of the sympathy Colonel North has won this week. The colonel jutted his chin out and the counselor tucked his in. But their combat was subtle and soft-voiced, for the most part, as if Mr. Liman had decided he could not win with the aggressive, condescending manner that often characterized his questioning on previous occasions. **********John W. Nields Jr., the gentlemanly House counsel, had been expected on Tuesday and Wednesday to play the good cop, but he was often aggressive - possibly because he was genuinely angry at times. Now Mr. Liman, whom the heralds had cast as the hard guy, played Mr. Nields's expected role - a neat and surprising reversal. His questions were pointed but his manner mild. Liman Changes Tactics **********Mr. Liman, who had been a caustic and stabbing interrogator with other witnesses, like Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, changed tactics with the popular Marine officer. The public, he apparently realized from the flood of calls and letters coming into the committee office, felt the colonel was being unfairly picked on. In May, indeed, Mr. Liman also received a flood of letters complaining that he had badgered and mistreated General Secord, a retired Air Force major general who was the first witness before the committees. **********Today, Colonel North's lawyer, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., tried once more to portray his client as the beleaguered victim of Congressional bullying. ''Why don't you get off his back?'' Mr. Sullivan snapped at his interrogators. **********So Mr. Liman cleverly acted the high school principal with the errant schoolboy - trying to make Colonel North see his errors despite the colonel's continuing protests that he had done nothing illegal or wrong in the diversion of funds to the Nicaragan rebels. 'Go Stand in the Corner' **********''And have you wondered why, if it was a good idea,'' Mr. Liman said, silkily, ''that the President of the United States dismissed you because of it?'' **********The colonel replied: ''If the Commander in Chief tells this lieutenant colonel to go stand in the corner and sit on his head, I will do so.'' **********Mr. Liman also asked - in that sympathetic voice with the edge of the disciplinarian - why the witness did not confront Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter upon learning that his boss had not received the approval of the President on memos as he had thought. Giving a Civics Lesson **********''I'm not in the habit of questioning my superiors,'' Colonel North replied at one point. ''If he deemed it not to be necessary to ask the President, I saluted smartly and charged up the hill.'' **********The lawyer spoke to the younger man as though he were giving him a civics lesson. **********''And you would agree with the proposition, wouldn't you, that in our desire to promote democracy abroad, including Nicaragua and elsewhere, we must never sacrifice our democratic values here?'' he asked, as the Colonel nodded. **********But while Mr. Liman may have achieved the impression that Colonel North's superiors were painting him as a ''loose cannon'' to save themselves, Colonel North remained protective of his former bosses. **********''That is the part of any subordinate,'' he said. ''Every centurion had a group of shields out in front of him - a hundred of them.'' **********He said he did not think that the former national security advisers Robert C. McFarlane and Admiral Poindexter ''would have ever placed me in jeopardy of a criminal prosecution.'' Painting North as Delinquent **********He said he was willing to ''take the rap'' in the political arena, but not in the criminal courts. **********Mr. Liman asked the colonel if he had not winced when he was read the section of the Tower Commission report that quoted the President as saying he knew nothing about the National Security Council staff's efforts on behalf of the contras. **********''I don't know what you read in my wince,'' Colonel North snapped. ''It may have been that my back hurt.'' **********Mr. Liman was at his sharpest, acting appalled and moving in to paint Colonel North as very delinquent, when the witness jauntily confessed that he had shredded documents from his files even while the Justice Department officials were in his office collecting files for evidence. Fairness Was 'Out the Window' **********''That's a pretty high-speed shredder,'' the colonel said, smiling. ''It eats 'em pretty quick.'' **********Colonel North's lawyer, Mr. Sullivan, testily objected to the committee on the slightest hint that the colonel was being bullied - telling Mr. Lyman he was ''in dreamland'' and that, with Congress, fairness was ''out the window.'' **********In his opening statement, Colonel North continued to present himself as a selfless patriot, the servant of ''a great President'' - better able than Congress to judge the needs of the United States - ''a nation at risk'' in a ''dangerous world.'' 'Son of Checkers' **********Colonel North's opening statement was dubbed ''Son of Checkers'' by skeptics in the chamber - because of its similarity in tone to Richard M. Nixon's famous speech of 35 years ago, in which the issue of whether he should have accepted money from wealthy contributors got lost in a melodramatic miasma about his wife's cloth coat and his cocker spaniel. The Colonel's Best Friend **********With his wife sitting behind him, making her first appearance at the hearings, the Colonel said, ''My best friend is my wife, Betsy, to whom I have been married for 19 years, and with whom I have had four wonderful children, aged 18, 16, 11 and 6.'' **********Colonel North has been drawing better ratings on television than the daytime soap operas, and he is drawing ever bigger crowds in person. Many Drive Long Distances **********Although the reaction to him on his first day was mixed, today it was leaning positive. Many had driven long distances just to see Colonel North, and commented sympathetically that he looked emotionally drained and must be worried about the terrorist threats on his life and the legal threats to his liberty. **********''He has revealed names from higher up,'' said 20-year-old Kathleen Moore from Miami. ''He's definitely not going to take the rap alone.'' **********Michael Wilson, a 12-year-old from Pasadena, Calif., agreed, saying, ''I think Reagan should be in there testifying.'' A Patriot Not a Profiteer **********Some of the committee members remained immune to the witness's legendary charm. **********''He thought he was a separate Secretary of State,'' sniffed Jack Brook, a Texas Democrat. **********But others melted under Colonel North's insistence that he was patriot, not profiteer. **********''He handled himself very well -he's articulate and intelligent and presents himself in a very smooth way in being able to turn questions that should go one way into a more positive vein,'' said Louis Stokes, Democrat of Ohio. **********Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, called the Colonel ''one of those people like Douglas McArthur or F.D.R.,'' adding: You either love him or hate him. It's hard to be indifferent.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/17/world/gorbachev-says-1987-could-see-arms-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 295, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gorbachev Says 1987 Could See Arms Pact", "print_headline": "Gorbachev Says 1987 Could See Arms Pact", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S.

''Send our people plowshares instead of swords, pruning hooks instead of spears.'' **********The President was honored with this year's medal and $340,000 award after he successfully persuaded the leaders of Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to join with him in signing the regional accord. **********The pact, to be carried out in full by January, aims at cease-fires in the civil wars of Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, amnesty for guerrilla fighters and the furtherance of such democratic ideas as a free press and the release of political prisoners. **********The key to it, he told the Nobel audience, is not peace to be followed ''someday'' by political progress. Rather, he said it promised ''peace and democracy, together, indivisible, an end to the shedding of human blood, which is inseparable from an end to the suppression of human rights.'' To Use Money for Needy **********For all the speculation and publicity that greets the Peace Prize each year, the award ceremony itself is unpretentious. Mr. Arias, who intends to use the money to start a foundation for the needy, reflected the day's simplicity in a speech of roughly 800 words, one of the shortest on record. **********The Nobel committee made no secret of the fact that it made the award in part to endorse the region's attempt to supersede East-West rivalry in the area by engineering its own peace plan. **********''The plan is a signpost in the work for peace the whole world over,'' Egil Aarvik, chairman of the Nobel committee, declared in presenting the award.

''During China's reforms, the economic system has been changed a lot. The Government wants to know if the mass of people will go along with it. If the policy proceeds too rapidly, or the methods aren't right and the people are opposed to it, it will fail.'' **********In a country more comfortable with unanimity than pluralism, his efforts represent a profound shift in the Government's long-held assumption that it invariably makes the correct decisions. Whether or how Mr. Wu's findings, which have revealed hidden reserves of unhappiness in the country, will ultimately influence policy making remains unclear. Indirect Questions Asked **********China's budding George H. Gallup, Mr. Wu is a 34-year-old statistician who favors tweed sport jackets and modish shirts with rounded collars. He acknowledges that the direct approach of pollsters in Europe and the United States does not work here. ''You can't just ask people whether they support the Communist Party,'' Mr. Wu said. ''You have to use indirect questions, like taking a detour.'' **********Whether genuine candor is possible in China is the root problem for any survey, Mr. Wu said. In almost four decades since the People's Republic was founded, ideological and intellectual conformity, forged during periods of tremendous political turmoil, has been idealized. During the chaos and violence of the decade-long cultural revolution which ended in 1976, any disagreement with the hysterical adulation of Mao resulted in criticism, or on occasion death. **********Though the madness of that decade has dissipated, the lives of China's citizens remain stringently controlled. Every neighborhood has a watch committee that keeps tabs on the behavior of residents and work places are supervised by Communist Party members who maintain records on workers' performance and attitudes, including political views. In this atmosphere, many Chinese admit they rarely express their true views, except among closest friends. **********While Mr. Wu said he struggled to surmount these hurdles of inhibition by monitoring of his interviewers and assuring anonymity to those polled, he had scorn for most other polls taken around the country. **********Mr. Wu cited one recent survey that purportedly measured how Beijing's residents regard the political system, found greatest satisfaction with the degree of freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the largely stage-managed election system. Students Have Too Much Money **********''This is much different from what I know,'' Mr. Wu said. **********Most of the polls in newspapers appear designed to support conventional political and social opinions. The Beijing Daily found that ''randomly chosen'' high school students ''tend to have too much pocket money.'' This averaged out to 11.04 yuan, or $2.98 each month. ''The survey indicates,'' the newspaper said, ''that many male students spend money drinking, smoking and eating out in expensive restaurants and it is common for female students to give gifts to their schoolmates.'' **********Other polls gauge public sentiment about daily life. The economic daily surveyed 1,230 people in the northeast city of Shenyang about inflation and found that 79 percent felt that prices were rising too fast, while nearly three-quarters said that society was becoming ''too money oriented.'' **********The Communist Youth League at Beijing and Qinghua Universities got into the act with a poll of the political attitudes of college students and found that 93 percent of the students polled believed it was ''necessary'' to carry out changes in China's political system. **********Mr. Wu said his objectives were more complex and far reaching than the single-issue surveys conducted by newspapers and political organizations. **********''This is a survey of China's national characteristics,'' Mr. Wu said. ''We are the first to do this face-to-face investigation for the whole society. What we are trying to do is assess the quality of spiritual civilization, something that mainly involves things like ethics, ideology, subjective matters.'' **********Mr. Wu and his colleagues are still analyzing their biggest survey to date, which polled 4,244 people in 42 cities. So far they have found that only 18.6 percent of those polled characterized the Chinese as ''intelligent'' and only 2.7 percent found them ''adventurous.'' Half of the respondents chose ''industrious'' and ''frugal'' to describe China's national character. **********''We think we're getting honest responses,'' Mr. Wu said. ''Apart from asking questions indirectly, we are very careful about selecting interviewers. We want people who are high school graduates but not college graduates. They tend to inject their own opinions into the poll-taking. We also don't want surveyors who would prompt people to call the police.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/02/world/rumania-resists-emulating-soviet-changes.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1987-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 676, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rumania Resists Emulating Soviet Changes", "print_headline": "Rumania Resists Emulating Soviet Changes", "body_text": " **********Little need is felt for far-reaching governmental and economic change in this orthodox Communist country, nor is there much of the striving for the openness that accompanies that process in the Soviet Union. **********Though the economy's shortcomings touch off occasional violence, such as the rioting by thousands of auto workers in central Rumania in November, there is no indication that opposition to the regime is organized or that the position of the Rumanian leader, Nicolae Ceausescu, is endangered. Nor is there evidence that the process includes the practice of de-emphasizing personal tributes to the country's leader, as Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, has done informally in the Soviet Union.

''The point is improved application of present mechanisms, which contain the main principles. These principles are not yet being applied to the last consequence.'' **********When asked about the critical shortages of food and energy that led to the November unrest, Mr. Olteanu said, ''Every economist knows that some decisions have advantages and disadvantages, even costs. It is obvious in this period on the social level that there are inconveniences.'' **********Mr. Ceausescu has made repayment of Rumania's foreign debt, a result of a costly and unprofitable investment program in his early years of power, a prime objective. Since 1981, he has approximately halved debt estimated then at about $11 billion. **********The net result has been a sharp reduction in consumer goods, including basic foodstuffs, as priority is given to reducing imports and spurring exports. Concerns on Human Rights **********The United States Congress has threatened to revoke Rumania's most-favored-nation trading status because of a poor human rights record on emigration, treatment of ethnic minorities and tolerance of religious activity. **********Diplomats could point to a few examples of liberalization. The number of emigrants thus far this year was 2,500, compared with 2,000 all last year. The Government allowed, for the first time since 1921, the printing of 5,000 Bibles in a version acceptable to Protestant churches. **********Meanwhile, evidently to divert attention from domestic concerns, Mr. Ceausescu has thrown himself into efforts to organize a meeting of Balkan heads of state, which he would like to convene in Bucharest some time next year. The idea would be to pursue closer regional economic integration, and in the field of politics to seek a regional ban on chemical and nuclear weapons. **********Six Balkan states - Yugoslavia, Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece and Turkey - have agreed to a meeting of foreign ministers in Belgrade in February. But the aims of a Balkan summit meeting are decribed as either vague or, as in the proposal for a nuclear-free zone, difficult to attain, and regional rivalries could scuttle the project at the Belgrade meeting."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/11/world/vatican-birth-science-text-vatican-s-doctrinal-statement-human-reproduction-part-371287.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 4579, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PART II: INTERVENTIONS UPON HUMAN PROCREATION", "print_headline": "THE VATICAN ON BIRTH SCIENCE  TEXT OF VATICAN'S DOCTRINAL STATEMENT ON HUMAN REPRODUCTION; PART II: INTERVENTIONS UPON HUMAN PROCREATION", "body_text": " **********Following is the text a Vatican doctrinal statement, ''Instruction on Respect for Human Life in Its Origin and on the Dignity of Procreation: Replies to Certain Questions of the Day,'' issued yesterday: **********By ''artificial procreation'' or ''artificial fertilization'' are understood here the different technical procedures directed towards obtaining a human conception in a manner other than the sexual union of man and woman. This Instruction deals with fertilization of an ovum in a test-tube (in vitro fertilization) and artificial insemination through transfer into the woman's genital tracts of previously collected sperm. **********A preliminary point for the moral evaluation of such technical procedures is constituted by the consideration of the circumstances and consequences which those procedures involve in relation to the respect due the human embryo. Development of the practice of in vitro fertilization has required innumerable fertilizations and destructions of human embryos. Even today, the usual practice presupposes a hyper-ovulation on the part of the woman: a number of ova are withdrawn, fertilized and then cultivated in vitro for some days. Usually not all are transferred into the genital tracts of the woman; some embryos, generally called ''spare,'' are destroyed or frozen. On occasion, some of the implanted embryos are sacrificed for various eugenic, economic or psychological reasons. Such deliberate destruction of human beings or their utilization for different purposes to the detriment of their integrity and life is contrary to the doctrine on procured abortion already recalled. **********The connection between in vitro fertilization and the voluntary destruction of human embryos occurs too often. This is significant: through these procedures, with apparently contrary purposes, life and death are subjected to the decision of man, who thus sets himself up as the giver of life and death by decree. This dynamic of violence and domination may remain unnoticed by those very individuals who, in wishing to utilize this procedure, become subject to it themselves. The facts recorded and the cold logic which links them must be taken into consideration for a moral judgment on IVF and ET (in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer): the abortion-mentality which has made this procedure possible thus leads, whether one wants it or not, to man's domination over the life and death of his fellow human beings and can lead to a system of radical eugenics. **********Nevertheless, such abuses do not exempt one from a further and thorough ethical study of the techniques of artificial procreation considered in themselves, abstracting as far as possible from the destruction of embryos produced in vitro. **********The present Instruction will therefore take into consideration in the first place the problems posed by heterologous artificial fertilization (II, 1-3), * and subsequently those linked with homologous artificial fertilization (II, 4-6). ** **********Before formulating an ethical judgment on each of these procedures, the principles and values which determine the moral evaluation of each of them will be considered.  A. HETEROLOGOUS ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZATION  1. Why must human procreation take place in marriage? **********Every human being is always to be accepted as a gift and blessing of God. However, from the moral point of view a truly responsible procreation vis-a-vis the unborn child must be the fruit of marriage. **********For human procreation has specific characteristics by virtue of the personal dignity of the parents and of the children: the procreation of a new person, whereby the man and the woman collaborate with the power of the Creator, must be the fruit and the sign of the mutual self-giving of the spouses, of their love and of their fidelity.  [ 34 ]  The fidelity of the spouses in the unity of marriage involves reciprocal respect of their right to become a father and a mother only through each other. **********The child has the right to be conceived, carried in the womb, brought into the world and brought up within marriage: it is through the secure and recognized relationship to his own parents that the child can discover his own identity and achieve his own proper human development. **********The parents find in their child a confirmation and completion of their reciprocal self-giving: the child is the living image of their love, the permanent sign of their conjugal union, the living and indissoluble concrete expression of their paternity and maternity.  [ 35 ] **********By reason of the vocation and social responsibilities of the person, the good of the children and of the parents contributes to the good of civil society; the vitality and stability of society require that children come into the world within a family and that the family be firmly based on marriage. **********The tradition of the Church and anthropological reflection recognize in marriage and in its indissoluble unity the only setting worthy of truly responsible procreation.  2. Does heterologous artifical fertilization conform to the dignity of the couple and to the truth of marriage? **********Through IVF and ET and heterologous artificial insemination, human conception is achieved through the fusion of gametes of at least one donor other than the spouses who are united in marriage. Heterologous artificial fertilization is contrary to the unity of marriage, to the dignity of the spouses, to the vocation proper to parents, and to the child's right to be conceived and brought into the world in marriage and from marriage.  [ 36 ] **********Respect for the unity of marriage and for conjugal fidelity demands that the child be conceived in mariage; the bond existing between husband and wife accords the spouses, in an objective and inalienable manner, the exclusive right to become father and mother solely through each other.  [ 37 ]  Recourse to the gametes of a third person, in order to have sperm or ovum available, constitutes a violation of the reciprocal commitment of the spouses and a grave lack in regard to that essential property of marriage which is its unity. **********Heterologous artificial fertilization violates the rights of the child; it deprives him of his filial relationship with his parental origins and can hinder the maturing of his personal identity. Furthermore, it offends the common vocation of the spouses who are called to fatherhood and motherhood: it objectively deprives conjugal fruitfulness of its unity and integrity; it brings about and manifests a rupture between genetic parenthood, gestational parenthood and responsibility for upbringing. Such damage to the personal relationships within the family has repercussions on civil society: what threatens the unity and stability of the family is a source of dissension, disorder and injustice in the whole of social life. **********These reasons lead to a negative moral judgment concerning heterologous artifical fertilization: consequently fertilization of a married woman with the sperm of a donor different from her husband and fertilization with the husband's sperm of an ovum not coming from his wife are morally illicit. Furthermore, the artificial fertilization of a woman who is unmarried or a widow, whoever the donor may be, cannot be morally justified. **********The desire to have a child and the love between spouses who long to obviate a sterility which cannot be overcome in any other way constitute understandable motivations; but subjectively good intentions do not render heterologous artificial fertilization conformable to the objective and inalienable properties of marriage or respectful of the rights of the child and of the spouses.  3. Is ''surrogate'' *  motherhood morally licit? **********No, for the same reasons which lead one to regect heterologous artificial fertilization: for it is contrary to the unity of marriage and to the dignity of the procreation of the human person. **********Surrogate motherhood represents an objective failure to meet the obligations of maternal love, of conjugal fidelity and of responsible motherhood; it offends the dignity and the right of the child to be conceived, carried in the womb, brought into the world and brought up by his own parents; it sets up, to the detriment of families, a division between the physical, psychological and moral elements which constitute those families.  B. HOMOLOGOUS ARTIFICIAL FERTILIZATION **********Since heterologous artificial fertilization has been declared unacceptable, the question arises of how to evaluate morally the process of homologous artificial fertilization: IVF and ET and artificial insemination between husband and wife. First a question of principle must be clarified.  4. What connection is required from the moral point of view between procreation and the conjugal act? **********a) The Church's teaching on marriage and human procreation affirms the ''inseparable connection, willed by God and unable to be broken by man on his own initiative, between the two meanings of the conjugal act: the unitive meaning and the procreative meaning. Indeed, by its intimate structure, the conjugal act, while most closely uniting husband and wife, capacitates them for the generation of new lives, according to laws inscribed in the very being of man and of woman.''  [ 38 ]  This principle, which is based upon the nature of marriage and the intimate connection of the goods of marriage, has well-known consequences on the level of responsible fatherhood and motherhood. ''By safeguarding both these essential aspects, the unitive and the procreative, the conjugal act preserves in its fullness the sense of true mutual love and its ordination towards man's exalted vocation to parenthood.''  [ 39 ] **********The same doctrine concerning the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and between the goods of marriage throws light on the moral problem of homologous artificial fertilization, since ''it is never permitted to separate these different aspects to such a degree as positively to exclude either the procreative intention or the conjugal relation.''  [ 40 ] **********Contraception deliberately deprives the conjugal act of its openness to procreation and in this way brings about a voluntary dissociation of the ends of marriage. Homologous artificial fertilization, in seeking a procreation which is not the fruit of a specific act of conjugal union, objectively effects an analogous separation between the goods and the meanings of marriage. **********Thus, fertilization is licitly sought when it is the result of a ''conjugal act which is per se suitable for the generation of children to which marriage is ordered by its nature and by which the spouses become one flesh.''  [ 41 ]  But from the moral point of view procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not desired as the fruit of the conjugal act, that is to say of the specific act of the spouses' union. **********b) The moral value of the intimate link between the goods of marriage and between the meanings of the conjugal act is based upon the unity of the human being, a unity involving body and spiritual soul.  [ 42 ]  Spouses mutually express their personal love in the ''language of the body,'' which clearly involves both ''sponsal meanings'' and parental ones.  [ 43 ]  The conjugal act by which the couple mutually express their self-gift at the same time expresses openness to the gift of life. It is an act that is inseparably corporal and spiritual. It is in their bodies and through their bodies that the spouses consummate their marriage and are able to become father and mother. In order to respect the language of their bodies and their natural generosity, the conjugal union must take place with respect for its openness to procreation; and the procreation of a person must be the fruit and the result of married love. The origin of the human being thus follows from a procreation that is ''linked to the union, not only biological but also spiritual, of the parents, made one by the bond of marriage.''  [ 44 ]  Fertilization achieved outside the bodies of the couple remains by this very fact deprived of the meanings and the values which are expressed in the language of the body and in the union of human persons. **********c) Only respect for the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make possible procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person. In his unique and irrepeatable origin, the child must be respected and recognized as equal in personal dignity to those who give him life. The human person must be accepted in his parents' act of union and love; the generation of a child must therefore be the fruit of that mutual giving  [ 45 ]  which is realized in the conjugal act wherein the spouses cooperate as servants and not as masters in the work of the Creator who is Love.  [ 46 ] **********In reality, the origin of a human person is the result of an act of giving. The one conceived must be the fruit of his parents' love. He cannot be desired or conceived as the product of an intervention of medical or biological techniques; that would be equivalent to reducing him to an object of scientific technology. No one may subject the coming of a child into the world to conditions of technical efficiency which are to be evaluated according to standards of control and dominion. **********The moral relevance of the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and between the goods of marriage, as well as the unity of the human being and the dignity of his origin, demand that the procreation of a human person be brought about as the fruit of the conjugal act specific to the love between spouses. The link between procreation and the conjugal act is thus shown to be of great importance on the anthropological and moral planes, and it throws light on the positions of the Magisterium with regard to homologous artificial fertilization.  5. Is Homologous 'in Vitro' Fertilization Morally Licit? **********The answer to this question is strictly dependent on the principles just mentioned. Certainly one cannot ignore the legitimate aspirations of sterile couples. For some, recourse to homologous IVF and ET appears to be the only way of fulfilling their sincere desire for a child. The question is asked whether the totality of conjugal life in such situations is not sufficient to insure the dignity proper to human procreation. It is acknowledged that IVF and ET certainly cannot supply for the absence of sexual relations  [ 47 ]  and cannot be preferred to the specific acts of conjugal union, given the risks involved for the child and the difficulties of the procedure. But it is asked whether, when there is no other way of overcoming the sterility which is a source of suffering, homologous in vitro fertilization may not constitute an aid, if not a form of therapy, whereby its moral licitness could be admitted. **********The desire for a child - or at the very least an openness to the transmission of life - is a necessary prerequisite from the moral point of view for responsible human procreation. But this good intention is not sufficient for making a positive moral evaluation of in vitro fertilization between spouses. The process of IVF and ET must be judged in itself and cannot borrow its definitive moral quality from the totality of conjugal life of which it becomes part nor from the conjugal acts which may precede or follow it. [ 48 ] **********It has already been recalled that, in the circumstances in which it is regularly practiced, IVF and ET involves the destruction of human beings, which is something contrary to the doctrine on the illicitness of abortion previously mentioned.  [ 49 ]  But even in a situation in which every precaution were taken to avoid the death of human embryos, homologous IVF and ET dissociates from the conjugal act the actions which are directed to human fertilization. For this reason the very nature of homologous IVF and ET also must be taken into account, even abstracting from the link with procured abortion. **********Homologous IVF and ET is brought about outside the bodies of the couple through actions of third parties whose competence and technical activity determine the success of the procedure. Such fertilization entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children. **********Conception in vitro is the result of the technical action which presides over fertilization. Such fertilization is neither in fact achieved nor positively willed as the expression and fruit of specific act of the conjugal union. In homologous IVF and ET, therefore, even if it is considered in the context of 'de facto' existing sexual relations, the generation of the human person is objectively deprived of its proper perfection: namely, that of being the result and fruit of a conjugal act in which the spouses can become ''cooperators with God for giving life to a new person.''  [ 50 ] **********These reasons enable us to understand why the act of conjugal love is considered in the teaching of the Church as the only setting worthy of human procreation. For the same reasons the so-called ''simple case,'' i.e. a homologous IVF and ET procedure that is free of any compromise with the abortive practice of destroying embryos and with masturbation, remains a technique which is morally illicit because it deprives human procreation of the dignity which is proper and connatural to it. **********Certainly, homologous IVF and ET fertilization is not marked by all that ethical negativity found in extra-conjugal procreation; the family and marriage continue to constitute the setting for the birth and upbringing of the children. Neverthess, in conformity with the traditional doctrine relating to the goods of marriage and the dignity of the person, the Church remain opposed from the moral point of view to homologous 'in vitro' fertilization. Such fertilization is in itself illicit and in opposition to the dignity of procreation and of the conjugal union, even when everything is done to avoid the death of the human embryo. **********Although the manner in which human conception is achieved with IVF and ET cannot be approved, every child which comes into the world must in any case be accepted as a living gift of the divine Goodness and must be brought up with love.  6. How Is Homologous Artifical Insemination to Be Evaluated From the Moral Point of View? **********Homologous artificial insemination within marriage cannot be admitted except for those cases in which the technical means is not a substitute for the conjugal act but serves to facilitate and to help so that the act attains its natural purpose. **********The teaching of the Magisterium on this point has already been stated.  [ 51 ]  This teaching is not just an expression of particular historical circumstances but is based on the Church's doctrine concerning the connection between the conjugal union and procreation and on a consideration of the personal nature of the conjugal act and of a human procreation. ''In its natural structure, the conjugal act is a personal action, a simultaneous and immediate cooperation on the part of the husband and wife, which by the very nature of the agents and the proper nature of the act is the expression of the mutual gift which, according to the words of Scripture, brings about union 'in one flesh.' ''  [ 52 ]  Thus moral conscience ''does not necessarily proscribe the use of certain artificial means destined solely either to the facilitating of the natural act or to insuring that the natural act normally performed achieves its proper end.''  [ 53 ]  If the technical means facilitates the conjugal act or helps it to reach its natural objectives, it can be morally acceptable. If, on the other hand, the procedure were to replace the conjugal act, it is morally illicit. **********Artificial insemination as a substitute for the conjugal act is prohibited by reason of the voluntarily achieved dissociation of the two meanings of the conjugal act. Masturbation, through which the sperm is normally obtained, is another sign of this dissociation: even when it is done for the purpose of procreation, the act remains deprived of its unitive meaning: ''It lacks the sexual relationship called for by the moral order, namely the relationship which realizes 'the full sense of mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love.' ''  [ 54 ] 7. What Moral Criterion Can Be Proposed With Regard to Medical Intervention in Human Procreation? **********The medical act must be evaluated not only with reference to its technical dimension but also and above all in relation to its goal which is the good of persons and their bodily and psychological health. The moral criteria for medical intervention in procreation are deduced from the dignity of human persons, of their sexuality and of their origin. **********Medicine which seeks to be ordered to the integral good of the person must respect the specifically human values of sexuality.  [ 55 ]  The doctor is at the service of persons and of human procreation. He does not have the authority to dispose of them or to decide their fate. A medical intervention respects the dignity of persons when it seeks to assist the conjugal act either in order to facilitate its performance or in order to enable it to achieve its objective once it has been normally performed.  [ 56 ] **********On the other hand, it sometimes happens that a medical procedure technologically replaces the conjugal act in order to obtain a procreation which is neither its result nor its fruit. In this case the medical act is not, as it should be, at the service of conjugal union but rather appropriates to itself the procreative function and thus contradicts the dignity and the inalienable rights of the spouses and of the child to be born. **********The humanization of medicine, which is insisted upon today by everyone, requires respect for the integral dignity of the human person first of all in the act and at the moment in which the spouses transmit life to a new person. It is only logical therefore to address an urgent appeal to Catholic doctors and scientists that they bear exemplary witness to the respect due to the human embryo and to the dignity of procreation. The medical and nursing staff of Catholic hospitals and clinics are in a special way urged to do justice to the moral obligations which they have assumed, frequently also, as part of their contract. Those who are in charge of Catholic hospitals and clinics and who are often Religious will take special care to safeguard and promote a diligent observance of the moral norms recalled in the present Instruction.  8. The Suffering Caused By Infertility in Marriage **********The suffering of spouses who cannot have children or who are afraid of bringing a handicapped child into the world is a suffering that everyone must understand and properly evaluate. **********On the part of the spouses, the desire for a child is natural: it expresses the vocation to fatherhood and motherhood inscribed in conjugal love. This desire can be even stronger if the couple is affected by sterility which appears incurable. Nevertheless, marriage does not confer upon the spouses the right to have a child, but only the right to perform those natural acts which are per se ordered to procreation.  [ 57 ] **********A true and proper right to a child would be contrary to the child's dignity and nature. The child is not an object to which one has a right, nor can he be considered as an object of ownership: rather, a child is a gift, ''the supreme gift''  [ 58 ]  and the most gratuitous gift of marriage, and is a living testimony of the mutual giving of his parents. For this reason, the child has the right, as already mentioned, to be the fruit of the specific act of the conjugal love of his parents; and he also has the right to be respected as a person from the moment of his conception. **********Nevertheless, whatever its cause or prognosis, sterility is certainly a difficult trial. The community of believers is called to shed light upon and support the suffering of those who are unable to fulfill their legitimate aspiration to motherhood and fatherhood. Spouses who find themselves in this sad situation are called to find in it an opportunity for sharing in a particular way in the Lord's Cross, the source of spiritual fruitfulness. Sterile couples must not forget that ''even when procreation is not possible, conjugal life does not for this reason lose its value. Physical sterility in fact can be for spouses the occasion for other important services to the life of the human person, for example, adoption, various forms of educational work, and assistance to other families and to poor or handicapped children.''  [ 59 ] **********Many researchers are engaged in the fight against sterility. While fully safeguarding the dignity of human procreation, some have achieved results which previously seemed unattainable. Scientists therefore are to be encouraged to continue their research with the aim of preventing the causes of sterility and of being able to remedy them so that sterile couples will be able to procreate in full respect for their own personal dignity and that of the child to be born.  * By the term heterologous artificial fertilization or procreation, the Instruction means techniques used to obtain a human conception artificially by the use of gametes coming from at least one donor other than the spouses who are joined in marriage. Such techniques can be of two types: **********a) Heterologous IVF and ET: the technique used to obtain a human conception through the meeting in vitro of gametes taken from at least one donor other than the two spouses joined in marriage. **********b) heterologous artificial insemination: the technique used to obtain a human conception through the transfer into the genital tracts of the woman of the sperm previously collected from a donor other than the husband.  ** By artificial homologous fertilization or procreation, the Instruction means the technique used to obtain a human conception using the gametes of the two spouses joined in marriage. Homologous artificial fertilization can be carried out by two different methods: **********a) Homologous IVF and ET: the technique used to obtain a human conception through the meeting in vitro of the gametes of the spouses joined in marriage. **********b) Homologous artificial insemination: the technique used to obtain a human conception through the transfer into the genital tracts of a married woman of the sperm previously collected from her husband.  * By ''surrogate mother'' the Instruction means: **********a) the woman who carries in pregnancy an embryo implanted in her uterus and who is genetically a stranger to the embryo because it has been obtained through the union of the gametes of ''donors.'' She carries the pregnancy with a pledge to surrender the baby once it is born to the party who commissioned or made the agreement for the pregnancy. **********b) the woman who carries in pregnancy an embryo to whose procreation she has contributed the donation of her own ovum, fertilized through insemination with the sperm of a man other than her husband. She carries the pregnancy with a pledge to surrender the child once it is born to the party who commissioned or made the agreement for the pregnancy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/01/world/seoul-government-and-opposition-reach-agreement-on-constitution.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1987-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1056, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seoul Government and Opposition Reach Agreement on Constitution", "print_headline": "Seoul Government and Opposition Reach Agreement on Constitution", "body_text": " **********South Korea's two main political parties agreed today on the basic outline of a new constitution, a settlement that clears the way for the first direct elections here in 16 years. **********The agreement represented the most substantial political achievement since President Chun Doo Hwan succumbed to protests two months ago and accepted sweeping democratic changes demanded by the opposition. **********But despite its significance, the accord did not dissolve the basic mistrust between the two sides, or to end the labor unrest that continued today with strikes at more than 600 work sites. Detentions Are Noted **********Kim Young Sam, the main opposition party leader, warned that the Government had started a fresh crackdown on dissidents and said that 330 people remained in jail on politically related charges despite Mr. Chun's pledge to release political prisoners. **********To protest a spurt of arrests in the last few days, Mr. Kim called off a scheduled meeting today with the ruling party president, Roh Tae Woo. **********Despite such acrimony, an eight-member committee of negotiators from the two parties did something today that Koreans themselves acknowledge is a rarity in their politics: They compromised. Weakening the Presidency **********They resolved differences on the president's tenure by settling on a single term of five years. The document does not deal with the mechanics of the electoral process - that is to be left to subsequent legislation - but the president basically will be the person who gets the most popular votes. **********Compared with the almost unlimited power that Mr. Chun has commanded during his seven-year term, the next South Korean President will be somewhat weaker. The new constitution would abolish his right to dissolve the National Assembly, give lawmakers the right to investigate government affairs and introduce new legal rights, including that of habeas corpus. **********On one sensitive issue, minimum voting age, the ruling Democratic Justice Party and the opposition Reunification Democratic Party could not agree. The ruling camp wanted to retain the present minimum age of 20, while the anti-Government forces demanded that it be lowered to 19, their assumption being that they would appeal more to younger voters. **********Committee members decided finally that the parties could settle the matter when, as required, they write new election laws. **********Still, the spirit of compromise was much in evidence, and both sides could point to important concessions. The opposition abandoned demands for the creation of the post of vice president and for a reference in the charter's preamble to the 1980 massacre by Government troops in the city of Kwangju. For its part, the ruling side agreed to a clause - although not in the preamble, as the opposition had requested - calling on the military to stay out of politics. **********That provision will say, ''The armed forces take it as their duty to perform the sacred duty of national security and territorial defense, and their political neutrality shall be observed.'' Mid-December Vote Foreseen **********Now the agreement goes to still another panel, which will prepare a document in formal language and then present that draft to the National Assembly for required approval by a two-thirds vote. It must then be ratified by a simple majority in a national referendum expected in October. **********Political analysts said they did not envision significant changes, and they predicted that the revised charter would be adopted with relative ease. When South Korea will actually experience its first free elections since 1971 is still not clear, but mid-December is frequently mentioned as probable. **********The new president would take office next Feb. 25, assuming that Mr. Chun keeps his pledge to step down after a single seven-year term. **********Negotiators for both sides were under pressure to reach a quick settlement. In particular, they wanted to finish their business before college students return to their campuses in a few days and, undoubtedly, resume their anti-Government protests. A Remarkable Change in Course **********The agreement signifies a remarkable change in South Korea's political landscape in only a few months. As recently as early June, Mr. Chun had designated his old ally and fellow former general, Roh Tae Woo, to be his successor, fully expecting him to take power under the Constitution promulgated soon after they seized power in a military uprising more than seven years ago. **********The existing charter calls for the president to be chosen indirectly by an electoral college - a system widely said to be unfairly tilted in the ruling camp's favor. **********Kim Young Sam and another prominent anti-Government figure, Kim Dae Jung, insist that they will unite behind a single candidate even though both seem interested in running. **********Kim Dae Jung got some help through today's compromise when negotiators dropped a provision from the present Constitution that requires the president to have lived in South Korea for the last five years. That would have eliminated Mr. Kim, who lived in virtual exile in the United States from late 1982 to early 1985. Human Rights Provisions **********Human rights and labor matters are touched on only in broad outline in the new charter, which will be the eighth revision of the South Korean constitution since the first one was adopted in 1948. **********The government may, as now, seize anyone who had once been convicted of a serious crime, such as espionage, if the authorities judge him to be a danger to the state. The opposition had wanted such so-called ''probationary supervision'' to be ordered only by the courts, but the agreement says that it may be imposed as ''prescribed by laws and under due legal procedure.'' **********The draft constitution would also prohibit censorship of plays and other public performances and would guarantee workers' rights to collective bargaining except in defense-related industries. But those rights exist in the present Constitution, honored more in the breach by the Chun Government. **********To reach a compromise, the opposition dropped a demand for a clause calling on company managers to share profits with workers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/business/in-quotes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN QUOTES", "print_headline": "IN QUOTES", "body_text": " **********''I made a fortune and lost a large part of it, and now I've got to hunker down.''

Competing With Giants **********Indeed, the most immediate challenge facing Mr. Stern, who is chairman of both Bull and the Honeywell Bull joint venture, is avoiding being trampled by two other computer powers: giant International Business Machines and Digital Equipment, the Maynard, Mass., company that has been dazzling the market with its new array of products. **********Bull, which dominates the consortium, must still prove that it can compete on the merits of its technology rather than its political connections.

Moreover, with Honeywell's survival in computers in question for so long, many key customers and employees abandoned what they thought was a sinking ship. 'Very Late in the Game' **********''It's not quite a long shot for the joint venture to turn things around, but it's very late in the game to be starting over,'' said George F. Colony, a consultant with Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. **********Mr. Stern readily acknowledges that Honeywell Bull has its problems, including a dispirited marketing staff. Still, he is unfazed by the doomsayers. Many people were similarly pessimistic about Bull when the French Government named him head of the state-controlled company in 1982, Mr. Stern recalled. **********Now, he is confident that he can revive Honeywell's computer business by using many of the strategies he used to resuscitate Bull. Indeed, the new joint venture has already stopped the market-share slide in the United States, he asserted. How? Just by persuading customers that its owners are committed to staying in the business, according to Mr. Stern. **********''When you invest in the computers, you want to make sure you choose the right vendor, someone who will be around for the long term,'' he said. ''Our joint venture has reassured customers because they see we are committed to the business.'' **********Not that such commitment is enough to insure Honeywell Bull'ssurvival in a world were I.B.M. is king, said the 55-year-old Mr. Stern, who ran his own successful software company before joining Bull. **********Still, Mr. Stern is hoping that Honeywell Bull - and the Bull-NEC-Honeywell alliance - can capitalize on computer users' fears of a world in which the only choice might be I.B.M. Many users also want ''open systems'' - or ones capable of tying together equipment from four or five companies. **********''One of our strategic choices is to be open to other suppliers,'' said Francis Lorentz, Bull's chief operating officer and Mr. Stern's right-hand man. ''We think customers want freedom. They don't want to be trapped by one supplier.'' **********Mr. Stern also hopes to capitalize on the increasing importance of distributed data processing and networking - or the movement by computer users to replace the big, central mainframe computer with an array of smaller computers that are tied together. Turnkey Systems Stressed **********Finally, Mr. Stern does not want Honeywell Bull simply to sell computers. Rather, he wants it to provide customers with so-called turnkey systems - or complete hardware-software packages tailored to solve customers' specific problems. **********Jerome J. Meyer, the longtime Honeywell manager who is Minneapolis-based Honeywell Bull's chief executive, sees eye to eye with his French colleagues on this strategy. ''A lot of customers do not want to talk about the need for more processors or more memory but about 'How do I link my three plants together? or How do I get rid of my inventory bulge?' '' the 49-year-old Mr. Meyer said. **********These strategies are hardly radical. Almost every major computer company in the world now asserts it is a maker of systems that offer total solutions, rather than just computers. **********Still, in Europe, Bull is one of the acknowledged leaders in marketing open systems, networking and turnkey solutions. Indeed, it has been in the forefront of pushing European computer makers to adopt international standards so computers made by different companies can be tied together. **********The big question, of course, is whether Honeywell Bull can do the same in the United States, where Digital, in particular, has been successfully taking the same approach? **********Indeed, many analysts say that Mr. Stern may find the going a lot tougher in the United States than in Europe. ''Stern has been a good, hard-hitting, no-nonsense chief executive who has understood the European markets well,'' said Ann Courtright, research director for the Yankee Group, the Boston-based market-research and consulting concern. ''But the American markets are different; they are much more competitive. In Europe, you compete against I.B.M. In America, you compete against I.B.M., Digital and a lot of smart, well-financed start-ups like Apollo.'' **********For that reason, Honeywell Bull needs to be a strong marketer - a talent it has lacked. ''They haven't shown the superaggressive marketing you need to take accounts from I.B.M. or Digital,'' Ms. Courtright said. **********Mr. Stern said he planned to devote a lot of his energies to revitalizing Honeywell Bull's marketing staff. But he also stressed that Honeywell Bull had its strengths, including its base of 10,000 Honeywell customers. **********Bull and Honeywell Bull's market strengths also complement each other, he said, noting that, while Bull is strong in serving the Government and banking and insurance industries, Honeywell is important in manufacturing. **********''Honeywell's installed base is large enough to support a satisfactory growth rate provided the new company can keep coming up with cost-effective, up-to-date products,'' said Ulrich Weil, a Washington-based analyst. Competitive Products Needed **********But many analysts wonder whether Honeywell Bull can come up with competitive products when Honeywell itself could not. In response, Mr. Meyer, Honeywell Bull's chief executive, said the joint venture, as part of the Bull-NEC-Honeywell alliance, had the size and critical mass that Honeywell alone lacked. **********The joint venture will start with $2 billion in revenues, while Bull, the dominant owner with a 42.5 percent share, has revenues of $3 billion. (Honeywell also has a 42.5 percent stake, but under the terms of the agreement, Bull will increase its share to 65.1 percent and Honeywell's will drop to 19.9 percent in two years. NEC owns the remaining 15 percent.) Mr. Meyer said the joint venture could cut costs by consolidating factories and product lines and teaming up with Bull and NEC in research and development. NEC will focus on developing top-of-the-line mainframes, and the joint venture will spend about $500 million a year developing the rest of the computer line. **********Some industry experts caution, however, that getting the three partners to cooperate might not be so easy. Martyn Roetter, a computer consultant with Arthur D. Little, said, ''Meyer has to balance the interests of three different owners, and he has to be able to extract from the three owners the money and resources to insure'' the joint venture ''can get the kind of marketing and products it needs.'' Difficulty Downplayed **********Mr. Meyer and Mr. Stern play down the difficulty of this task, noting that the three companies have a long history of cooperating and are eager for the joint venture to work. **********Indeed, Honeywell was a major Bull shareholder before Bull was nationalized. Bull's leaders also point out that Honeywell, Bull and NEC have long shared technologies and marketed many of one other's products. ''It will be easier for us to tie our product lines together than it would be for two competing companies that merge, like Sperry and Burroughs,'' Mr. Stern said.  Bull officials said they had long wanted to expand outside of France, and they seized the opportunity when Honeywell decided to reduce its role in computers. Bull officials saw expanding beyond France as crucial to Bull's achieving the critical mass and economies of scale they believed it needed to survive in computers. **********Honeywell, which did not sell the military part of its computer business, received $527 million in the deal, 28 percent below book value. Bull paid $131 million. NEC, which wanted to strengthen its marketing presence in the United States, paid $46 million. And Honeywell Bull gave Honeywell $350 million in the form of a negotiated loan. **********If the Honeywell deal had come along a few years ago, Bull could never have pursued it. At current exchange rates, Bull lost $198 million in 1982 and about $100 million a year in 1983 and 1984. But thanks to Mr. Stern's strategies, Bull earned $18 million in 1985 and $45 million last year. **********When it looked as if Bull would go under in 1982, the French Government - interested in saving 20,000 jobs and the French computer industry - acquired most of Bull's shares. Bull had almost $1 billion in debt, and no bank was willing to lend it more to tide it over. **********Since 1982, the Government has pumped $600 million into Bull and has left Mr. Stern alone to chart its strategy. Now the company, which is scheduled for to be sold to the public sometime after 1988, is estimated to be worth $1.2 billion. So the Government stands to make a respectable profit. **********Now Mr. Stern hopes he can make a respectable profit on his investment in Honeywell Bull.

Authorized by Congress in 1983 after a heated debate, Radio Marti began broadcasting to Cuba in May 1985. **********Ms. Inclan's charges were denied by Michael W. McGuire, spokesman for the Voice of America, which under the law is responsible for Radio Marti's programming. ''What Ms. Inclan says about Radio Marti's intelligence gathering is completely false,'' he said.

He said that two of the most successful programs beamed to Cuba, one on AIDS and the other on housing conditions on the island, were the result of both research and reporting. **********Speaking at a news conference, Ms. Inclan said that after April she noted that interviews by her reporters with Cuban refugees arriving by boats in Miami were not put on the air.

McFarlane explained how the Administration's policy unfolded and gave his first extensive comments on the contra-supply operation. Here, as recorded by The New York Times, are excerpts from his testimony.  OPENING STATEMENT **********In the six months since the Iran-contra controversy erupted, many people have come to believe there is something wrong with the way that this country makes foreign policy. They probably don't know how wrong.  * * * **********Failures like those in the Iran-contra affair do not happen every day. But on any policy issue where party or ideological interest diverge substantially, the system is becoming increasingly subject to incoherence or paralysis.   $ ? * * * **********Individual mistakes, including my own, should of course be identified. But a solution to the fundamental problems that led to these investigations will require much more. It will require reform of institutions and processes. And most important, it will require change in the attitudes and behavior of the men and women who hold and exercise public power.   $ ? * * * **********A thorough and concerted analysis of our Nicaraguan problem would have produced a clear definition of U.S. interests in Nicaragua and identification of threats to those interests . . . But this type of fundamental Government-wide analysis was never made. Therefore, in December 1981, when the C.I.A. presented a proposal for initiating covert action in Nicaragua, there was no framework within which to analyze it. . . . **********There's little doubt in my mind that if we could not muster an effective counter to the Cuban-Sandinista strategy in our own backyard, it was far less likely that we could do so in the years ahead in more distant locations. There's a corollary to that proposition: For if we did prevail in Nicaragua, the President might go far toward inhibiting Soviet pursuit of this strategy in other areas. In short, there was a powerful and, to many, persuasive case that to lose in Nicaragua would invite the Soviets to step up their investment in aggression significantly in other developing nations of the world. We had to win this one. **********And this is where the Administration made its first mistake. For if we had such a large strategic stake, it was clearly unwise to rely on covert activity as the core of our policy. **********There are two basic reasons for this. The first is that you can never achieve a sufficient level of resources through a covert policy to cope with a determined effort backed by the Soviet Union. . . . The other reason . . . is that you cannot get public and Congressional support for such a policy. **********If you decide to engage in conflict with a Soviet client in whom the Russians are prepared to make a substantial investment, you must have the American people and the U.S. Congress solidly behind you. Yet it is virtually impossible, almost as a matter of definition, to rally public support behind a policy that you can't even talk about.  * * * **********The President repeatedly made it clear in public and in private that he did not intend to break faith with the contras. He directed that we continue, make continued efforts, to bring the movement into the good graces of Congress and the American people, and that we assure the contras of continuing Administration support, to help them hold body and soul together until the time when Congress would again agree to support them. **********Congressional restrictions made it impractical for either the Defense Department or the Central Intelligence Agency to function even as liaison with the contras. The State Department has always been disinclined to be associated with a covert action. But the President had made clear that he wanted a job done. The net result was that the job fell to the National Security Council staff. **********I think it's fair to say that this occurrence was not an example of an N.S.C. staff eagerly grabbing power from other departments and agencies. In the case of the contra operations, the N.S.C. was the agency of last resort. And it was not the right agency, as subsequent history clearly revealed. **********To carry out the President's wishes, I relied on two staff officers: Donald Fortier, now deceased, director of the political-military affairs division, and one of his deputies, Lieut. Col. Oliver North, whose existing responsibilities included Latin American military affairs. **********I told Mr. Fortier, who had a long, long experience in legislative relations, to oversee the effort to gain Congressional support. **********I told Colonel North to do two things. The first was to be a visible sign of the President's strong personal support, to show the contras that they would not be forgotten or abandoned, even though we could not provide them with financial support. **********The second, more specific, responsibility I gave Colonel North was to help the contras in their efforts to become a real political movement, genuinely respecting democratic principles and human rights. **********I did make a special point of stressing to my staff that we were to operate at all times within the law. And that, in particular, we were not to solicit, encourage, coerce or otherwise broker financial contributions to the contras.  $ ? * * * **********I regret, and I will continue to regret, the mistakes that I have made. But I must say this: The policy makers who create conditions like this must bear some of the moral responsibility for the failures that follow. **********We need a truce. We need a willingness once more to forge bipartisan coalitions that can govern responsibly. We need this incident, perhaps, to shock us into realizing that our short-sighted behavior could well take the country to the brink of disaster. **********Finally, we need to see that the present practices threaten to destroy our position of leadership among allies and put at risk even our ability to provide for own security.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  A Country Called 2 **********ARTHUR L. LIMAN. Did you, in fact, succeed in obtaining money from another country, which we'll call Country 2? A. That's correct.  Q. And would you tell the committee how that happened? **********A. . . . The meetings that I held with the officials from Country 2 occurred about quarterly in my office, or in his, or at home. And in these meetings we would discuss . . . foremostly the region of the world where this country was resident - located; concerns that it had about its relationship with the United States, hopes that it had about assistance we could provide, in some arms sales and any of the dozen kinds of bilateral cooperation that was on his mind at the time... **********I would talk about some of our concerns about them and generally we would expand to talk about more distant countries and generally how the President was faring in his policies globally, politically at home and abroad... **********I did in fact make clear that it looked as though we were headed for a substantial setback - a defeat -regarding Congressional support for the contras . . . and because of that it would represent a substantial loss for the President. . . . **********He weighed that. He agreed. He said he would like to think about it and did so within a matter of days - two or three days, contacted me and made clear that he intended to provide a contribution of a million dollars per month, ostensibly from private funds, that would be devoted to - as a humanitarian gesture - to subsistence of the contras through the end of the year.   $ ? * * *  The Inner Circle **********Q. And when did you tell the President about this? And what did you tell him? **********A. I expect it was within a day - no more than a couple of days unless we were traveling - and in that meeting with the President I provided to him in writing a note card which made clear that Country 2 had chosen to volunteer some $1 million per month through the end of the year for contra subsistance. And after that meeting was over, I was called to come back and pick up the notecard which, as I recall it, expressed the President's satisfaction and pleasure that this had occurred. **********Q. Did you do it by slipping a notecard in there because you did not want to communicate it orally in the presence of others who were in the briefing meeting? **********A. That's correct.  $ ? * * * **********Q. Did you communicate to anyone else at that time besides Admiral Poindexter and the President that Country 2 had made this contribution? **********A. I believe within a day or so I also communicated it to the Vice President personally. **********Q. Did you communicate it to the Secretary of State at that time? **********A. I had a pattern of weekly breakfasts with the Secretaries of State and Defense with the three of us, our deputies and directors of political-military affairs usually, and at an early meeting on one of those Wednesdays following this episode, the question came up by one of those Cabinet officers and I drew them aside at the end of that breakfast and told them that it had been provided for through the end of the year. And neither gentleman pressed the matter further. **********Q. Did you tell them which country had provided for it through the end of the year? A. No, I did not.  Q. Did either Secretary ask you which country provided it? **********A. No, they did not.  * * *  Walking a Fine Line **********Q. Tell us exactly what kind of support you were to assure the contras of, during this period when you were prohibited from spending any money to support them. **********A. Well, basically it was smoke and mirrors. It was a matter of trying to demonstrate, simply by the presence of a White House person, someone close enough to the President to achieve, simply by dint of the proximity, credibility with the contra leaders . . . **********But I also made very clear that this has to be done within the law. and because I took the law to express what I had gotten personally from a number of members of Congress and the Senate, that we're cutting off money for the contras and we don't want any money raised for the contras, and bringing an end, really, to the contra movement and campaign was their purpose, through the purse string. **********Q. Now, you gave instructions to Colonel North on what he was supposed to do? **********A. Yes I did. * * * **********Q. Did you put any limitations on what Colonel North should do with respect to the contras? **********A. Only to stay within the law and to be particularly careful not to be associated with or take part in any fund-raising activities. **********Q. And did you tell him that he was not, as your statement indicates, to broker any contributions, or solicit contributions, or encourage contributions? **********A. It became a kind of litany of mine in staff meetings: solicit, encourage, coerce or broker. And it was applicable to everyone on the staff.   $ ? * * *  Doubling the Ante **********A. I was advised by a resident official of Country 2 that . . . they, Country 2, had elected to carry on with their contributions they had made but to be at about double the monthly level it had been in the previous year. **********Hearing of that, I advised the President, within a day or so . . . **********Q. Now, let's go over this again. The amount this time at $2 million a month was roughly $24 million, $25 million? Is that what you understood you were being offered? **********A. That is correct. I heard both figures mentioned later but soon after that news was reported to me by the foreign official, the Secretary of Defense here and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs also told me they had heard the same thing, but their figure was 25. * * * **********Q. The Secretary of Defense told you he had heard about it directly? Am I correct? A. Yes sir. **********Q. . . . And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told you he knew of it? A. That's correct. Q. All right, did you tell the Secretary of State? **********A. No, I did not at that time. Later. * * * **********Q. The truth is that you didn't until sometime around June of 1986, is that correct? **********A. That's correct, yes sir. * * * **********Q. Why not tell the Secretary of State? A. Well, there's no reason not to.  Q. Well, what was in your mind, in terms of not telling him? **********A. Well, I think it was probably oversight, Mr. Liman, just error on my part. I had no personal inhibition about telling him. I think I should have. Q. Did you tell the D.C.I.? A. No I didn't. **********Q. Is it a fact that you regarded this source of funding as a matter to be held as a closely held secret? **********A. Yes I did.   $ ? * * * **********Q. And what about the Vice President? Did you feel obliged to tell him also? **********A. I'm not certain it was my habit to do that, but the Vice President was privy to whatever the President knew. . . .  Quid for a Quo **********Q. Were you uncomfortable about receiving the money from a third country? **********A. Well I believed strongly that we could not, and should not, expect to sustain the policy with this kind of support and that this had to be the last time. **********Q. Were you uncomfortable that you might be creating some implicit quid for a quo? **********A. Yes. You always have to consider what is it that you may invite by way of reciprocal gesture or concession. What obligation do you incur for having had some contribution of this kind, yes. **********Q. And as I understand the line that you were drawing, you couldn't come right out and say, ''I want a contribution?'' Am I correct? That would be a solicitation? A. That's correct. Q. But you could express the concerns about the fact that the contras were running out of funds? A. That's correct. Q. And if, in response to those concerns, the foreign leader offered the money, you could tell him where to deposit it? **********A. Well of course when it was legal the previous summer, he would have known that, so. **********Q. But you could tell him, ''thank you,'' when he offered it in February? **********A. Yes. * * *  A North Memo **********Q. After you received this memorandum from Oliver North in which he proposed going back to the Country 2 for $25 to $30 million, do you recall that you discussed the subject of third-country funding with the D.C.I., Mr. Casey? A. I don't believe I did, no.  Q. . . . Maybe this will refresh your recollection. Would you look at 36-A? Which is a memorandum of a meeting that you had with the director, prepared by his office. The meeting was March 21, and the North memorandum to you was dated March 16.  $ ? * * * **********Here you're being told by the director that if you rely on third countries for lethal support for the contras and it gets out, Congress could penalize those countries as well as the contras. Right?  A. Yes. **********Q. And you acknowledge that that was a serious issue. A. Uh huh.  Q. And that you would leave it to the President to decide. A. Yes.  Q. Did you bring it to the President? Do you have any recollection of that, sir? A. I know that I did not.  Q. Then why did you tell the D.C.I. that you were going to leave it to the President and not do it? **********A. Well, first, you assume that this is an accurate record there. It's the first time I've seen this document . . . **********I normally disagreed with the director on how a given matter ought to be taken on and promoted with the Congress. And I also found that it didn't do very much good to argue about it. And that the easy way to resolve a given conflict was just to acknowledge that the only way you're going to solve this is elevate it to the boss. Well, that would always at least get us on to the next agenda item.  * * *  On Playing God **********Q. Did there come a time when you received a call from an Israeli representative telling you that as a result an American hostage would be allowed to go free? * * * **********A. It was a report from Mr. Kimche in Israel that as a practical matter they had run into difficulties with the Iranian intermediaries - that nonetheless he believed that while his expectations that all hostages would be released had not been fulfilled or would not be fulfilled, that we ought to continue the dialogue with them anyway and that the United States could expect one hostage to be released within a couple of days. His call must have been on or about the 10th to 12th of September. **********Q. Were you asked to play God and choose one hostage? **********A. Yes. And I asked for Mr. Buckley. **********Q. And that was a subject of some anguish to be put in the position of having to choose? A. Yes. Q. And it brought home to you, I take it, what it really meant to be negotiating for hostages? **********A. Well it was very clear that this was not the kind of exchange that was proper. **********Q. And did you report to the President that as a result of the Israeli shipment, a hostage would be released? A. Yes, I did. Q. And you told him ultimately that it was Mr. Weir? **********A. Yes, I did.  * * *  Learning of Diversion **********Q. Did you have a discussion with Colonel North about the proceeds of the sale? **********A. Not truly a discussion, if you're referring to the tarmac exchange. That's a very short bit of news that I learned. **********Q. Where did it occur? And tell us in your own words what you recall of what Colonel North said. **********A. Well, we left Teheran in the morning, Teheran time . . . We got on the plane and went back to Israel. And upon arrival . . . the others in my party were unloading the baggage and personal effects from the aircraft. **********And I suppose I was obviously dispirited by the events in Teheran. And Colonel North, I think in an effort to be supportive, mentioned to me offhandedly that I shouldn't count it a total loss; that we are applying some of the funds from the Iranian connection to Central America, or words to that effect. **********And I was a little startled.  * * * **********A. Upon hearing Colonel North's statement that we don't have a problem, I said, you've got a problem with that channeling of money to the contras.   $ ? * * * **********Q. And when you said you have problem, what did you mean? What kind of problem? **********A. It just seemed to me that unless someone could stand up and say that this is on the basis of a finding, or is chartered by specific decision by the Admiral or the President, that I could not imagine this kind of thing being justified in law, or at least not that I had heard of. And - Q. Now, yet this was the same thing he told you originally in Teheran? A. Or on the tarmac, yes, in Israel.  Q. On the tarmac in Israel. And now some months later, you're telling him that he's got a problem and you can't imagine, unless there was some kind of finding or other authority that this would be lawful. Right? **********A.

In the 12 trading days of this year, the average has climbed 206 points, or almost 11 percent. **********With yesterday's 25.87-point rise, to 2,102.50, the average matched a previous record of 12 consecutive advances, set in 1970 from Nov. 19 through Dec. 7. **********''Only a fool would try to predict when this market is going to top out.'' said Larry Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities. 'Loads of Fresh Cash' **********He added that ''people can argue about the economic outlook all they want,'' but the fact is that ''loads of fresh cash'' - from mutual funds and pension funds and from overseas investors - ''flood the market every day.'' **********In addition, individual investors are cautiously beginning to buy stocks on their own for the first time in several years. **********Compared with last week's record turnovers, trading paled yesterday, on the holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 162.8 million shares, but far below last Friday's turnover of 218.4 million, and the record 253.1 million shares that changed hands the previous day. But market analysts said individual and institutional investors were no less enthusiastic than last week. Superbulls and Nervousness **********The tremendous leap of this year has stunned Wall Street. While it has converted some professionals into superbulls it has also created nervousness. William M. LeFevre, senior vice president and market strategist at Advest Inc., said that ''it took only seven trading days for this market to go from 2,000 to 2,100. Back in February-March of 1986, it took 21 days each for the Dow to go from 1,600 to 1,700 and from 1,700 to 1,800. If this doesn't signal some kind of blow-off, then I don't know what does.'' **********But Steven G. Einhorn, a partner in Goldman, Sachs & Company, disagreed with the view that the market had peaked out, saying: ''The whole economy is awash in liquidity, courtesy of the Federal Reserve. Also, the continues to flow into the equity market. Then we have the foreign investors, who were the largest single buyers of stocks in 1986, some $25 billion or five times what they invested here in 1985.'' **********Another market optimist is Anthony Ludovici, senior investment analyst at Tucker, Anthony & R. L. Day Inc. ''From a technical point of view we are extremely happy that the Dow's transport index reached its second record level in a row,'' he said. ''This confirms the validity of the Dow industrial average.'' **********But the best reasons for being bullish, Mr. Ludovici said, ''was that the market since mid-1982 has been in its first 'super cycle' since the 1920's. By comparison, the wild 'go-go' years of the late 1960's was nothing more than a good market.'' **********And even naysayers were hedging their bets. One usually outspoken analyst, who asked not to be identified, said: ''I don't like markets that shoot up on declining volume. Nor the fact that today's gainers were only twice as large as the losers, or that gold has been rising with the market. But I'm not shorting this market.'' Investors sell shares ''short'' in expectation of a price decline. Since the first of the year, those who have sold the market short have been among the biggest losers in the market, according to brokers. 'Uncertainty About Economy' **********The seeds of the stock rally may have been planted in the second half of last year when the market idled after a strong rise. At that time, ''many investors who were uncertain about the impact of the new tax rules as well as the economy stayed on the sidelines,'' said Monte Gordon, research chief at the Dreyfus Corporation. But today, he added, ''all that remains is the uncertainty about the economy.'' Predictions of sluggish growth satisfy Wall Street because that pace would restrain inflation. **********During the 1970 rise for 12 consecutive days, the Dow Jones average climbed 8.5 percent, to 818.66, on the strength of an economy that was bounding forward. **********On the Big Board yesterday, 1,057 stocks closed higher, while 576 declined. The Dow Jones transportation average jumped 10.30 points, to 882.51, also a record. Many analysts took that as a confirmation of the Dow's surge. A record was also set by the Dow utilities average, which rose 0.52 point, to 223.34. **********The Standard & Poor's index of 500 blue chips, which is the favorite of professional investors, jumped 3.06 points, to a record 269.34. Sharp Pullback at Start **********Stocks pulled back sharply at the start of trading yesterday, throwing an extension of the market's winning streak into doubt, with the Dow average off 19 points. Profit taking was one factor as well as initial uneasiness over the dollar, which continued to fall sharply. **********But the focus on the positive aspects of the weaker dollar again replaced concern that foreigners may begin to shun American securities if the currency weakens too dramatically. The falling dollar should help the profitability of American companies by helping them meet foreign competition. A cheap dollar makes imports more expensive and exports to other nations cheaper. **********A strong surge in technology shares also revived the market. **********Analysts noted that, during the 12-day rally, each time the market has backed off eager buyers flooded in to bargain-hunt and to make up for lost buying opportunities. There have been few such chances. **********''We began with a little bit of a correction this morning, but I still would not bet against this market,'' James Andrews of Janney Montgomery Scott said. I.B.M. Earnings Due Today **********The market advance was led by such movers of the Dow average as International Business Machines, which jumped 5 1/4, to 125 1/4, on a turnover of 2.7 million shares. I.B.M.'s results for the fourth quarter of 1986 are due today. Several analysts said the giant computer company's earnings might be better than expected. But they attributed I.B.M.'s strong gain to general market conditions as well as the higher earnings reported yesterday by two other computer makers. **********American Telephone and Telegraph was second on the active list, rising 3/4, to 26 3/4. Owens-Illinois, involved in a takeover situation, added 3 1/2 at 59. Digital Equipment, reflecting the strong computer group, climbed 6, to 143, while National Semiconductor rose 5/8, to 14 1/8, and Hewlett-Packard added 4 at 54. **********The only minuses on the active list were Pan Am, off 1/4, to 5 3/4, and Boeing, down 1/4, to 50 3/4. **********Gold shares were active as bullion prices increased.

Home Shopping Network jumped by 12, to 65, and led the Amex's most active list on a turnover of 972,500 shares.

Those not content merely to take their gains and run are often forced to ride out the storms of a highly volatile market, hoping that the latest trough is not the start of a prolonged slump. Some brokers argue that such investors can have their cake and eat it too, by hedging their portfolios with put options. Such options give investors the right to sell a stock at a particular price over a set time frame, and will normally increase in value as an underlying stock sags. **********But others say that a put strategy - because of the starting costs, the commissions and often crucial timing involved - can make a bad situation worse. These naysayers contend that for the average small investor - whose talent at calling market turns is notably imperfect - hedging with options is more a broker's dream than a customer's. **********Even for options that appear low-priced, the cost for an individual investor to buy this kind of ''insurance'' can run prohibitively high. **********Both the potential and costs of the game can be seen in a recent trade that one New York broker put through for a client. On Jan. 23, with shares of the Walt Disney Company at $56.38, the February 55 Disney put option was quoted at $1.25 (or $125 per 100 shares, as the puts are sold). The put - a right to sell the stock at $55 a share - protected an investor against any decline below $55. Three days later, Disney had sunk as low as $52.38 and the put had risen as high as $3.50 ($350). Thus a holder of 1,000 shares of Disney lost $4,000 as the stock fell, but recouped $2,250 in appreciation of the put, before commissions. For an investor with a heavy Disney position and a nimble sense of market timing, that could be a good trade. But it is a rare outcome, according to other professionals. Indeed, within days, Disney had recovered to $56.50, and the put had fallen back to 88 cents. **********A holder of just 100 shares, however, would have fared much less happily. The loss on the stock would be $400, partly offset by a $225 gain on the put option. But round-trip brokerage commissions of at least $70 would cut that benefit to $155. The small Disney investor who hedged at an almost perfect time still would have a net loss on the total position - the stock and the put - of $245, 61 percent of what would have been lost without ''insurance.'' **********The strategy, said the broker who recommended it - a vice president at a major wire house - is suitable for ''short-term time frames, when the output of dollars is at the lowest'' and the market appears most vulnerable. The price of the put, at $1.25, was ''reasonable,'' he added. Yet unless Disney drops below $55 by the expiration, Feb. 21 - the cost of the put plus the commission will be lost. Is that a ''reasonable'' price for a nervous investor to pay for a better night's sleep? Many would say no. **********The smaller trader's put on 100 Disney shares cost $160, including a one-way commission. That equals 2.9 percent of the amount protected, $5,500. But at the time of the purchase, the option had just 29 days left before expiration. Thus the annualized cost is 36.5 percent - expensive insurance. **********For larger players, with 1,000 Disney shares, the percentages are only slightly better. Commissions count for less; a discount broker might trade 10 put options for the same $35 minimum as one. Ten contracts would cost $1,285, including the broker's charge, which on an annualized basis equals 29.4 percent of the $55,000 protection. **********Carrying less insurance lowers the cost, of course. A February 50 put, with Disney at $56, cost 38 cents on Jan. 23. But for the 100-share trader, that represented an annualized cost of about 9.6 percent before commission, 18.4 percent with a one-way broker's fee. For the investor hedging 1,000 Disney shares, the cost equaled 10.4 percent annualized, including commission. This strategy would begin to soften losses only after Disney dropped below $50, a decline of 10.7 percent. Giving up even 9 percent (annualized) for this kind of protection makes little sense to many professional investors. Over a long period, equity markets appreciate at only about 9 percent annually, noted Thomas S. Mitchell, a general partner at Weiss, Peck & Greer. ''You've constructed a strategy where you can't make money over the long term,'' he said. **********Beating those odds requires an investor to buy insurance only occasionally, correctly picking market turns, the way a driver might buy auto insurance only if he expects an accident soon. A Boston broker likened them more to conventional short-swing scalping than to insurance. Said a Midwestern money manager, ''It's a hell of a good thing for brokers; it creates a lot of trading.'' **********Investors with large, diversified portfolios can employ the options on stock indexes, such as the S.&P. 500, the narrower S.&P. 100, or the broad Value Line Index. Sometimes the insurance can be cheaper. Al Frank, who edits the Prudent Speculator newsletter and manages about $60 million, decided in mid-January that the market was vulnerable and bought February S.&P. 100 puts at $75 per contract. He thus hedged a personal portfolio of $1.7 million at a cost of $5,250, plus commissions. **********On an annualized basis, the outlay worked out to about 4.1 percent before commission - paltry compared to the returns Mr. Frank has been generating. The puts looked so cheap, in fact, that Mr. Frank bought twice as many contracts as he needed for insurance. Two weeks later, the market had soared and the options had lost more than half their value. By last week they had lost more than 90 percent of their value. Said Mr. Frank of portfolio insurance: ''It's more difficult to manage than it sounds.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/06/world/the-un-today-aug-6-1987.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, planned to give a major address Thursday, as arms negotiators from the two sides meet in Geneva. **********Yuli M. Vorontsov, the new chief Soviet negotiator, and Max M. Kampelman, the American negotiator, are expected to meet privately on Thursday as a prelude to the next round of talks. **********Soviet officials have said that Soviet negotiators will be prepared to negotiate seriously on what research is allowed under the ABM treaty, a major issue in the talks. But Soviet officials also have said that they still oppose the Reagan Administration's position that extensive testing of space-based systems is permitted. **********''It is our position there should be no testing in space within the framework of S.D.I. because it is contrary to the antiballistic missile treaty,'' Yuri V. Dubinin, the Soviet Ambassador to Washington, said at a news conference today. S.D.I. is President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as ''Star Wars.'' Some Noteworthy Shifts **********Mr. Gorbachev's speech will come on the anniversary of his proposal to eliminate all nuclear weapons by the year 2000. That proposal was generally regarded as propagandistic in tone by American officials. **********But tucked in among the utopian proposals in Mr. Gorbachev's speech last year were some noteworty shifts in some Soviet negotiating positions. For example, the speech signaled the abandonment of the earlier Soviet demand that British and French forces be reduced along with American missiles as part of an ''interim'' ageement on medium-range arms. **********Some senior Administration have said that Mr. Gorbachev might offer some sweeping new proposals, but have questioned their potential significance. **********''We will probably hear several Soviet public declarations about 'new' intiatives but witness little, if any, real movement,'' Edward L. Rowny, an arms control adviser to President Reagan, said Tuesday. New Moves Expected Later **********Mr. Rowny speculated that the Russians would wait until later in the year to make important new moves. The Soviet Union would do so, he said, to provide time for assessing what action the new Congress takes on arms control issues and on the military budget. Mr. Rowny also speculated that the Russians would delay any new moves out of a belief that the Reagan Administration would be more eager to compromise as the Administration's time in office runs out. **********Soviet officials have previously suggested that the Soviet Union might alter its demand that the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty be interpreted in a very strict way that would confine research on space-based defensive systems to the laboratory. But the Russians have never introduced more flexible proposals on this issue in the formal negotiations. **********Administration officials have said that United States has not changed its basic negotiating position. The Administration has proposed a very loose interpretation of the treaty, which would allow extensive testing and development of space-based defensive systems. The Administration's interpretation of the treaty has been disputed by most of the original American negotiators of the agreement. Question Before White House **********One undecided question that is before the White House is whether to lift the Administration's proposed ban on long-range mobile missiles. **********Over the last year, the United States has yielded the tactical initiative to the Russians in the Geneva arms talks. **********The reactive American approach, in part, reflects the difficulties that the Administration has had in working out its internal disagreements on arms control issues, according to Administration officials. **********It also reflects the view of current officials that past Administrations have been too eager to suggest compromises on difficult issues. ''You don't want to operate on the assumption that every time you come back to the table, somehow we must be the ones who are going to be making the moves in order to resolve the differences,'' Mr. Kampelman told reporters before he left for Geneva. Other Issues in Other Forums **********The Geneva talks deal with measures on defensive systems and on ways to reduce long-range arms and medium-range weapons. **********But the two sides have discussed other arms issues in other forums. **********Administration officials told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that the United States had proposed that the two sides continue discussions on ways to improve the monitoring of two treaties that limit the size of underground tests. The Soviet Union has stressed the importance of stopping all tests. **********Today, the two sides also met in Geneva for private talks on the establishment of nuclear ''risk reduction centers'' in Washington and Moscow that would exchange information in order to reduce the risk of accidential nuclear war. **********Richard N. Perle, an assistant Defense Secretary, and Col. Robert B. Linhard of the National Security Council, represented the United States. The Soviet Union was represented by Aleksei A.

But the Reagan Administration has objected even to the comparatively mild Finance Committee bill, so it is not clear if such a compromise would be acceptable to the President. The Senate is expected to consider the bill in June. **********Comprehensive trade legislation has become one of the top priorities in the House and the Senate this year, and many Democrats hope it will be an important issue in the 1988 Presidential campaign. **********Many members of the House and the Senate who are worried about protectionism are pushing for a moderate bill that has a chance of being signed by the President. But others argue that the legislation needs to be tougher to send a meaningful signal to the nation's trading partners and have any chance of reducing the record $170 billion trade deficit. **********The Finance Committee bill does not include the amendment proposed by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri. That amendment requires trading partners, like Japan, to reduce their trade surpluses with the United States according to a rigid formula if they persist in closing their markets to American goods. That amendment was narrowly approved in the House on a vote of 218 to 214. Not Offered in Committee **********Senate supporters of this proposal did not offer it in committee today, and they acknowledge that winning approval of it in the full Senate would be difficult. In addition, the Administration has indicated that the President would veto any trade bill with the Gephardt amendment in it. **********Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said he did not offer the amendment to the committee because it would have been defeated. He said the amendment would be the ''ultimate test'' of the effectiveness of the trade bill and he wanted to work on a compromise to offer on the Senate floor. **********Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, agreed that there is a consensus that something must be done about countries that have attained large trade surpluses primarily from shutting out American products. But, he added: ''I want a trade bill that can become law. I'm not looking for a political issue.'' **********He contended that the Finance Committee bill would have enough support to pass and enough to override a Presidential veto. **********Before final approval today, the committee passed a Bentsen amendment that requires the President to propose measures to reduce reliance on imported oil when imports exceed 50 percent of consumption. The proposal would allow imposition of an oil import fee, new tax breaks for the oil industry and conservation measures. **********Another amendment adopted would limit lamb imports to help American producers. Similarities to House Bill **********The Senate bill includes many provisions that are also in the House bill. Among them are an extension and broadening of trade adjustment assistance to workers and companies injured by imports. The bill also designates as an unfair trade practice the denial by other countries of workers' rights, such as the right to form unions. **********The major difference between the two bills is in retaliatory provisions. Both require some retaliation, but the House bill goes much further. **********Under the Senate proposal, the Administration is required each year to initiate actions against unfair trade practices that close markets to American products. **********If the practices violate trade agreements, the President must retaliate within 19 months if there is no agreement with the country or there is no settlement of the dispute by a panel set up under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The specific retaliation, which the President can choose, must equal the dollar value of American trade lost. Exceptions Granted **********There are four exceptions under which the President can avoid retaliation: a GATT ruling that the United States' position is wrong; a settlement agreeable to the industry involved; an agreement by the foreign country to allow in enough other products to offset the trade loss, and a Presidential ruling that retaliation would harm national security. **********For lesser unfair trade practices, the retaliation is not mandatory and there are broader exceptions. **********In the House-approved bill, there are similar provisions for product-by-product or industry-by-industry retaliation. But there is no automatic initiation of the cases, and the exceptions are broader. **********The House bill, however, has provisions that require retaliation against countries, like Japan, that have built up large trade surpluses with the United States partly by shutting out American products. Quotas or Fees **********Under the House bill, if negotiations to eliminate the trade barriers fail, the Administration is required to impose quotas or fees equal to the trade lost. Then the Gephardt amendment requires that if the country persists in the unfair trade practices, actions be taken to reduce the country's trade surplus with the United States by 10 percent a year. **********The Administration can do this by banning imports or canceling trade agreements. Or the country can reduce the surplus by importing more American products or exporting less. **********These provisions will be at the heart of the eventual negotiations between the House and the Senate on a final bill. Many members of the Senate think both provisions are protectionist and will result in retaliation against the United States. **********The Senate bill also requires that the Administration submit a comprehensive trade policy statement to Congress. When it does, the procedure for quick approval of trade agreements will be extended. That procedure expires in January 1988. Trade negotiatiors contend that the procedure is necessary for negotiations because without it other countries have no assurance that a trade agreement will be ratified."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/01/business/talking-deals-the-liquor-consolidations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 828, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Deals; The Liquor Consolidations", "print_headline": "Talking Deals; The Liquor Consolidations", "body_text": " **********FACED with declining worldwide liquor consumption, the international liquor industry is turning to consolidation as a way to prop up sagging sales. Indeed, analysts say that by the end of the decade the industry, traditionally the domain of small, independent operators, will consist of a handful of conglomerates. **********The decline in consumption, estimated to be at least 2 percent a year, has propelled the industry into a flurry of deals - both takeovers and mergers - intended to give liquor companies complete control of their products, from the distillery to the shelf. **********The deals can take many shapes. In some cases the distiller of one brand might buy another, or move closer to the consumer and acquire a distributor that has profitable market penetration. **********Britain's Guinness P.L.C., for example, entered into a joint marketing agreement in June with Moet-Hennessy, a French company that in 1980 had acquired its own distributor, Schiefflin & Company. Then last month Guinness purchased its United States importer, Schenley Industries. Guinness has also entered into a joint operating agreement with the Bacardi group in Spain. **********Guinness's chief executive, Anthony Tennant, had a similar strategy when he was head of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C.'s subsidiary, International Distillers and Vintners. In 1980 Grand Metropolitan acquired Liggett Group Inc., the American distributor of Grand Metropolitan's J & B Scotch. **********More recently Grand Metropolitan has continued its expansion. In January it acquired Heublein Inc., the American marketer of almost 100 brands of spirits, wines and beers in the United States, including Grand Met's Black Velvet whisky. And in July it forged an international drinks distribution network with Martell, the French cognac maker. **********The motives for these deals vary. In many cases the company being acquired not only can add to the balance sheet, but also can provide funds to promote slower sellers. Beyond that, however, there is the question of trying to grab a bigger piece of a smaller pie. **********''If you don't go out there, the best distributor will belong to a competitor,'' said Fiona Mathieson, an industry analyst with Wood Mackenzie. ''By controlling brand and product rights through the point of sale, your own management skills are at test. You are effectively wiping out the competition.'' In addition, said Frank Walters, the director of research at Impact, a spirits industry newsletter, building new brands can be costly. ''It's a lot more economical to buy a brand,'' he said. ''The one-brand company is going to find it very hard to compete.'' **********With its longstanding base of production in Britain and its centuries-old access to overseas markets, the British spirits industry has pioneered the consolidation. The more recent mergers focus on the United States and Southeast Asia, where the market for imports has expanded in recent years. For example, while sales of domestic vodkas have declined since 1980 in the United States, sales of imported vodkas have soared. **********Analysts say that with United States consumption of liquor estimated to have peaked in 1984, it is only a matter of time before the American liquor industry completes its consolidation. ''U.S. companies have had such a big market for so many years,'' said Michelle Proud, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, ''That they haven't had to look abroad.'' **********The Bacardi group, a loosely bound conglomerate of 13 distillers and distributors, and the producer of the world's best-selling liquor, Bacardi rum, has been especially courted in recent years. The 125-year-old Cuban company anticipated current trends toward consolidation decades ago, so by the time Fidel Castro nationalized the Cuban liquor industry in 1959, Bacardi had already built a production and distribution network in the United States and Puerto Rico. The group, which is still largely owned by descendants of the Bacardi family, has always resisted joint ventures, but there are signs, such as the agreement with Guinness, that Bacardi is finally looking for a partner. **********''Bacardi, like everyone else, is under pressure to enter distribution agreements,'' Ms. Proud said. Nonetheless, the group recently rebuffed overtures by Allied-Lyons P.L.C., one of Britain's largest pub owners and brewers, and the owner of Hiram Walker Resources, the North American spirits giant. At the time of Hiram Walker's sale to Allied-Lyons last year Hiram Walker owned 13 percent of the Bacardi group. Bacardi bought back the stake last month. **********In the current environment, Ms. Mathieson said, Bacardi's multinational licensing, bottling and distribution network puts the company in an extremely favorable bargaining position. Analysts say that a major deal with the Bacardi group would effectively close the door on any significant entries into the international spirits industry."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/14/business/more-settlements-awaited-in-power-system-s-default-case.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 793, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "More Settlements Awaited in Power System's Default Case", "print_headline": "More Settlements Awaited in Power System's Default Case", "body_text": " **********The $92 million settlement announced last week against one set of defendants in the Washington Public Power Supply System's bond default case is seen as a pattern for settlements with other groups of defendants. **********''Over all, we're looking for a very significant recovery in the case,'' said Paul M. Bernstein, chief counsel for the bondholders. He helped negotiate the settlement with the bond underwriters. **********In the settlement, the lead underwriters of the bonds - Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers, Smith Barney and Prudential-Bache - agreed to pay $80 million plus $12 million interest for 18 months. **********The underwriters were among defendants named in a class-action lawsuit by holders of $2.25 billion of the power system's bonds. The bonds went into default in July 1983 after construction was halted on two nuclear plants - one near Richland, Wash., and one west of Olympia, Wash. - with each of the plants less than 25 percent complete. Pressure on Others Seen **********Trial of the suit in Federal District Court is a year away. Lawyers say settlement pressure is mounting on the remaining defendants, which include the architects and engineers of the abandoned plants, the attorneys and financial advisers to the supply system and bond-rating agencies. **********The lawsuit has been combined with one filed by the Chemical Bank, the bondholder trustee, which names the supply system, the Bonneville Power Administration and the 88 utilities in the Northwest that were involved in the nuclear project. **********William Berls, Chemical's vice president for trusts and investments, said in a telephone interview, ''We think it is encouraging to see a settlement in the morass of litigation.'' But he declined to speculate on whether similar deals might follow, citing an order from Federal District Judge William Browning that forbids discussing details of negotiations. **********But James Curtis, Bonneville's deputy financial manager, declared, ''As a practical matter, this is the first initiative and will make settlement seem a more realistic outcome to other defendants.'' Projections of Outcome **********Analysts have long considered that a sweeping settlement by all parties might net the bondholders between $225 million, or 10 cents on the dollar, and $1 billion. Already $106 million of settlement funds is held in escrow by Chemical. This is in addition to the undewrwriters' $92 million settlement last week. **********Analysts view the settlement as a important step toward clearing the way for the supply system to refinance $6.1 billion in outstanding bonds for its three remaining nuclear plants. **********Some $2.6 billion of these bonds still bear interest rates between 11 percent and 15 percent - well above today's market rates for similar bonds - and they represent the largest block of tax-exempt municipal bonds that have not been refinanced. But the supply system has been denied access to the bond market since the default. Analysts believe access could be regained within the next year or two, once the litigation is resolved. Tax Corrections Sought **********The Northwest is now paving the way for refinancing by pushing for Congressional corrections in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Gary Petersen, a supply system lobbyist, said: ''There's tremendous support throughout the Northwest from utility associations for refunding because rate payers could save up to $130 million annually if interest rates dropped to 9 percent. This infers that the region wants settlements.'' **********Gary Lundgren, vice president of Marshall & Meyer Inc., a Seattle-based bond house, believes underwriters were major players in the lawsuit and ''settled too cheap, for nickels on the dollar, which is good for underwriters, not bondholders.'' He added, ''The 'deep pockets' now will be Bonneville, the 88 utilities and remaining defendants.'' **********But suggestions that the underwriters did not pay enough were termed ''crazy'' by Mr. Bernstein, the bondholders' lawyer. ''It was an excellent settlement,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We believe they were less culpable than other defendants.'' Viewpoint of the Utilities **********But whether all groups of defendants will go along with the underwriters' action remains to be seen. **********Al Malanca, the lawyer for about half of the utilities, threatens to go to trial rather than have consumers finance a settlement through rate increases. The utilities insist they are not liable because the Supreme Court of Washington State ruled that utilities did not need to repay revenue bonds on nuclear plants that would never be completed. **********''Somebody is going to have to crawl over my dead body before my clients will have to raise their rates,'' said Mr. Malanca."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/09/business/dow-falls-by-1626-to-254512.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Demaria", "pub_date": "1987-09-09", "snippet": "LEAD: The major stock market pullback that started two weeks ago continued yesterday, but a late rally turned a rout into a modest loss.

It later steadied after heavy intervention by foreign central banks. A volatile dollar discourages foreign investors, who are loath to risk money in the American stock market, knowing that any gains they make might be wiped out in currency translation.

Grennan, at Shearson Lehman Brothers. ''I expect a reflex knee-jerk type of rally. On a short-term basis, we're oversold.''

The repurchase was to be financed by the sale of Gencorp's tire business as well as its soft-drink bottling unit and the broadcast operations of its RKO General subsidiary. **********The sale of the units would leave Gencorp with Aerojet General, a maker of aerospace and defense products, and Diversitech General, a manufacturer of plastic and industrial products.

He didn't have to tell his audience that the conglomerates are giants composed of differently named chains or that the networks are single agencies with many far-flung offices.

His point was that the advertising of most global products requires local solutions. **********Mr. Scott got to that point in his speech after a first-rate job of explaining the progress of the British agency from a fiefdom subservient to American interests to a booming business that has shaken off its shackles and is buying United States companies left and right. **********As the American colonists rebelled against the absentee management of the British crown, so the British agency business has rebelled against the absentee management of American international agencies, Mr. Scott said. **********And with the help of a far healthier economy brought about by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the British advertising community has almost flipped the percentage of billings at the top 20 agencies in Britain from 70 percent in the hands of American agencies to only 40 percent. **********At the same time, Mr. Scott maintained, there has been a return of creative advertising in the British tradition that was all but stamped out by the introduction of on-site American managers and their promulgation of research-dominated creativity. **********Came the revolution, and ''the British advertising industry once again came to believe that advertising could be effective without being insipid,'' he said, adding, ''It remembered that advertising could entice, charm, amuse and flatter the consumer and still be effective.'' **********The management of Mr. Scott's agency, begun in 1979 as Wight Collins Rutherford Scott, realized a few years later that because of British tax laws it had the choice of selling out and giving up ''the identity, independence and entrepreneurial drive that had been snuffed out like a flame in so many good and occasionally great British agencies, or fighting to retain the values and culture that had made the business a success,'' Mr. Scott said.

Some say they will try to go back to Mexico if conditions in Guatemala do not improve. **********Guatemalan Indians flooded into Mexico after a coup in March 1982 that installed Gen. Efrain Rios Montt as President. In that period, many thousands of Indians were killed as soldiers swept through the western highlands in search of guerrillas. At least 100 villages were destroyed, and many more were abandoned, according to diplomats and other foreigners. **********The new civilian president, Marco Vinicio Cerezo, has told local officials to help resettle refugees who return.

She said the Government would help them go back to Mexico if no other solution was possible. **********According to foreigners who have recently visited Huehuetenango, 49 Indians who returned to the village of Nubila in January have been made to perform manual labor and to take part in nightly civil patrols, and they have not been able to reclaim their farmland.

''I've always thought we would be much better off if we had never heard of a water sale.'' **********When Aurora went water-shopping at the end of 1986, it bought the rights from 300 sources, primarily farmers, increasing its water supply by 30 percent. The total price of $50 million was financed through a bond issue. **********The sale of water rights, which allow the owners to take the specified amount of water for their use, was once regarded as unthinkable. But it is becoming increasingly common across the arid West. The demand for water in urban areas is outpacing supplies in mountain rivers and reservoirs while farming, which experts estimate has consumed more than 80 percent of the West's water, is in a crisis. **********Water marketing meets with political approval from both conservatives and liberals and thus may represent part of a permanent change in the West's way of life. **********In the last few years a heated debate has developed, with proponents of selling water contending that a free market will bring more efficient distribution of an often-subsidized, often-squandered resource. But others say water sales are draining the life from many small communities and may cause irreparable damage. **********''What this does to a community shouldn't be done to a dog,'' said Frank Milenski, a retired farmer from La Junta, Colo., where sales of water rights are causing steep declines in land values, reducing property-tax income and drying up sales in farm-related businesses. **********''This is my home and the home for a lot of people,'' said Mr. Milenski. ''If a man wants to sell his water rights, that's his business. But it shouldn't ruin the rest of the community.'' **********Similar concerns can be found across much of the West. In Arizona, farmers are upset because booming towns near Phoenix are buying entire ranches just for their water. ''For the farmers left, this is very much a threat to their own water supply,'' said Deborah Flowers, the director of information for the Arizona Farm Bureau. Restrictions Are Adopted **********California Farm Bureau members voted in December to support a number of restrictions on sales and transfers. ''There are some potential problems that need to be nipped in the bud,'' said Jim Eller, the group's legislative director in Sacramento. ''A grower just can't arbitrarily sell his water if it's going to affect others.'' **********The issue has emerged in response to two large regional forces: waning Federal interest in financing huge water projects, and the continued strong growth of metropolitan regions. **********''Almost universally, the cities are turning to agriculture,'' said John A. Folk-Williams, the president of Western Network, a New Mexico research group specializing in natural resource issues. ''That's because agriculture accounts for 80 to 90 percent of the water used in most Western states and a lot of it is used to produce low-value crops, such as alfalfa and pasture.'' **********''Something has to give,'' said Dick Gardner, an economist with the budget office of Gov. Cecil Andrus of Idaho. ''As long as there's water available for urban growth and new industry, that's fine. But today, the rivers of the West are generally fully appropriated.'' Anxiety About Big Dams **********The concept of water marketing enjoys considerable and broad political support across the West. Conservatives like it because it reduces the Federal role in water development. Liberals are drawn to it because more efficient exchanges of water could reduce the need for large, environmentally destructive dams. **********Traditionally, farmers and ranchers have been among those most opposed to the water sales. But even that has started to change as the farm economy has worsened. **********''Farmers are sitting there with something marketable,'' said Bill Milenski, Frank's son, who is a loan officer with the Rocky Ford National Bank in Rocky Ford, Colo. ''To keep the wolves away from their door, farmers are selling the best producing asset they have.'' **********For some farmers, the sale of water rights is a last desperate act to save the farm. But in the Arkansas Valley, home of some of the nation's richest melon fields, the sale of water rights is the equivalant of agricultural suicide. **********''Water is everything here,'' said Mr. Carter. ''The land is not hardly worth anything without water. You can't produce much of anything without irrigation.'' He Will Live on the Interest **********A rugged, wind-bronzed Colorado farmer, Mr. Carter said he sold his water rights not out of financial hardship, but because it made good business sense. **********Of the roughly $400,000 he got from the town of Aurora in December, he said: ''I can take that money, put it in the bank and draw interest and make a lot more money that I could farming. Besides, I'm 68 years old and I could stand a little fishing, too.'' His fertile land, which once sprouted melons, beets, alfalfa, corn and other crops, will now be left to bake and crack in the summer heat. **********The price Mr. Carter received, $1,500 for each acre-foot of water a year, was a good one, although not spectacular. Prices for water rights in the West typically range from less than $100 to $2,000 for an acre-foot, the amount of water that would cover a level acre to the depth of one foot. But in some cases, rights have sold for up to $10,000 an acre-foot. **********The price ''really varies depending on how water-tight a region is,'' said Jo Clark, the director of programs for the Western Governors Association. An acre-foot, roughly, will supply the needs of a family of four for a year. A Big Portion Has Been Sold **********Today, the water rights to 60,000 acres of the 320,000 acres of irrigated land in the Arkansas River Valley have been sold, said Frank Milenski. Without water, the land's value drops from $700 or $1,000 an acre to less than $100, he said. **********The environmental impact could also be severe, he said. ''If the ground isn't protected properly and the wind starts blowing, you could see giant duststorms like we had in the 30's, and that would be totally devastating,'' Mr. Milenski said. **********The Western Governors Association said in a report last summer that the detrimental effects of water sales could be reduced if farmers leased their water rights, instead of selling them permanently as around Ordway, or if they sold only a part of them. ''Agriculture currently has the rights to about 85 percent of the water in the West,'' the report said. ''If farmers yielded only 10 percent of this, it would provide enough water to meet urban demands in most areas into the 20th century.'' **********But in the Arkansas River Valley, cities are frequently purchasing 100 percent of a farmer's rights, which could someday bring back the desert. **********''There is no way to compensate these people for the long-term effects on their community,'' said Mr. Folk-Williams. ''And when the water is taken away, what's left to attract new industry? Nobody has answered that question yet.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/30/business/company-briefs-712287.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 232, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Bethlehem Steel Corp, Bethlehem, Pa., said its directors had voted to omit second-quarter dividends on its common stock and two classes of preferred stock. *********** Emery Air Freight Corp., Wilton, Conn., said it had purchased about 83 percent of Purolator Courier Corp.'s common stock, the maximum number of shares tendered for in its previously announced offer. *********** Home Shopping Network Inc., Clearwater, Fla., said it would begin in September to offer broadcasters and cable television operators a plan under which the operators would receive a 5 percent sales commission by broadcasting Home Shopping Network during the night when their stations are not otherwise operating. *********** Humana Inc., Louisville, Ky., which runs hospitals and primary care centers, said it had terminated talks on the acquisition of International Medical Centers Inc. from Recarey Enterprises because it could not reach an agreement on terms. *********** Resource Exploration Inc., Akron, Ohio, said it had agreed in principle to acquire all of the oil and gas assets and operations of Shongum Corp., Livingston, N.J., for $2,34 million cash. *********** TRW Inc., Cleveland, a maker of original-equipment and replacement car and truck products, said shareholders had approved a 2-for-1 stock split and an increase in the number of authorized common shares to 250 million, from 125 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/20/business/business-people-i-magnin-chief-leaving-to-join-a-new-company.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 410, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.

While officials concede that slashing the farm aid is a formidable task, they maintained that they had taken a critical, and difficult, first step. 'The Urgency of the Problem' **********''A few years ago it would have been impossible to have agreed on an issue as controversial as farm policy,'' said Frans Andriessen, agricultural commissioner for the European Community. ''Our agreement says something about the urgency of the problem worldwide.'' **********While agricultural trade barriers are already a subject of trade talks, this accord increases the scope of negotiations by asserting that farm subsidies are a form of protectionism that should be limited. Reducing agricultural subsidies would almost certainly produce sweeping changes for farmers around the world. **********In another section, the communique, which also focused on efforts to stabilize the dollar and end trade imbalances, stated that West Germany would adjust its growth strategy if a ''serious risk'' to sustained expansion of domestic demand developed. A Commitment by Bonn **********American and European officials who have long called on Bonn to stimulate domestic demand praised the commitment. West Germany, which reported weak economic growth in the first quarter, said it would examine its growth statistics in June to determine whether its economy is in need of stimulation, a condition that German officials said would be reached if the growth rate were below 2 percent. **********Several ministers said the stimulation could take the form of an interest rate cut or an accelerated tax cut.

''Economic actions need time to bear fruit.'' A Shift in Stances **********For years, the Americans have struggled to put the issue of rapidly rising farm subsidies on the international agenda. American officials said they were delighted that the stalemate had been broken at this O.E.C.D. meeting as two strong advocates of subsidy programs, West Germany and Japan, shifted their stances and decided to support a broadly worded communique that calls for market forces to play a larger role in determining farm production and prices. **********''This is not just a financial and economic question, it's a social and political question in every country,'' Mr. Baker said. ''It's only when we move on a multilateral basis that any country, including the United States, will find the political will to deal with this problem.'' **********Ministers said the breakthrough agreement lays the groundwork for discussions of agricultural policy at the economic summit meeting in Venice June 8-10. **********''This is all about building political support around a bunch of principles,'' one senior United States trade official said. **********Agricultural experts said the hardest work would be to negotiate a detailed trade agreement - as part of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -that would limit both agricultural subsidies and protectionist measures against farm imports. A Comparison by Baker **********''It will be a difficult process, just like dealing with third world debt,'' Mr. Baker said.

Indeed, a German official vowed that his country would never agree to a cut in farm prices. To win German backing, the communique was worded to say that governments would have flexibility in the ways they reduce support to their farmers, with each tailoring its approach to meet its needs. **********One provision in the communique aims to limit overproduction by stating that ''farm income support should, as appropriate, be sought through direct income support'' rather than by providing price guarantees or other supports that encourage farmers to grow more. **********''The key issue was how to reduce surplus production,'' said Martin Bangemann, West Germany's Minister of Economics and president of the O.E.C.D. meeting.

Gorbachev, Soviet and American officials indicated today that reductions of strategic nuclear weapons and a Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan had emerged as the two areas holding the greatest opportunities for progress at the summit talks. **********Both sides cautioned that serious disagreements remained in both fields, as well as in other areas to be discussed, including human rights and the war in the Persian Gulf, during the Soviet leader's five sessions with President Reagan. But as the officials sketched their nations' positions, they highlighted new points of flexibility and stressed their determination to concentrate on what is negotiable rather than on the impasses that have prevented progress in the past. **********In interviews broadcast on television today, Max M. Kampelman, the chief United States arms negotiator, said he thought it would be possible to conclude, by next March or April, a treaty on major reductions of long-range weapons, the most menacing in the Soviet and American arsenals. Secretary of State George P. Shultz hinted at flexibility in a key area of discord -setting certain subordinate limits on various categories of such weapons. **********Yevgeny P. Velikhov, a senior Soviet arms control adviser, implied that Mr. Gorbachev would be bringing some new ideas on verifying compliance with a limit on sea-based cruise missiles. And Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said a withdrawal from Afghanistan ''will be very high on the agenda when General Secretary Gorbachev comes to the city.'' A Mosaic of Hopefulness **********The officials tried to observe the usual custom of lowering expectations before a summit meeting to avoid laying the groundwork for disappointment. But their various remarks created a mosaic of hopefulness nonetheless, suggesting that both sides were poised to seize this round of meetings as a critical opportunity to narrow some important differences. **********Mr. Gorbachev is scheduled to arrive at 4:40 P.M. Monday at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland, where Mr. Shultz is to meet him. The Soviet leader has no meetings scheduled until the formal arrival ceremony at the White House Tuesday morning, although American arms negotiators are reportedly eager to begin talks with their Soviet counterparts Monday night, if the Russians agree. **********On Tuesday, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev are to sign a treaty eliminating their countries' missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles, an agreement that addresses a side issue in the nuclear arms race but is the first accord between the superpowers to ban an entire class of weapons. **********A Soviet official with the delegation in Washington said today that some last-minute demands by the Americans on verification procedures had led the Russians to consider calling off the summit meeting two days ago. The report could not be confirmed, however, and Mr. Shultz said today that the treaty was entirely complete now and that the text was being put ''onto a special kind of paper that treaties are inscribed on.'' Beyond the Missile Treaty **********Beyond that, the two leaders seem eager to progress toward their stated goal of substantially reducing long-range nuclear weapons, down to 6,000 warheads on each side. Further, Mr. Shultz said today on the ABC News program ''This Week'' that ''we should work on a conventional arms reduction, also chemical weapons.'' **********It will be Mr. Gorbachev's first visit to the United States, and Administration officials have expressed disappointment that his three days here will be confined to a few blocks of Washington, without the opportunity to travel and absorb something of the country. Most of his time will be taken up with high-level meetings, although he has invited groups of American publishers and businessmen to meet with him at various sessions in the Soviet Embassy, five blocks from the White House. **********Nevertheless, American officials see the high priority assigned to working meetings as a good sign, and they have been encouraged by recent Soviet statements of flexibility on strategic arms and Afghanistan. **********Since last September, the Russians have signaled a shift of tactics on ''Star Wars,'' Mr. Reagan's plan for a space-based missile defense. Having tried and failed at the previous two summit meetings to get the President to abandon the plan, Mr. Gorbachev has evidently dropped the attempt at head-on confrontation. He appears intent on doing the possible - negotiating the arms reductions and trying to agree on a period in which both sides would pledge to observe the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Period Negotiable, Russian Says **********Moscow insists that the treaty prohibits most tests of anti-missile weapons in space, while the Administration insists that it permits them. Rather than trying to resolve this difference now, Mr. Gerasimov and other Soviet officials are saying, the emphasis should be on an agreed period of ''nonwithdrawal'' from the ABM treaty. **********The United States has proposed 7 years, and the Soviet Union has proposed 10. But Col. Gen. Nikolai F. Chervov, the head of the arms control directorate of the Soviet General staff, said in an interview that the time period was negotiable. ''It could be 10 years or 15 or less,'' he said. The possibility seems to exist for agreement on this at the summit. **********But Mr. Gerasimov stressed today that ultimately, the ''Star Wars'' issue would have to be faced. ''Star Wars is the problem,'' he said on ''This Week.'' ''It is - or 'will be' may be the correct way to put it - will be the problem in the future.'' **********''I don't care about this S.D.I. as such,'' he said, referring to the official name of the program, the Strategic Defense Initiative. ''What we do care is that during this technological research you can find some new offensive purpose.'' Afghan and Rights Issues **********On Afghanistan, American officials said there had been signs of Soviet willingness to set a 12-month withdrawal timetable regardless of whether the Afghan guerrillas agree with the Communists on the composition of an interim government in Kabul. **********The human rights issue looms as a major one in the talks. Mr. Shultz, discussing the lack of trust between the two powers, said: ''It comes from the fact that in the Soviet Union they don't treat human beings in the way we think they ought to and in the way that they agreed to in the Helsinki Final Act and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.'' **********He added: ''The real tensions are not caused by these armaments. They're caused by the human rights problems, by the aggressive behavior.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/11/business/business-technology-advances-in-film-low-budget-movies-get-a-high-gloss.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1987-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 890, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Low-Budget Movies Get A High Gloss", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY: ADVANCES IN FILM; Low-Budget Movies Get A High Gloss", "body_text": " **********The American public's appetite for feature films is growing rapidly, in large part because of the phenomenal popularity of video cassettes. The cost of making those feature films, though, is rising even more rapidly. In 1985, the last year for which figures are available, the average production cost of a feature film was $16.8 million, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. **********Yet to feed the demand for movies and video cassettes - even those whose highest aspiration is to splatter across a drive-in movie screen for a few steamy summer weekends -the movie industry needs a constant supply of new film makers and story tellers, to whom a $16.8 million budget is more unbelievable than ''Vampire Penguins From Mars.'' **********Many independent film makers break into the business by shooting low-budget movies - low budget, these days, meaning a million or two - and hoping for a big box office score. Low budget does not necessarily mean low quality; ''She's Gotta Have It,'' ''My Dinner With Andre,'' ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ''Mother Teresa'' have something in common: Each was shot on a low budget with 16-millimeter film that was then enlarged to 35 millimeter for theatrical release. **********Until recently, however, the ''grainy'' quality of the image on the movie screen was a dead giveaway that the film was shot in 16 millimeter. ''When people think of 16 mm. they have the idea of this cheap, grainy, black and white garbage,'' said Dan Diefenderfer, president of the Shriek Company, an independent film studio in Kansas City, Mo. ''Well, those days are over for good.'' **********Sixteen millimeter has an important role in the film industry, but most directors are still going to shoot their feature films and commercials in 35 millimeter, said Irwin Young, chairman of DuArt Film Laboratories Inc. of New York. ''There's a magic to 35,'' he said. ''There's a lot more you can do with the film.'' **********But recent advances in color film technology, camera optics and in the process of blowing up film to 35 millimeter from 16 are yielding film print quality that some experts say is hard to distinguish from the more expensive 35-millimeter originals. ''Now, the average layman would never be able to tell in the theater whether the film he was looking at was 16 or 35,'' said John Newell, president of Western Cine, a film laboratory in Denver. **********Part of the reason is an advanced emulsion technology developed by the Eastman Kodak Company. In conventional color photographic film, light images are captured by crystals of silver halide laid down with at least nine emulsion layers on an acetate base. The bigger the crystals and the thicker the emulsions, the more the light is scattered on the film, and thus the grainier and less sharp the image. **********Kodak developed a process to shape the silver halide crystals into tablets, or ''T-grains,'' which are flatter, thinner and have a larger surface, and are thus more efficient at gathering light. At the same time, the emulsions are applied in slightly thinner layers. As a result, said Edward J. Blasko of Kodak's Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products division, ''there is less light scattering, better light transmission and sharper film images.'' **********All the better to show slimy alien creatures gnawing on hapless humans in the dark, said Mr. Diefenderfer, whose first film, ''Timesweep,'' incorporates monsters, zombies, ghouls, copious amounts of gore and nubile maidens in great peril. ''The colors were beautiful, with a lot of contrast and great depth of field,'' he said. ''It picked up every single little detail. We were all blown away by how gorgeous it is.'' **********''I'll put the quality of this film -maybe not the content - up against anybody's 35 millimeter,'' he said. **********''Timesweep'' was shot in 16 millimeter, in 17 days and at a cost of $1.7 million. Filming in 35 would have added hundreds of thousands to the cost, Mr. Diefenderfer said. **********The original 16-millimeter color negative footage of ''Timesweep'' was taken to Mr. Newell's laboratory, where it was blown up to 35 millimeter using a process called full immersion step optical printing. The process, which uses a 35-millimeter camera with special optics to rephotograph 16-millimeter film that is submersed in solution in a sort of fishbowl, ''hides scratches and contracts the grain pattern, which gives the film greater acuity - it looks less grainy to the eye,'' Mr. Newell said. **********The Shriek Company will soon take ''Timesweep'' off to Hollywood to find a buyer. Even if the film fetches twice its production cost, it would represent a savings of many millions over a comparable studio-financed film. **********With his profits from ''Timesweep,'' Mr. Diefenderfer plans to make a more ambitious film (more zombies and more maidens in peril) using 35-millimeter film, which allows greater special effects and more panoramic vistas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/03/business/tourism-up-in-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1987-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tourism Up in Britain", "print_headline": "Tourism Up in Britain", "body_text": " **********Overseas tourists flocked to Britain in record numbers during the first half of 1987, the British Tourist Authority said today.

Baker 3d is striving to find a way to make the major industrial nations work together in their common interest - and, not incidentally, in the American interest as well. **********The clash between national interests and world economics will be inescapable when the top financial officials of the Group of Five - the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain and France - finally get together, possibly as early as next weekend, in an effort to quiet the uproar in the foreign exchange markets. **********There is irony to the ingrained pursuit of national interest in an increasingly integrated world economy. The Group of Five meeting itself, the latest in a series of such meetings, represents a forced recognition - forced by the inability of the five to control their own exchange rates and economies - that the unit for economic policy-making must be the world economy, not individual national economies, not even one so powerful as the United States. **********Mr. Baker, the chief economic officer of the United States, appears to have accepted this principle, having made the leap early in his tenure to the world economic viewpoint. That he has is abundantly evident in Mr. Baker's efforts to improve the United States economy by insisting that the German and Japanese Governments stimulate theirs so their peoples will buy more American goods and save the United States from its huge trade deficit. **********However, his strategy is not narrowly conceived to serve only American trade interests, Mr. Baker argues. ''We feel that we are engaged in a life-or-death struggle here to preserve the world economy,'' he said in defending the pressure that the United States is putting on Japan and West Germany to expand their economies more rapidly. Their concern is that this policy could breed inflation. Yet, slowly and painfully, the other countries appear to be coming around to the Baker view that, despite the risks to their own economies, international cooperation is crucial to their interests. **********A key element in the Baker strategy has been the dollar devaluation, which got a big boost at the famous Plaza Hotel meeting in New York on September 22, 1985. At that meeting, the Group of Five agreed to a concerted effort to lower the value of the dollar - largely by coordinating the downward movement of interest rates, a step that has nourished the financial markets. Indeed, the stock market has had one of its biggest booms in history. **********Last month, Mr. Baker and his team engineered a new burst of dollar devaluation, because the 40 percent decline up to Jan. 1 had failed to reduce the trade deficit noticeably. Largely against the wishes of America's industrial partners, the dollar this year has been pushed down 7.4 percent against the mark and 4.4 percent against the yen. **********In a state of alarm about the climbing yen, which he feared was inflicting damage on the Japanese economy, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa made an emergency trip to Washington two weeks ago, in an effort to persuade Mr. Baker to help stop the yen from rising further. And Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, accused the United States of ''playing with fire'' in talking the dollar down and the mark up. Both the Germans and Japanese bitterly resent being pushed around by the Americans. **********This holds as strongly in the area of trade as currencies. Last week, after the United States settled a dispute over grain exports with the European Community, with the Europeans yielding to an American threat of a 200 percent tariff, a European official said, ''We prefer this to a trade war; there would be no winners. But what's bad is that we made concessions. The community always ends up by accepting the will of the Americans.'' **********Despite such resentment of American pressure - or leadership -there are grounds for hope that the Reagan Administration will succeed in getting the other major industrial countries to go along with its exchange-rate, interest-rate, trade-expansion and global-growth strategy. **********The recent meeting in Washington between Secretary Baker and Finance Minister Miyazawa looks more and more like a victory for the United States. Japan appears to have gotten the message that America will let the market carry the dollar down if the Japanese do not take actions to step up the growth of their economy. Mr. Baker, on the other hand, is promising to help stabilize the dollar-yen relationship if Japan follows through on the stimulus that it promised at an earlier Baker-Miyazawa meeting, last Oct. 31. ASIDE benefit of Mr. Baker's hang-tough policy may yet come from the Germans. While still grumbling about not wanting to be a ''locomotive'' for the Americans, the German Bundesbank cut its two key interest rates even before last Sunday's election, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl was re-elected by a lower plurality than he expected. A poor showing by the right-wing nationalists increases the likelihood that the Germans will stop being so heavy-handed and even arrogant in their resistance to the American approach to economic growth. **********Secretary Baker is not going for quick, spectacular gains. Rather, he sees himself as pursuing something like Woody Hayes's football strategy at Ohio State - ''three yards and a cloud of dust.'' The Plaza agreement in September 1985 was the first three yards, followed last March by a Group of Five coordinated reduction in central bank rates. A month later, there was a second round of discount-rate cuts by the G-5 minus Germany, and in May at the Tokyo economic summit the G-7 (the G-5 plus Canada and Italy) agreed to closer policy coordination. Last September there was G-7 agreement on multilateral surveillance, and in October came the Baker-Miyazawa agreement. **********''These six steps,'' said Secretary Baker, ''are only a start. We need to build on them while keeping our expectations within reasonable bounds.'' The next Group of Five or Group of Seven meeting, expected early this month, is more likely to produce not some magnificent breakthrough, but another three yards and a cloud of dust. **********However, if the American push bogs down and a cooperative spirit is lacking among the major industrial nations, a crack-up still could come, with severe political as well as economic consequences for the world. It was the absence of that spirit that produced the Depression half a century ago. While history never repeats itself exactly, there are enough similarities to that earlier economic disaster to suggest that the gods of inflation, depression and nationalism are still haunting the world economy -and could dominate it if international cooperation is missing. **********The dangers to the increasingly integrated world economy stem from several sources. One threat is that the United States dollar, the world's key currency will go into a free fall. Fears of a collapsing dollar could cause capital flight from the United States, resulting in a lack of funds to finance the Federal budget deficit, the trade deficit and private investment. That, in turn, would mean climbing interest rates and a plummeting economy and stock market. Or, if the Federal Reserve sought to escape from the problem by, in effect, simply creating more money to replace the departing foreign capital, its action could bring on inflation that would further undermine the national currency. **********Another danger is that the wide imbalances in trade - America's $175 billion deficit last year and trade surpluses of $80 and $50 billion, respectively, for Japan and Germany - will set off a wave of protectionism and competitive devaluations. The resulting threats to national industries and to the jobs and incomes of workers and farmers could make nations adopt policies of autarky, or self-sufficiency, walling themselves off from foreign competition and capital flows in the hope of achieving economic survival. The last time this solution was tried, the fall in world trade only aggravated the Depression. **********And if world trade should founder, the poor countries of the Third World, whose foreign obligations have climbed above $900 billion, might default on their enormous foreign debts. That would inflict a heavy blow on the biggest Western banks and endanger the world financial system. **********Until the early 1980's, the orthodox, Keynesian solution for a nation's problems of insufficient growth, overcapacity and unemployment has been for the Government to increase the demand for the goods and services that a nation has the capacity to produce. The prescription for increasing demand has been to cut taxes, step up Government spending and enlarge the budget deficit. **********But the huge buildup of the American budget deficits and the total national debt of more than $2 trillion make traditional solutions obsolete. With the United States so dependent on capital from abroad, it is difficult and even dangerous for the nation to escape its burdens simply by increasing total demand through still greater increases in public and private borrowing. The harvest could be heightened inflationary pressure, a slowing inflow or even an outflow of foreign capital, a decline in investment and further loss of international competitiveness. **********What do these new conditions imply for economic policy? The greatest change appears to be that the unit for policy thinking must become the world economy rather than the national economy. The United States has been pushing in that direction, focusing its immediate efforts on a realignment of exchange rates, with the dollar moving down and the mark and the yen rising. THE decline started in late February 1985, but the Plaza agreement fortified the decline - and strengthened the bull market in stocks and bonds around the world. The dollar's fall continued into 1986, but after the middle of the year Japan and West Germany resisted further depreciation, fearing loss of export markets. The United States urged both countries, if they wished to avoid further dollar depreciation, to use fiscal and monetary policy, especially tax reform and lower interest rates, to spur the growth of their own economies. **********Japan and the Europeans insisted, however, that the problems of global imbalance and stagnation were the Americans' fault, a consequence of the Reagan Administration's huge and continuous budget deficits. They contended that the United States had failed to deliver on its part of the Plaza agreement - bringing down the budget deficit as the Europeans and Japanese accepted depreciation of the dollar. **********President Reagan has, at least rhetorically, accepted the gravity of the budget deficit; in his State of the Union message he called the deficit ''outrageous,'' drawing an uproarious, if somewhat mocking and comic response from the Democrats, who seek to hold him responsible. **********In briefing reporters on the new Economic Report of the President last Thursday, Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, accepted the European and Japanese view; he said the Federal budget deficit and the trade deficit were ''two very important problems'' that were linked. **********Mr. Baker's effort to persuade the others to go along with the American approach has been reinforced by the latent threat of American protectionism. Foreigners know that Mr. Reagan, politically weakened by the Republican loss of the Senate and by the Iran-contra affair, could have more trouble in staving off protectionist legislation from the 100th Congress. Legislators, however, appear to be looking for ways to avoid naked protectionism, whether through ''market-opening'' approaches and a productivity-based ''competitiveness'' campaign. **********These are extemely difficult tasks but the United States, even with its weakened economic position in the world, seems determined to work at their solutions. **********The most important aim of economic cooperation in the year ahead will be to keep the world economy moving forward. For within a pattern of growth the serious problems of world debt, trade and currency imbalances can be contained, and progress can be made toward their solution. **********Despite the resistance of traditional national politics and interest-group pressures, the development of internationally integrated fiscal and monetary policies has become vital to the economic well-being of every country.  THE DECLINE: A CHRONOLOGY **********Jan. 17, 1985 - With the dollar rising, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan says the United States will intervene in currency markets, acting jointly with other nations to force the dollar down. **********Jan. 21 - Western nations begin selling dollars from their reserves to halt its sharp rise. **********Late February - The dollar hits its peak of 263 yen and 3.44 West German marks. **********March 1 - With imports rising sharply, President Reagan officially backs intervention in the currency markets as a means of reining in the dollar. Soon after the announcement, the dollar begins the decline that has continued to this day. **********Sept. 22 - At the Plaza Hotel in New York, the United States, Britain, France, Japan and West Germany agree to work in concert to drive down the dollar. Although the group takes no specific actions and announces no numerical targets, the threat of intervention spurs widespread dollar selling. **********Feb. 20, 1986 - With the dollar down about 30 percent since the Plaza meeting, Paul A. Volcker, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, states in Congressional testimony that the dollar has dropped enough and expresses concern that a protracted decline may undermine confidence in the currency. **********March 25 - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone attempts to talk down the value of the yen and threatens intervention, but traders continue to drive down the dollar. **********Oct. 31 - At a Washington meeting, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa reportedly agree that the dollar should not sink lower than approximately 155 yen. Japan says it will stimulate its economy and cuts its discount rate to a post-war low of 3 percent. The dollar rises sharply on news of the agreement. **********November - The United States' monthly trade deficit rises to a recordf of $19.2 billion. Though later revised downward, the data are taken as a sign that the declining dollar has not yet achieved the long-awaited improvement in the nation's balance of trade. **********Jan. 11, 1987 - Turbulence in European currency markets, caused in part by a weak dollar, prompts the seven nations of the European Monetary System to realign their currencies. **********Jan. 14 - Facing intense political pressure to curb the trade deficit, the Administration leaks word that it wants the dollar to decline further. **********Jan. 16 - The dollar has lost 3.7 percent of its value against the mark and 2.6 percent against the yen in one week, despite heavy intervention by the Bundesbank and the Central Bank of Japan. **********Jan. 20 - Japan's Mr. Miyazawa flies to Washington to talk with Treasury Secretary Baker, hoping to get his help in arresting the dollar's slide. Mr. Baker refuses to make any firm pledges, and the dollar continues its decline. **********Jan. 21 - The dollar falls further, despite a discount-rate cut by West Germany, and ends the week at 153.75 yen and 1.8325 marks. **********Jan. 30 - The United States reports that its trade deficit narrowed to $10.6 billion in December, its lowest level since March 1985.  - AUDREY D.
