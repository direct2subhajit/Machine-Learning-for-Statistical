Here was a country that deeply humiliated the United States by kidnapping our diplomats, burning our flag, and we still have vivid memories of blindfolded Americans being paraded around our embassy there in Teheran. And there is, in the hearts of the American people, an understandable animosity, a hatred really, to Khomeini's Iran. **********The President and Iran **********I feel that way myself, to be very honest with you. **********And so does the President, who has been vilified time and time again by Iran's radical leaders. We're told that most Iranians feel the same way about us, the country that they call the Great Satan. **********And so why have anything to do with them? **********I'm sorry I didn't bring a map, but if you look at a map, Iran is all that stands between the Soviets and the gulf oil states. It's all that stands between the Soviets and a warm water port. Either a disintegrating Iran or an overly powerful Iran could threaten the stability of the entire Middle East and especially those moderate Arab states, our friends, whose stability and independence are absolutely vital to the national security of the United States. **********We may not like the current Iranian regime, and I've said we don't. But it would be irresponsible to ignore its geopolitical and strategic importance. And that doesn't mean we should simply appease any Iranian regime. It does mean, however, that we can't ignore this looming transition that will soon take place in Iran. **********Khomeini will pass from the scene. **********A successor regime will take power. **********And we must be positioned to serve America's interests and indeed the interests of the entire free world. Apart from the strategic reasons, humanitarian concern about American hostages in Lebanon provided another reason to open a channel to Iran. **********The Iranians themselves are not holding our hostages. Hostages and Influence **********But we believe they have influence over those who do hold some of our hostages. **********But let me add something very important. **********In spite of our bitter feelings toward Iran's leadership, we would've tried to begin a dialogue with Iran whether we had hostages in Lebanon or not. **********In fact for three years prior to the first hostage kidnapping, this Administration attempted to find reliable, hopefully moderate, Iranian channels through which to conduct a responsible dialogue. **********And more recently, we've been receiving intelligence that pragmatic elements within Iran were beginning to appreciate certain sobering realities. To the east, in Afghanistan, we estimate 115,000 Soviet troops are committing atrocities on Iran's Islamic brothers. To the north, 26 Soviet divisions right there on Iran's border for whatever opportunities might arise. To the west, Iran is engaged in a war of unbelievably horrible human dimensions - war with Iraq. 12-year-old kids, 14-year-old kids pressed into service and then ground up in combat. Unemployment in Iran **********And at home, Iran is tetering on the economic brink right there in its own front yard a 40 percent unemployment rate. Many Iranian leaders understand that their own survival and certainly the rebuiling of their economy may depend on normalizing ties with their neighbors and with the Western World. **********And so we, for our reasons, and certain elements in Iran for their reasons, in spite of this mutual hatred, began a tentative probing dialogue which brings us to another question: **********How can the United States Government have a policy against countries sending arms to Iran and then turn around and itself send arms? **********I understand, I know the American people simply don't understand this. And when we started talking to the Iranians, both sides were deeply suspicious of each other, and remain so, I might say. **********Those Iranians who were taking enormous personal risks by just talking to us felt that they needed a signal that their risks were worth it. And we were told the signal that they required and we gave them that signal by selling a limited amount of arms, about one-tenth of 1 percent of the arms that have been supplied by other countries. .... **********But you must remain true to your principles and I can tell you that the President is absolutely convinced that he did not swap arms for hostages. And still the question remains of how the Administration could violate its own policy of not selling arms to Iran. **********Simple human hope explains it perhaps better than anything else. **********The President hoped that we could open a channel that would serve the interests of the United States and of our allies in a variety of ways. Call it leadership. Given 20-20 hindsight, call it a mistaken tactic if you want to. It was risky but potentially of long-term value. **********The shaping of the Iranian policy involved difficult choices. As complex as the public debate on the issue would be, the matter was further clouded by the way in which the President's goals were executed. Specifically allegations about certain activities of the National Security Council staff. Clearly mistakes were made. Our policy of conducting a dialogue with Iran, which was legitimate and arguable, has become entangled with the separate matter of this N.S.C. investigation. President's Disclosures **********A week ago Monday afternoon, the President learned of proper, of possible improprieties. A week ago Monday. On Tuesday, he disclosed the problem to the public and instructed the Attorney General to go forward with a full investigation. On Wednesday, he created a bipartisan commision, outstanding three individuals, outstanding individuals, to review the role of the N.S.C. staff and make recommendations for the future. And just yesterday, he moved to appoint, have the court appoint an independent counsel to insure a full accounting for any possible wrongdoing. **********The President pledged full cooperation with the United States Congress, urging it to consolidate and expedite its inquiry. Yesterday, he also named Frank Carlucci, a seasoned professional with broad experience so well-known to many people here, to serve as his national security adviser. **********Now this is fast action in anybody's book. And these are actions I fully support and which I believe the American people will judge commendable. And the President has moved swiftly, strongly. But let me add this: I am convinced that he will take whatever additional steps may be necessary to get things back on track and get our foreign policy moving forward. **********As the elected representatives of, of all the people, the President and the Vice President, he and I have a duty to preserve the public trust and uphold the laws of this country and we teke, take that duty very very seriously. Decision of President **********I'd like to say something about my own role in all of this. I was aware of our Iran initiative and I support the President's decision. And I was not aware of and I oppose any diversion of funds, any ransom payments or any circumvention of the will of the Congress or the law of the United States of America. **********And as the various investigations proceed, I have this to say: let the chips fall where they may. We want the truth. The President wants it. I want it. And the American people have a fundamental right to it. And if the truth hurts, so be it. We gotta take our lumps and move ahead. **********Politics do not matter. Personalities do not matter. Those who've served the President haven't served the President well don't matter. What matters is the United States of America. And we mustn't allow our foreign policy to become paralyzed by distraction. There can be no denying that our credibility has been damaged by this, this entire episode and its aftermath. **********We have a critical role to play internationally and I intend to help the President tackle the challenges that lie before us in the last two years of this Administration. Putting U.S.-Soviet relations on a new footing, pursuing a breakthrough in arms reduction, building on the potential that I saw so clearly just this past summer for making new strides for peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors, working to end apartheid and creating a more hopeful future for all Africans, solidifying the remarkable changes taking place in Asia, combating international terrorism in close conjunction with our allies, and, of course, fostering the development of democracy in Central America. And let me add, the freedom of the people of Central America should not, must not, be held hostage to actions unrelated to them. This nation's support of those who are fighting for democracy in Nicaragua should stand on its own merits, not hang upon events related to Iran. Foreign Policy Programs **********The Marxist-Leninist regime in Managua must not benefit from the errors of some people in Washington. Our Administration has a duty to follow a foreign policy that reflects the values of its citizens. **********This sounds simple and yet it is often, as so many of you here know, a very complex matter. It's not easy translating general values into specific foreign policy programs and this is why there's always so much internal debate over our nation's role in world affairs from Iran to arms reduction. ..."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/27/business/business-people-a-founder-of-giorgio-tries-a-solo-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 366, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Founder of Giorgio Tries a Solo Venture", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; A Founder of Giorgio Tries a Solo Venture", "body_text": " **********Ever since she was a little girl growing up in New York, Gale Hayman has had a passion for fragrances. **********At the age of 10, she bought small vials of perfume at a Woolworth's for 15 cents each.

No Hope Seen for Contras **********In all four countries, he said, officials favored continued pressure on Nicaragua, both economically and politically, and they saw the contras as part of that pressure. But they doubted the rebels' effectiveness. ''There is a general sense that the contras do not constitute a reasonable alternative to the Sandinistas,'' Senator Sasser reported. ''They are simply a force that can bring pressure. They do not have the military capability to overthrow the Sandinistas, and in the unlikely event that that occurred, they don't have the political capability to run the country.'' **********The Senator said he would support it now only as a last resort, if Nicaragua refused to negotiate with the United States, halt subversion of its neighbors, and end internal political oppression. **********In the text of his speech, Mr. Shultz lists similar goals as the purpose of aid to the rebels, avoiding mention of the overthrow of the Sandinista regime.

Aquino, defending her approach to combating the Communist insurgency in the Philippines, said today that she would not submit to the sort of pressure from Washington on this and other issues that she said her predecessor, Ferdinand E. Marcos, had been subjected to. **********She also said she would not respond to anonymous criticisms such as those leveled on Sunday by unidentified Reagan Administration officials, who said she should get tougher with the Communists and other insurgents. **********Mrs. Aquino said the criticism did not appear to have come from President Reagan, but from individuals who might not want her to succeed. She learned of the criticism from an article in The New York Times on Monday. **********'It Is I Who Will Decide' **********''Until it is said right to my face, until President Reagan tells me, 'Look, you're not doing it the way we think you should,' then I'll tell him why I think it should be done this way,'' she said. **********''The fact is, it is I who will decide just what we will do in this country,'' she said in an interview in her office. ''So a lot of other people can state or voice their opinions, and what matters in the long run is whether I will accept some of these recommendations or not.'' At the end of the interview, Mrs. Aquino was asked whether, after almost six months in office, she was enjoying being President. **********''No, the enjoyment is not there,'' she said. **********''But more than anything else, I feel that I have been given a great responsibility. And I am more than ever determined first of all that I give my very best efforts to the success of this Government, and more important to do everything possible to bring about a better life for the Filipino people.'' **********Mrs. Aquino is to meet with Mr. Reagan in Washington on Sept. 17 and to address a joint meeting of Congress the next day, before visiting Boston and New York, where she will speak before the United Nations. **********She said a main goal of her visit to the United States would be to seek more favorable terms from creditor banks and more open markets for Philippine goods. Her approach to counterinsurgency and her policies on two important American military bases in the Philippines were expected to be among the leading issues discussed.  [ Informed of Mrs. Aquino's comments, an Administration official in Santa Barbara, Calif., repeated tonight that there was concern about her handling of insurgencies and that the subject was ''bound to be an issue at some level'' on her trip to Washington. The official, who asked not to be identified, said he expected the talks to be dominated by a discussion of the Philippines' economic plight. ]  Mrs. Aquino said she hoped her meeting with Mr. Reagan would lead to a ''personal and lasting friendship'' that could benefit both nations. She said she respected Mr. Reagan's loyalty to the man she ousted, Mr. Marcos. **********''I do not discount the possibility that not everyone wants me to succeed in the U.S. visit,'' she said, referring to the criticism leveled at her. ''I would imagine there are a number who would really like to derail whatever efforts are made in seeking something mutually advantageous for both countries.'' **********She said Mr. Marcos was particularly subject to pressure from Washington because he ''no longer enjoyed the support of the Filipino people and had to look elsewhere to prop him up.'' **********''This is a different government,'' she said, adding that the relationship ''should be one of mutual respect.'' **********Mrs. Aquino repeated her commitment to seek a peaceful solution to the Communist insurgency and also to her policy of honoring the agreement on American bases until it expires in 1991 and of keeping open her options after that. Criticizes Military Approach **********She said that a purely military approach to counterinsurgency had failed under Mr. Marcos and that she intended to ''exhaust all peaceful efforts'' before resorting to ''our last option, and that will be using force against force.'' **********She acknowledged that cease-fire talks, which began a month ago, had gotten off to a slow start, but she added that when two forces have been fighting for years, ''first of all what has to be established is a show of sincerity on both sides, and I guess that takes time.'' **********She said it was precisely to show her sincerity that she planned to fly to a southern island Friday to meet with a leader of the Moslem separatist insurgency, Nur Misuari. **********Mrs. Aquino said she was taking the unusual step of visiting him in his home area ''because I believe that it is important for me to make known to Nur Misuari that I am very sincere in my efforts at peace.'' **********''And once I have shown this, then it is his turn to reciprocate this expression of sincerity,'' she said. **********On the sensitive issue of the bases, Mrs. Aquino said she would assure the Americans that her policy has not changed and that ''I will respect the bases up to 1991, I am keeping my options open, and that there will be negotiations, renegotiations, if both parties want to renegotiate.'' **********Asked whether she believed that the bases would one day have to go, she said, ''I guess so at some future date,'' but she added that the future was impossible to foretell."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/06/world/tokyo-subway-traffic-disrupted-by-a-series-of-small-explosions.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1986-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 991, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TOKYO SUBWAY TRAFFIC DISRUPTED BY A SERIES OF SMALL EXPLOSIONS", "print_headline": "TOKYO SUBWAY TRAFFIC DISRUPTED BY A SERIES OF SMALL EXPLOSIONS", "body_text": " **********Small explosions went off in several subway stations across the city this morning at the height of rush hour as Tokyo residents returned to work after a long holiday weekend. **********The police said they had no reports of injuries or damage. The explosives, which were placed in trash cans, on subway tracks, in washrooms and in newsstands, appeared to be smoke bombs and firecracker-like explosives encased in plastic boxes and equipped with timing devices. **********One explosive went off on a train car, and some were reported to have caused small fires. **********A spokesman for the Teito Rapid Transit Authority, which administers part of Tokyo's subway system, said explosives had been discovered at 17 subway stations, most of them heavily traveled terminuses or downtown stations. **********The police said they had not established a firm connection between this morning's explosions and Sunday's attack on Japan's state guesthouse. Suspicion, however, is focusing on a radical left-wing group that claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack and blew up railway communication links last November. **********This morning's explosions occurred between 8 A.M. and 8:30 A.M. at the height of the morning rush hour, causing brief disruptions of service at several stations. **********The subway authority spokesmen also said that reports of dynamite at Tokyo's Ikebukuro Station caused it to be evacuated this morning. Subway trains did not stop at the station for an hour, he said, but added that normal service had been restored by late morning. **********The radical left-wing group, the Chukakuha, or Middle Core Faction, distributed leaflets on Monday taking responsibility for firing five homemade rockets Sunday at Japan's state guest house, where leaders of the economic meeting were welcomed. **********The group boasted of its ability to elude the tightest security net ever cast in Tokyo, and the police increased the extraordinary level of security even further as the group threatened another attack. **********Speaking of the missile attack, Takuro Suzuki, an author who has written widely about crime and the police in Japan, said ''They chose the exact time when the attack would have worldwide news value.'' Fired From an Apartment **********The rockets, fired at the Akasaka Palace from an apartment building 1.7 miles away, overshot their target and landed harmlessly on the street and near buildings near the Canadian Embassy, south of the palace grounds. They had little explosive force, but they passed over the palace only minutes after Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone greeted President Francois Mitterrand in an outdoor ceremony and 15 minutes before President Reagan received his formal welcome there. **********On Monday, the police stepped up checks of cars and passers-by, and said they would extend their surveillance beyond the neighborhood from which the rockets were launched. Before the attack, security checks were largely confined to within one mile of the palace, which is the official guest house of the Japanese Government. **********The police on Monday began distributing 100,000 leaflets asking for cooperation in their investigation from residents and landlords of apartment houses within a 2.5-mile radius of the palace. Building Now a Curiosity **********Overnight, the apartment building in the quiet Yaraicho neighborhood from which the rockets were fired became a curiosity. Residents gathered in groups and speculated on how the attack's planners could have carried it out. One man, out walking his dog, smiled and said, ''Pretty well done, don't you think?'' **********The group that took responsibility is one of Japan's largest and most active radical organizations and has taken responsibility for several similar attacks using crude rockets fired from the trunks of cars. **********The group, which has been in the forefront of demonstrations against the construction of Tokyo's new international airport at Narita, also blew up railway communications links and tracks last November, paralyzing much of Tokyo's commuter rail system. **********Mr. Suzuki said that although the Chukakuha mentioned the American bombing of Libya in the leaflet claiming responsibility, the group did not appear to have ties to foreign terrorist groups. And although it is one of Japan's most violent groups, its attacks have not extended to random slayings of civilians. Monthly $250 Donations **********Mr. Suzuki said most of the members of the Chukakuha held jobs and appeared to lead normal lives. But many of them donate about $250 to $300 a month to the organization, and a hard-core group of 300 to 400 have organized themselves into what they call a revolutionary army. **********Although the police set up several checkpoints in the Yaraicho area Monday, questioning drivers and opening car trunks, they did not seem very much in evidence during a drive Monday evening through other neighborhoods within the expanded security zone. **********The police did not enter homes in the area, which would require search warrants, but they asked apartment residents and landlords to report anything suspicious. **********The police were clearly jittery. Shortly after 10 P.M. Monday, a report of an explosion near the Hotel New Otani, which houses most of the delegations to the summit meeting, prompted the authorities to seal off all exits from the hotel for 15 minutes. Police Take Note of Passes **********Even after it was determined that nothing was amiss, the police insisted on taking down the pass numbers of everyone leaving the hotel. **********None of the canisters launched in the attacks Sunday appear to have contained enough explosives to cause extensive damage or to kill someone unless a victim were actually struck by one, the police said. **********In their investigation of the incident, the authorities cordoned off the apartment building from which the rockets were fired. The police said the apartment contained a refrigerator, a washing machine, a television set and a mattress, but not much more. **********Although dishes were in the kitchen sink, the police said they believed no one had actually lived in the fourth-floor apartment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/18/business/advertising-bigger-prize-to-winner-of-stephen-kelly-award.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1986-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 290, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bigger Prize to Winner Of Stephen Kelly Award", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Bigger Prize to Winner Of Stephen Kelly Award", "body_text": " **********When it comes to advertising awards, the Stephen E.

And it is likely to be amended during debate on the Senate floor this month. Under the House bill, for example, an individual's contributions to a 401(k) employee retirement plan would reduce dollar-for-dollar the amount of tax-deductible contributions he or she could make to an Individual Retirement Account. Under the Senate committee bill, no I.R.A. deduction could be claimed by a taxpayer who is covered by a pension plan. But interest earned on I.R.A. contributions could still grow tax-free until withdrawn. **********But the House and Senate committee plans are similar to each other in many respects, providing a strong indication of Congressional sentiment. Under both proposals, tax rates would be cut sharply. The top rate, now 50 percent would fall to 27 percent in the Senate committee blueprint and 38 percent in the House plan, benefiting all profitable investments that are taxed at regular rates, such as stock dividends, money market funds, bank accounts, corporate and Federal Government bonds and other fixed-income investments. By contrast, tax-free municipal bonds would lose some of their appeal. **********''The dollar benefit of shelter is reduced with lower rates,'' said David A. Berenson, director of national tax policy at the accounting firm of Ernst & Whinney. A $1 deduction is now worth 50 cents to an investor in the top bracket. But if that bracket falls to 27 percent, the deduction's value will fall to 27 cents. **********Wealthy professionals and executives still eager to shelter income will find both tax plans take a number of direct swipes at the enticing write-offs that have lured many to tax shelters, such as depreciation deductions and the investment tax credit. **********In addition, the amount of tax shelter paper losses that investors could use to offset taxes owed on other income would be curtailed. The Senate made a rental-property-management exception for all but the wealthiest investors; losses of up to $25,000 could be deducted. Another limited exception was made for investors in certain oil and gas drilling ventures. **********While the tax debate is weeks or perhaps months away from resolution, many investments that people enter into now might be adversely affected if the proposals are enacted, even if the House agrees to go along with the Senate timetable of Jan. 1, 1987, instead of making provisions retroactive to last Jan. 1. **********''The immediate impact in real estate investments is to depress their value significantly,'' said Byrle Abbin, managing director of Federal tax services at the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Company. **********As a result, tax advisers are cautioning clients to be watchful of certain provisions - even if they exist in only one bill. For example, the Senate Finance plan would eliminate the preferential tax treatment of long-term capital gains on stocks, precious metals, real property and artwork and other collectibles. These gains, now taxed at a maximum rate of 20 percent, would be taxed like wages at rates up to 27 percent. **********Stock market investors should also be watchful of tax changes affecting corporations. Some companies - particularly high-tech and service-oriented companies - are likely to benefit from an overhaul of the tax system. But many capital intensive companies would face a higher tax burden under the proposals, and thus profitability might decline."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/21/world/nicaragua-formally-charges-hasenfus.html": {"writer_name": "James Lemoyne", "pub_date": "1986-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 672, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NICARAGUA FORMALLY CHARGES HASENFUS", "print_headline": "NICARAGUA FORMALLY CHARGES HASENFUS", "body_text": " **********Eugene Hasenfus, the American captured when a rebel supply plane was downed over Nicaragua two weeks ago, was charged here today with several political crimes carrying a maximum sentence of 30 years. **********The charges - terrorism, association to commit illicit acts and violation of the public security law - were made before a tribunal for political offenses. **********The trial could last more than a month, and statements by Mr. Hasenfus to the press and police can be used against him. **********Mr. Hasenfus sat quietly in the sweltering courtroom as the charges were read for more than an hour while schoolgirls looked on and American political activists took photographs. **********The defendant's wife, Sally, and his brother, William, stood behind him.

ON DENTIST RULING", "body_text": " **********The Supreme Court, reiterating that professional groups enjoy no special privilege to restrain competition, today ruled unanimously that a group of Indiana dentists had acted illegally in boycotting an insurance cost-containment program. **********The Court upheld a Federal Trade Commission ruling that the Indiana Federation of Dentists had violated the antitrust laws by conspiring to refuse to submit dental X-rays to insurers along with patients' insurance claim forms. **********The Justices said the F.T.C. had been correct in ruling that the boycott was illegal because it was designed to restrain a form of competition among dentists for patients. **********The decision reversed a Federal appellate ruling that had encouraged some other professional groups hoping to limit their antitrust liability for actions they defend as necessary to uphold professional ethics and standards. But experts said it was consistent with previous Supreme Court decisions and did not significantly change the law. **********The insurers wanted the X-rays to help determine whether some claims should be rejected as more costly than necessary for appropriate treatment. The dentists argued, and the appellate court ruled, that their boycott was an ''ethical and moral policy designed to enhance the welfare of dental patients.'' They said they were concerned that insurers might erroneously decide on the basis of X-rays to decline to pay for needed treatment, depriving patients of adequate care. **********But Justice Byron R. White's opinion for the Court strongly rejected this argument, equating it with the view that ''an unrestrained market in which consumers are given access to the information they believe to be relevant to their choices will lead them to make unwise and even dangerous choices.'' **********This, he said, was contrary to ''the basic policy of the Sherman Act'' that free competition and exchange of information were the best protections for consumers. **********Noting that dental insurers have an incentive to provide adequate coverage because they ''are themselves in competition for the patronage of the patients,'' Justice White said the dentists had produced no evidence that ''the careful use of X-rays as a basis for evaluating insurance claims is in fact destructive of proper standards of dental care.'' **********The decision in the case, Federal Trade Commission v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, No. 84-1809, along with other Supreme Court rulings over the last decade, will strengthen the hand of the F.T.C., which has devoted much of its activity in recent years to enforcing antitrust laws against physicians, dentists and other professionals who were once considered immune from antitrust liability. **********In the Indiana case, the F.T.C. had ordered that the dentists ''cease and desist'' from the boycott. **********Citing evidence that advocates of the boycott had feared the insurance companies' cost-containment efforts would put pressure on them to reduce their fees, Justice White also rejected the appellate court's ruling that the boycott had not necessarily had an anti-competitive effect. **********He said the lower court's ruling was contrary both to ''common sense'' and to the evidence. Applying the traditional antitrust ''rule of reason,'' he said there was so little evident justification for the boycott that it was not necessary for the F.T.C. to prove that it had in fact resulted in higher prices for dental services. **********Justice White noted that dental patients have reason to want their dentists to cooperate with their insurance companies so that their claims will be paid. He said that ''a concerted and effective effort to withhold (or make more costly) information desired by consumers for the purpose of determining whether a particular purchase is cost-justified is likely enough to disrupt the proper functioning of the price-setting mechanism of the market that it may be condemned even absent proof that it resulted in higher prices, or, as here, the purchase of higher-priced services, than would occur in its absence.'' **********Some professional groups concerned about antitrust liability took comfort from the fact that the Court noted that ''we have been slow to condemn rules adopted by professional associations as unreasonable per se,'' and left open the possibility that ''concern for the quality of patient care could under some circumstances serve as a justification for a restraint of the sort imposed here.'' Bering Sea Oil Appeals **********The Court also agreed to hear this fall two appeals from an appellate ruling that halted for environmental reasons oil and gas exploration on two tracts on the outer continental shelf in the Bering Sea off Alaska that were leased by the Interior Department to eight oil companies. **********The Court consolidated the appeals by the oil companies and by the Government, which argued that the appellate ruling could ''throw into doubt'' exploration activities on hundreds of other leases and ''put at grave risk'' $4.2 billion received by the Treasury for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since 1980. (Amoco Production Co. v. Village of Gambell, No. 85-1239; Hodel v. Village of Gambell, No. 85-1406.)

''But instead we got the invasion of Normandy.'' #2 Raids Unsuccessful The Government announced that two raids were conducted today, but that only ''normal activity'' was found because the sites turned out to be ordinary ranches, not cocaine laboratories. **********In Washington, Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, denied strongly that the United States had forced Bolivia to do anything. **********''The operation was very closely coordinated over a period of months with President Paz and the Government of Bolivia,'' Mr. Abrams said. 'We Would Have Changed It' **********''The plans were joint plans,'' he said, ''and had they disliked any part of the plan, we would have changed it.'' **********White House and State Department officials said earlier this week that 160 American servicemen and six Army Black Hawk helicopters armed with .30-caliber machine guns were sent here ''at the request of the Bolivian Government.'' **********Edward P. Djerejian, the White House spokesman, said Wednesday that the military unit sent to Bolivia would provide ''important logistical support'' to the Bolivian Army and the national police. The operation, he added, was part of the Administration's campaign against what he called ''narco-terrorism.'' Criticism of Bolivians Cited **********A senior American official acknowledged that the Bolivians had been asking for help ''but they didn't specifically ask for military help.'' **********Another official said that he believed the statements by the Bolivian officials were meant to respond to criticism in Bolivia and elsewhere about Bolivia's admission of American military forces into the country. ''This kind of line may help Bolivia with its internal squabbles, but it doesn't help them much here,'' the official said. **********He also said the 160 American military personnel involved were not combat troops, with the exception of the gunners on the helicopters. The 160, he said, consist of the various types of support forces needed to keep the six helicopters in the air. Offer Said to Surprise President **********American officials say they believe one key concern held by the Bolivians is that one or more Bolivians could be shot and perhaps killed during the operations by American military forces, an idea the Americans say is highly unlikely. **********When the American Ambassador, Edward M. Rowell, told Mr. Paz Estenssoro late last month that Washington was offering to send troops, the President ''was surprised,'' Mr. Liebermann said. **********He added that the President accepted the offer partly because the Government is interested in fighting the cocaine trade, but also because of ''what we call the difference in power.'' **********''We in Latin America, especially Bolivia with all its weaknesses, have to accept certain things from the north that we might not accept if we were stronger,'' he said. **********Bolivia, the second poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, after Haiti, ''is broke,'' according to Edgar Bernal, the economic attache in the Bolivian Embassy in Washington. ''We have no money, zero.'' Financial Considerations Cited **********In that circumstance, the American decision in mid-June to withhold $7.2 million in economic aid because Bolivia had not made enough progress eradicating its huge coca crop was painful to the Bolivians. **********Although that money has already been re-asasigned to other purposes in Washington, Congress is debating how much money to give Bolivia next year. Bolivian and American officials said that fact certainly played in Mr. Paz Estenssoro's mind when he decided to accept the offer of troops. **********The presence of American troops in almost any Latin American country would present problems for its Government, and Mr. Liebermann said ''it's been rather rough'' for the Paz Estenssoro administration. **********When the first cooperative raid against a cocaine lab ended Friday evening, the Bolivian Information Minister, Herman Antelo, went to great lengths to characterize the American assistance as ''technical'' and ''logistical,'' adding: ''I want to say most emphatically, this is not an American troop deployment.'' Raids Find 'Normal Activity' **********Two more raids were launched at dawn today, the Bolivian Government announced this afternoon, but when the American helicopters carrying about 15 Bolivian drug strike force officers and an American drug-enforcement agency officer landed, they found only ''normal activity,'' Mr. Antelo said. The sites were ordinary ranches, not cocaine laboratories. **********Mr. Antelo also said a second raid had been conducted Friday, but the strike force also found only ''normal activity.'' He also released new details today about the one cocaine lab that was raided Friday. **********Mr. Antelo said peasants in the area, when interviewed by Bolivian policemen, said the lab was ringed with armed guards last Sunday as numerous airplanes landed and took off, ferrying equipment away. This indicated that the traffickers had been alerted to plans for the raid even before American troops reached Bolivia on Tuesday. Teen-Age Boy Seized **********Nonetheless, an airplane landed at one of two airstrips near the lab while the raid was under way. The pilot and a 17-year-old boy got out of the plane and saw the police, then tried to flee. The pilot got away, but the boy, identified as Luis Fernando, was arrested. It was the only arrest in the raids so far. The small plane was loaded with cocaine processing chemicals. **********Mr. Antelo said the lab had been a huge installation with 15 separate buildings and semi-permanent tents that served as living quarters for about 75 people. It had a playground for children, an adult recreation area with a basketball court, a cafeteria, and what looked like an extensive cocaine processing lab. **********Most of the equipment had been removed before the raid, and the remaining facilities were dismantled, the Bolivian Government said. **********Reports about the raid and especially the American presence here have filled the newspapers for the last few days. Opposition members of Congress have complained that the Bolivian public has not seemed deeply concerned. **********Still, Mr. Liebermann said, ''We will have problems from this'' when the Bolivian Congress reconvenes this year. ''But I think we will be able to it,'' he added, depending on how the raids turn out. A 'Fragile Democracy' **********American officials say they are being charitable when they describe Bolivia as a ''fragile democracy.'' Over the last 30 years there have been dozens of coups. **********Asked to describe in a word the Bolivian Government's feelings about the American troop deployment, given the situation here, Mr. Liebermann paused and said: ''Resigned.'' The operation, whose origins date to 1983, marks a turning point in the American and Bolivian program to reduce this nation's role as a leading source of cocaine. **********Three years ago, Bolivia, the world's second-largest coca producer, ''was wide open,'' Donald J. Yellman, director of the State Department's Narcotics Assistance Unit here, said in an interview. **********In August 1983, Bolivia signed its first narcotics assistance agreement with the United States. Its emphasis was on eradicating the nation's coca crop, and in the agreement Bolivia said it would eradicate just over 10 percent of the roughly 90,000 acres planted in coca by the end of 1985. Program Backed by U.S. The United States would pay for all the work, help the coca farmers find new sources of income and train and equip an elite narcotics enforcement strike force, called the Leopards. **********The problem was that Bolivia's economy in the 1980's has been in a shambles. The Gross National Product has fallen by as much as 10 percent a year, and the inflation rate, stabilized in recent months, was at one point among the highest in world history. **********Last month, President Paz Estenssorro estimated that cocaine exports brought the nation $600 million a year while all legal exports combined brought in about $500 million. **********A year after signing the agreement, the former government of President Hernan Siles Zuazo sent the Bolivian Army into the Chapare region, where one-quarter of the world's coca leaf grows. The Chapare had been a violent, autonomous society ruled by drug traffickers. Turmoil in the Capital **********The army occupation caused political turmoil in La Paz. The occupation ended quickly, and the drug traffickers went back to business as usual. **********Last November, with the deadline for eradicating 10,000 acres of coca looming, the new administration of President Paz Estenssoro tried a different approach. **********The Government offered to pay coca farmers $350 for every hectare of coca taken out of production. A hectare is about 2.5 acres. But Bolivian and American officials now say the program has failed. Coca farmers can earn as much as $10,000 a year for every hectare of coca leaf sold to drug traffickers. **********''We have to try another approach, .'' Mr. Yellman said. That approach is to disrupt the cocaine processing industry so that the market for coca leaves diminishes. That, American and Bolivian officials hope, will prompt many farmers to abandon coca farming. **********The new approach got under way early this year. Bolivia sent the Leopard strike force into the Chapare, where the Leopards have been destroying coca paste laboratories. **********In the Chapare, the coca leaf is converted to a paste that is flown to the sophisticated laboratories, like the one raided Friday, in the Beni region northeast of the Chapare, where it is refined into the final product, cocaine hydrochloride. Much of the paste is also flown to Colombia. **********One big problem was that the cocaine labs continued operating in the Beni region which, unlike the Chapare, is inaccessible by road. Mr. Liebermann said the Bolivian Government had hoped Washington would lend or give Bolivia some helicopters. **********Instead, the Reagan Administration offered the military assistance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/06/business/us-oil-companies-in-libya-face-june-30-cutoff.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1986-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 686, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. OIL COMPANIES IN LIBYA FACE JUNE 30 CUTOFF", "print_headline": "U.S. OIL COMPANIES IN LIBYA FACE JUNE 30 CUTOFF", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration has decided that by June 30 it will end the special exemptions allowing American oil companies to continue operating in Libya, senior State Department officials said today. **********The Administration made the decision last week, they said, so it could argue more credibly at the Tokyo summit meeting for America's allies to impose economic sanctions of their own against Libya. The decision, a senior official said, contributed to the anti-terrorist statement issued here today. **********The seven nations adopted a statement condemning terrorism and singling out Libya for particular criticism. But they stopped short of calling for economic sanctions. **********Despite Washington's antagonism to Libya, the ending of the temporary exemptions could provide a financial windfall for Tripoli.

He added, ''They will be out, one way or another, and it won't be very long.'' **********Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d also said at an evening news conference that ''at some point I think the United States has to be able to make the case to its allies, if we're asking them to take action, that there are no longer United States companies operating in Libya with the consent of the United States Government.'' 'Have to Pull the String' **********Earlier in the day, Mr. Baker said in a television interview that if the oil companies did not sell their assets in Libya by ''a certain date, then we'll probably just have to pull the string and say: 'Well, you've had all the time we can give you. You really got to leave.' '' **********Neither Mr. Shultz nor Mr. Baker would announce a deadline for when the companies must pull out of Libya. But senior State Department officials said it was agreed at an interagency meeting last week in advance of the summit conference that the special licenses would not be renewed beyond June 30. **********Following the airport attacks at Rome and Vienna last December, President Reagan announced a trade embargo against Libya, including the severing of all American commerce with that country. The embargo was to take effect Feb. 1, but at that time the Administration accepted the oil companies' argument that a pullout would give the Libyans a windfall. **********So the rules let any American companies stay in Libya temporarily if they would have to forfeit large sums to the Libyans by leaving abruptly. Earnings Go Into Escrow **********But the companies were told they had to liquidate their assets in Libya as soon as possible and in the meantime to put earnings from the oilfields in Libya into special escrow accounts. The oil companies had hoped to be able to sell their assets, such as oil-exploring equipment, to European concerns. But the Reagan Administration, seeking to persuade the Europeans and Japanese to halt their own oil trade with Libya, forbade that approach. In effect, this limited the companies to selling their assets only to the Libyans. **********Selling assets to the Libyans, however, would probably amount to a ''fire sale,'' Washington officials and oil executives agreed, since Libya would be under no pressure to pay more than a nominal amount. **********The main companies that were given licenses to keep operating were Amerada Hess, Du Pont's Conoco, W. R. Grace, U.S. Steel's Marathon and Occidental Petroleum. They ship about 500,000 barrels of Libyan crude oil to their European refineries daily. **********If they had been forced to liquidate their assets in February, the oil companies would have provided Libya with a windfall estimated as high as $1 billion. Assets Frozen in January **********But Secretary Baker said that when the sanctions were imposed on Libya in January, the United States also froze ''a substantial amount of Libyan assets,'' estimated then at $100 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/19/world/aquino-plans-a-pilot-program-for-rebel-amnesty.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1986-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 878, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AQUINO PLANS A PILOT PROGRAM FOR REBEL AMNESTY", "print_headline": "AQUINO PLANS A PILOT PROGRAM FOR REBEL AMNESTY", "body_text": " **********President Corazon C. Aquino has decided to offer Communist insurgents an amnesty plan that includes job training and safe haven for the rebels and their families, according to her aides. **********The aides said Mrs. Aquino would propose a pilot amnesty project in Mindanao, a major area of fighting, as a model to persuade guerrillas to give up their arms. **********Under plans being worked out by officials of her administration and the Roman Catholic Church, the guerrillas would be required to surrender their arms, and not merely vow to suspend attacks on Government soldiers, a knowledgeable official said. **********This stipulation has already been rejected by various Communist officials since Mrs. Aquino became President three weeks ago. **********Pressure is growing for Mrs. Aquino to take some action regarding the Communist fighting force, the New People's Army, which is estimated to have 20,000 to 30,000 guerrillas who control roughly 20 percent of the country. According to press reports, 64 soldiers, 25 rebels and 25 civilians have been killed in clashes since Feb. 26 - a pace somewhat slower than before Mrs. Aquino took office. An Aquino Campaign Promise **********In her presidential campaign Mrs. Aquino promised to offer a six-month cease-fire and an amnesty for insurgents who lay down their arms and renounce violence. **********The insurgency began in 1969 and has grown considerably in the last five years. Mrs. Aquino argued that economic and civil rights abuses under President Ferdinand E. Marcos had encouraged the large increases in the insurgents' ranks and that the war would abate with his departure. **********Senior Communist officials have said the insurgents are willing to discuss a cease-fire but would insist on several conditions, including ''reform'' of the military and an end to the ''fascist structure'' of private armies and local politicians who supported Mr. Marcos. **********The Communists asserted that armed revolution still appeared necessary because of American ''imperialism'' in the Philippines and ''feudal'' landowning practices. Communist Cites 'Common Goals' **********This position was reiterated today by Jose Maria Sison, the founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines, who was among the more than 500 political prisoners ordered released this month by Mrs. Aquino as a human rights gesture. **********Mr. Sison said amnesty talks should concentrate on ''common goals,'' which he identified as an end to land monopolies and American imperialism. Since no cease-fire has yet been proposed, he added, it is not surprising that guerrilla incidents are continuing. **********In the face of Communist skepticism and resistance, Government officials said Mrs. Aquino wanted not a broad-based amnesty plan, but a pilot program that would have the best chance of success. **********One of her advisers reiterated a campaign promise that should the amnesty proposal prove fruitless, Mrs. Aquino was prepared to resume the military effort against the insurgents. **********''She'll send in the army and crack down,'' the adviser said. ''But first she's going to make sure all the best efforts are made.'' Target Is 'Soft Core' Rebels **********He added that one part of the emerging strategy was to first coax ''soft core'' guerrillas to quit the war. Such rebels are described as those who are not doctrinaire Communists but took up arms to oppose abuses by the Marcos Government. **********This theory holds that the remaining guerrillas would have a reduced influence, particularly if the nation's economy revived. **********In contrast, Communist leaders have stressed that they have always viewed their struggle as a long effort, and they have asserted that there is no clear evidence that Mrs. Aquino is firmly in control as President or that the nation's basic policies have changed. **********Government officials offered no timetable for putting the pilot program into effect. They said preparations were still being made by church officials familiar with Mindanao, a large island of mountainous jungle terrain that has been one of the areas of greatest difficulty for the Government in fighting the insurgency. **********''Cory is emphasizing this has to be convincing and that we cannot be setting them up for reprisals once they surrender,'' an official said. He referred to the insurgents' distrust of provincial soldiers and civilian home-defense forces accused of abusing local peasants. The home-defense forces include armed groups controlled by local politicians, groups that the Aquino Government has vowed to disarm. Visit by Chief of Staff **********Today Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, the new Chief of Staff of the armed forces, made a brief visit to Negros, another island where the insurgents have been most active. He urged civilians to speak to the rebels about accepting an amnesty. **********''We must learn to work together not as rivals but as good neighbors,'' said the general, who was protected by 150 troops. **********Catholic nuns and clergy members have gone to distant rebel areas in unofficial attempts to promote a cease-fire. They contend that the guerrillas might not grasp the full significance of the overthrow of Mr. Marcos and the rise of President Aquino. **********The worst encounter reported recently occurred Sunday in Cagayan Province, where 23 people, 15 of them rebels, were killed after 100 insurgents attacked a Government food warehouse, according to The Associated Press."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/14/world/many-faces-of-qaddafi-showman-and-survivor.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Miller", "pub_date": "1986-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1994, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MANY FACES OF QADDAFI: SHOWMAN AND SURVIVOR", "print_headline": "MANY FACES OF QADDAFI: SHOWMAN AND SURVIVOR", "body_text": " **********Earlier this year Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya tried to convince the West that he was not a terrorist. **********He invited five female correspondents to meet his wife, Safiya, and their seven children inside a Bedouin tent permanently pitched inside the heavily fortified Bab el-Azziziya military barracks in Tripoli. **********For more than two hours Colonel Qaddafi portrayed the role of devoted husband, loving father and beneficent leader of his country's 3.5 million people. He spoke about his personal life, his hopes and dreams, his desire for peace and his respect for the American people. **********''They think I don't laugh or smile or tell jokes,'' Colonel Qaddafi said. ''They think I only hate.'' ''But you can see that the image Reagan has of me is not true,'' he said, stroking the hair of his only natural daughter, Aisha, age 8. ''I invite you to tell the world.'' **********The colonel might have carried off the family scene convincingly had another invitation not been issued outside the tent. **********After the interview, the reporters were escorted to a nearby office building to join Colonel Qaddafi for tea. One by one, three of the five women were invited in succession into a tiny room containing only a bed and a television set. There, Colonel Qaddafi made an abrupt sexual advance at each of them and was rebuffed. **********Since coming to power in 1969, Colonel Qaddafi has tried, through interviews and news conferences, to portray himself as an incorruptible, ascetic leader. Many newspaper articles have described him as a devout Moslem who neither drinks nor smokes and a devoted family man. But Libyans close to the leader know that the family-man image, like so much in Colonel Qaddafi's Libya, is political veneer. Durable and Unpredictable **********Colonel Qaddafi is a masterful showman of political theater who has demonstrated an almost astonishing capacity for focusing world attention on his vast, underpopulated land. But he is also a ruthless and cunning politician whose skills have frequently been underestimated by opponents. **********Time and again Colonel Qaddafi, whom this reporter last saw in late February, has proven himself a survivor. At 44 years of age he is one of the Arab world's most durable, if youngest, leaders. **********He is also one of the world's most erratic. The colonel demonstrated this on Wednesday, when he failed to appear as promised before 40 journalists summoned to Libya from various parts of the world to attend what had been promoted as a major speech marking the 16th anniversary of the expulsion of the United States from Wheelus Air Base in Tripoli. Instead, the colonel delivered a rambling attack against the United States on television. He appeared tired, confused and disoriented, television viewers said. **********Despite such celebrated unpredictability, Colonel Qaddafi, in the name of Islam and an eccentric ideology that he calls the ''Third International Theory,'' has transformed the traditional, Bedouin-dominated former Italian colony into a police state, a society as arid and lifeless as its desert environs. Thirty thousand of its best-educated citizens have fled Libya. **********Colonel Qaddafi's revolution and his stewardship of his countryhave brought education and economic development for many Libyans. But it has also brought repression, fear, and, according to diplomats, political killings at home, assassinations and terrorist attacks abroad. **********Only four of the 12 junior officers who toppled King Idris in a coup and seized power with him in 1969 have survived. The others, and numerous ''stray dogs,'' as the colonel has called critics who have sought sanctuary abroad, have been gunned down or poisoned in European capitals, even in the United States. Law enforcement officials attribute these attacks to Libyans enrolled as students, and to diplomats who followed faithfully the colonel's instructions to ''crush stray dogs like cats.'' **********Despite such extreme efforts to quell opposition, the colonel appears to have become increasingly frustrated with his people's stubborn resistance to his radical notions and eccentric vision of Islamic utopia. He has succeeded in inculcating his revolutionary creed primarily among the young. As such, the so-called revolutionary committee guards he has created have become a major pillar of his regime. They are composed of teen-agers who carry Soviet-made assault rifles, spy on their friends and families and are despised by many Libyans. Army Is Unhappy **********The army, angered by the growing influence of such paramilitary groups, is unhappy, Colonel Qaddafi has acknowledged. Its members do not relish the prospect of being replaced by ''armed masses,'' as Colonel Qaddafi has ordained. **********And his people, Colonel Qaddafi complains, are lazy. But he attributes this idleness to the inherent character of ''petroleum societies,'' not to a form of silent protest of his regime, as some diplomats believe it to be. **********The frustration is apparent on the colonel's face. Gone are the soft smile and wide-eyed enthusiasm discernible in photographs of him soon after the coup. He is still enormously photogenic and charismatic before the cameras. But up close his smile seems forced. The corners of his lips turn down. A scowl comes more readily than the smile he occasionally dons for visiting reporters. His face is deeply lined. His eyes are small, piercing, cold. **********During a recent interview, he repeatedly stared at his television set, which he keeps on constantly without sound, as he watched one of an endless series of ''people's assemblies'' in which Libyans were chanting and waving their fists in anger at the United States. **********''Look at them,'' he said, motioning to the podium where young Libyans were orchestrating the cheering. ''They are all wearing vests. That's because I wore a vest yesterday. Whenever I wear something, the whole country winds up wearing it,'' he sighed. Visage Is Everywhere **********Although he says he despises personality cults and has ordered Libyan television and the newspapers not to show pictures of him, the colonel's visage is omnipresent in Tripoli. His photograph adorns almost every street and every shop. Shop owners who did not display his portrait were ordered at gunpoint by revolutionary guards to show it. Libyan stores offer a dozen photos of the colonel in various postures, as well as dozens of postcards of the colonel in daily activities - at prayer, at play and with his family, riding horseback, one of his favorite hobbies. **********Colonel Qaddafi's appearance undergoes drastic changes depending on his mood. In interviews earlier this year, for example, he appeared before reporters clean-shaven, meticulously attired and relaxed. He looked his 44 years. Later, in February, however, he appeared unshaven and shoddily dressed. Dark circles encased his eyes. When this reporter was summoned one night to the Bab el-Azziziya barracks, he looked as if he had not slept for days. His face was severely swollen. **********In fact, Libyans say, he sleeps little, and almost never in the same place two nights in a row. ''He has become like Yasir Arafat, constantly in motion and terrified of being killed,'' an Arab diplomat said, comparing the colonel to the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********To some extent, his fear is justified. Thanks to security provided by East German advisers, he has escaped at least seven assassination attempts in recent years, according to diplomats. The most serious is said to have occurred in May 1984, when 12 men attacked the Bab el-Azziziya barracks and were killed in the effort. **********The colonel's revolutionary committee members arrested some 2,000 Libyans suspected of involvement in the plot and blew up an apartment building and its 250 inhabitants after some of the attackers sought shelter there. **********Colonel Qaddafi's frequent and dramatic shifts in mood and the sharp changes in his physical appearance have led some diplomats to conclude that he is either ill or taking drugs such as antidepressants or cortisone, which alters a person's appearance. One intelligence analyst who has followed Colonel Qaddafi closely says the colonel has received secret medical treatment for an undisclosed ailment in the Soviet Union, at a Swiss clinic, in Egypt and in France. Persistence Toward Goals **********Despite his unpredictable behavior, Colonel Qaddafi has pursued his grand political visions with persistence and consistency. Born in the desert town of Sidra, he was raised in a tent and went to school only for a few years. Self-taught, he professes to have steeped himself in the writings of Jefferson, Lincoln, Marx, Lenin and his hero Mao Zedong, whose ''little red book'' was a model for Colonel Qaddafi's Green Books, the three slender volumes in which he outlines his idiosyncratic political theories. **********He learned English, which he speaks fairly well when he wants to and is relaxed, in Tripoli and in Wilton, England, where he was a junior officer assigned to a staff course in communications in 1966. He disliked Britain, some friends say, and found the English cold and condescending. **********He adored Gamal Abdel Nasser, the late President of Egypt, and since coming to power has vigorously sought to carry out Nasser's vision of a united Arab world that would confront the West and Israel. **********Colonel Qaddafi has forged or proposed unity agreements with Arab and African neighbors, and even with China, which gracefully declined. Only Morocco has a functioning unity accord with Libya now; most of his other Arab neighbors, targets of assassination attempts blamed on Colonel Qaddafi or of Libyan efforts to destabilize their Governments, scorn but fear him. **********The colonel's attitude toward the United States is more complex, bordering on what might be described as love-hate. Despite his professed admiration for American ingenuity and technology, he has expressed hatred for the United States for its support of Israel and has tried to kill American officials and Americans abroad for years, according to diplomats. **********In the late 1970's and early 1980's, his support for revolutionaries and a wide variety of terrorists became more overt. American officials say, and diplomats confirm, that Libya has provided training sites, weapons, money, diplomatic cover, passports and other logistical support to a wide variety of groups - the Irish Republican Army, the Red Brigades of Italy, Direct Action of France, dozens of Arab terrorist mercenary groups, the P.L.O. and radical Palestinian factions and Latin American insurgents. **********While the anti-American and anti-Israeli terrorist attacks in Europe and the Middle East to which he has been linked have attracted much public attention, his growing influence in Africa has worried European political analysts far more. His latest target is the Sudan, where he has spent more than $20 million buying influence in the wake of the coup last year in the Sudan, and has given money to virtually every political faction, according to Western officials. Effects of Raid Debated **********In the six months that preceded the American air raids last April, American officials say, Colonel Qaddafi stepped up his public taunts of the United States and quietly issued orders, which were intercepted by American intelligence, to Libyan embassies throughout Europe for more terrorist attacks against American targets. It was this escalation of terror that led the Reagan Administration to take stronger action against Libya, the American sources said. **********The effect of the American economic and military attacks on him are still being debated. But recent visitors to Libya concur that the American raid has badly shaken the colonel and intensified opposition to his rule, particularly in the crucial military sector. **********One indicator is that the colonel, who once loved to have flamboyant confrontations with American journalists, has not met face to face with them since the attack. American officials hope that Colonel Qaddafi's ultimate vulnerability will have been exposed, along with the unreliability of his Soviet ally and the equipment it has supplied. **********The great survivor, these officials say, is now being put to his toughest test."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/08/business/advertising-print-for-frye-boots.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1986-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Print for Frye Boots", "print_headline": "Advertising; Print for Frye Boots", "body_text": " **********Frye Boots, the 123-year-old shoe manufacturer, will initiate its first consumer print campaign since Stanley Kravetz bought the company from Alberto-Culver last July.

Also this week, the Albritton Communications Company, Washington, said it had formed a unit, the Allco Corporation, to purchase network affiliate stations. **********Mr. Erlicht said yesterday that according to the way he and Mr. Bennett read the market, the next three or four years will offer good opportunities to buy stations at fair prices after several years in which some people overpaid for them. **********''It's a cyclical business,'' he said. ''In the next three years we are estimating a soft marketplace in terms of ad revenues. That has happened before. It's happened five times or so in the last 15 years.'' **********Those who overpaid for stations are in trouble when ad revenues drop because they must pay debt service along with fixed costs, Mr. Erlicht said. For example, he said, say a station produced cash flow of $15 million annually and the owner paid $150 million for it, $100 million borrowed at 12 percent. The debt service would be $12 million a year. When a soft period comes along and revenues diminish to, say, $11 million, the owner will either have to refinance ''or be a little creative.'' **********''The people who bought at the right price will have a diminishing profit but will be able to overcome it and hang on until the situation turns around,'' he said. **********Mr. Bennett, 59, and Mr. Erlicht, 47, both started in broadcast sales.

A consensus emerged, based on hindsight and injured regional pride, that an Eastern drive for overnight success somehow led the Western airline to its doom. **********''Our biggest mistake was being purchased by People Express,'' said Mike Daciek, a Frontier captain. ''Here's this overnight wonder from New Jersey with a no-frills operation trying to operate an airline that has given high-quality service for 42 years. It was bound to fail.'' **********First officer Don Riebe agreed. ''There's a difference between here and back East,'' he said. ''People there are more used to that rough treatment that you get from no frills. But when they tried it at Frontier, we lost all our customers.'' Chance of Being Hired **********Mr. Riebe is 39 years old and figures he has a chance of being taken on by another carrier, but Mr. Daciek, at 53, holds out little hope. **********''I've only got seven years to go before I'm 60, and I doubt very seriously if anyone at United or Northwest or any of the majors is going to be interested in hiring me,'' he said. **********There was also a sense of wounded regional pride. ''It was almost bizarre to think that Frontier, once headquartered in Denver with its honest and proud record of regional service and community interest in the towns of its routes, could stay the same airline while it was ruled by some corporate sharks in Newark,'' a columnist for The Denver Post wrote today. **********The comment reflected a widespread view that the Newark-based People Express Inc., Frontier's parent, mismanaged the airline, particularly by changing it from full service to no frills. **********Continental Airlines, meanwhile, opened an employment booth at Stapleton for Frontier workers, where it has been taking applications all week. It also is allowing many Frontier workers to fly Continental free while they look for jobs elsewhere. **********United Air Lines said it, too, would open a job applications center near Stapleton for the displaced workers. Jobs Hard to Get **********While some unskilled jobs are readily transferable between airlines, the cockpit seats will be harder to get on other airlines, according to Frontier pilots. Flight deck positions are strictly controlled by seniority, several pointed out, so that a Frontier captain who made $68,000 a year could have to start over as a flight engineer at less than $20,000 a year. **********Rather than settle for such a cut, several senior pilots said they would try to get jobs with unscheduled carriers, such as charter companies and air freight operators. **********Besides People Express, there were other targets of criticism for Frontier workers today. United was criticized for its refusal to buy Frontier for $146 million, as negotiated with People Express. **********United pilots came under fire for blocking their company's attempt to bring Frontier's pilots in at a lower pay scale. The United pilots had feared downward pressure on their own salaries. And Federal deregulators were chastized for opening up the Denver market to price cutting by United and Continental, the city's two remaining hub operators, ''Deregulation is fine where there are lots of cities close to each other,'' said Dale Smith, a ticketing agent who moved to Denver from Pennsylvania. ''But out here where you don't have those big markets, it just means the big guys eat up the little guys. Like us.'' Unemployment Impact **********Meanwhile, Colorado planners estimate that losing Frontier may raise Denver's unemployment rate a full point, from 5.5 percent, to 6.5 percent, The increase would come at a time when the city is already suffering from a weakened high-technology industry and hurt by a depresssed energy industry. **********The bankruptcy may also hurt some Denver companies, such as Sky Chef Inc., the food caterers. **********Along with job worries and resentments, Frontier's personnel were also nostalgic today. They remembered a local company that got its start flying to Albuquerque, N.M., and Salt Lake City with surplus World War II DC-3's, and whose working atmosphere seemed to many to be like a big family."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/09/business/ford-job-cuts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford Job Cuts", "print_headline": "Ford Job Cuts", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company said it planned to eliminate up to 25 percent of its salaried automotive employees in North America by 1990, which would affect up to 13,000 jobs, company officials said.

But the value of itemized tax deductions will fall correspondingly. As a result, the deductions taken by most people, such as those for mortgage interest, real estate taxes and state and local income taxes, as well as the more esoteric tax shelters, will not be worth as much as before. **********''With prospects of deductions being worth less next year,'' said Leon M. Nad, associate vice chairman of Price Waterhouse, ''you really have to look ahead. This year may be the last train to Madrid.'' **********David S. Rhine, a partner of the certified public accounting firm of Seidman & Seidman/BDO, said the amount of tax planning that should be done now ''depends on whether you are betting for or against the bill.'' He added, ''If you are betting for it, there will be a lot of tightening - and the guy who doesn't respond to the tightening by aggressive tax planning is going to be hard pressed.'' **********Deductions that may be worth more this year than next might be accelerated, the tax planners say. That encompasses prepayment, where possible, of state and local income taxes, charitable contributions and charges for investment advisory services or investment publications. In addition, payments for items that would completely lose their deductibility next year, such as union dues, might also be paid this year if possible. **********On the income side, the traditional technique of deferral until the following year would largely be inappropriate, because tax rates may be lower in 1987. However, since the long-term capital gains rate would increase under the committee plan from the current 20 percent maximum to 27 percent, it may be worthwhile in some cases, barring any transition provisions, to take profits on securities before the end of 1986. **********Some securities that might be significantly affected are municipal bonds and municipal bond funds and trusts, since the value of their tax exemptions will be reduced by almost half under the Finance Committee plan. The prices of existing municipals may be discounted in order to achieve the same effective taxable interest rate, while future issues may be sold at a higher rate for the same reason. **********As for tax shelters, riskier deals may have to be structured by sponsors in future years, in order for investors to receive the same tax breaks. Under current law, a shelter can pay for itself in tax benefits for a top bracket individual with a 2-to-1 write-off. Under the committee proposals, it would take a 3.7-to-1 write-off to achieve the same results. **********In analyzing the consequences of the anticipated lower value of tax deductions, a number of factors should be considered. For instance, while certain restrictions, including the repeal of the deduction for state and local sales taxes and for miscellaneous itemized deductions, would take effect on Jan. 1, 1987, the lower tax brackets do not become effective until July 1, 1987. So accelerating deductions would not have the same value as it would if all provisions of the bill were to take effect in January. **********In addition, although there will be only two tax rates, the 15 percent bracket and dependents' exemption are phased out for upper-income taxpayers in such a way that the rate on every additional dollar earned - the so-called marginal tax rate -will be higher than 27 percent. But no taxpayer would ever be taxed more than 27 percent of total taxable income. **********Finally, the impact of the greater capital gains rate would be even more severe for those in states with high personal income taxes. ''It's getting close to doubling the net tax cost of a capital gain,'' noted David A. Berenson, a partner of Ernst & Whinney. ''There will be a substantial decrease in in-pocket cash resulting from any type of capital gain transaction.'' **********Mr. Berenson gave this example of the combined capital gains tax paid by a person in the top tax bracket to the Federal Government and to a state with a maximum rate of 10 percent. At present, the Federal rate is 20 percent and the after-tax state rate is effectively 2 percent for a total of 22 percent. The Finance Committee proposal would not only raise the Federal rate to 27 percent, but also increase the state tax cost to 7.3 percent, for a total of 34.3 percent. **********Here is how this works: At present, the top-bracket taxpayer with a capital gain of $1,000 would pay a tax of $200, because only 40 percent of the gain, or $400, is taxable and the highest rate is 50 percent. The 10 percent state tax rate is computed on the $400 used for Federal calculations.

Marcos has run into problems that were not foreseen when he called the election three months ago. **********This is not to say the analysts think Mr. Marcos will lose. But whatever the outcome of the election on Feb. 7, they say, the President appears to be paying a political price in terms of loss of prestige. **********There is even a growing feeling among Filipinos that Mr. Marcos, whose political acumen was once thought to be faultless, made a mistake when he called the elections. However, the President's admirers still have faith that the ultimate outcome will vindicate his reputation for tactical farsightedness. Marcos Still Fighting Aquino Among other things, he appears to be still contending with his political rival, Benigno S. Aquino Jr., who was assassinated in 1983. Although Mr. Aquino's widow, Corazon, is opposing Mr. Marcos in the election, it is the spirit of her slain husband, as much as any political program on which she has based her appeal, that has been attracting large crowds. **********In calling for the elections 16 months before his term was due to expire in 1987, Mr. Marcos has set in motion a series of events that has succeeded in uniting the opposition groups. **********According to reports from Washington, there is a new consensus in the Reagan Administration that Mr. Marcos's departure from office would be in the best interests of the Philippines if it is to fend off a Communist insurrection. **********Other reports from Washington that Army records do not support Mr. Marcos's contention of having played a key guerrilla role during the Japanese occupation in World War II have put him on the political defensive. **********Today, the Roman Catholic Church, whose voice carries authority in this nation, issued a pastoral letter whose careful language seemed to indicate that the church was sympathetic to Mrs. Aquino's campaign positions. Church Sees Signs of Fraud The letter, issued by the Catholic bishops' conference, said the church had detected signs of fraud and violence similar to the pattern of past elections. Much of the document was couched in the terms being used by the political opposition. **********The pastoral letter will be read at nine masses and may partly offset Mrs. Aquino's lack of equal access to radio, television and newspapers. **********Church support may give Mrs. Aquino a much-needed organizational base acting as a counterbalance to the President's superior political organization. **********Mrs. Aquino has said that the tide of national will is with her and that a Marcos victory would be a stolen victory. She has said that if she loses she will organize protest demonstrations. **********Mr. Marcos has left his options open, saying at one point that he may declare martial law and call off the vote if violence breaks out. **********Asked at a recent news conference what he might do if he lost the election, he said, ''Both sides plan certain options.'' At another time, he said he might not leave office if the vote was accompanied by violence. Cancellation Would Be Defeat Any cancellation of the election or distortion of its outcome would most likely be seen as a defeat for the President, an act of a man unwilling to accept the voice of the electorate. **********Mr. Marcos is viewed with something like awe in the Philippines as the canniest politician in the land, a man who has easily kept his opponents at bay for 20 years. Even Mrs. Aquino calls him ''the most brilliant Filipino.'' **********But some politicians are intrigued by the notion that Mr. Marcos has been making mistakes, the greatest of which may have been the calling of the election itself. **********He says he called the vote to lay to rest growing questions about his popular mandate. Other analysts say he did so to slip out from under American pressure for changes in his policies. **********Another factor may be that he hoped, by announcing an election, to dull the impact of the acquittal of 26 people accused of involvement in the murder of Mr. Aquino. **********''Throughout his career, Aquino was the only person who could upset Marcos's political coolness,'' said a Filipino journalist. Two of Brightest Politicians The two men were the brightest young politicians in the mid-1960's, and Mr. Aquino was seen as the most likely successor to Mr. Marcos when his second and final term of presidency was to end in 1973. **********Mr. Marcos declared martial law and jailed Mr. Aquino in 1972. In 1981 he allowed him to travel to the United States for heart surgery. Both moves, which were seen as attempts to silence his opponent, only succeeded in giving Mr. Aquino new platforms for his criticisms. **********It was Mr. Aquino's death that set off the national crisis, leading ultimately to the calling of this election. **********During the first part of the campaign, Mr. Marcos attacked the memory of his former rival, saying that he was a founder of the Communist Party. **********On Monday, unable to rid himself of the Aquino ghost, the President tried a new tack, insisting that he was Mr. Aquino's friend and implying that it is in fact he, Mr. Marcos, who will carry on the Aquino legacy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/08/world/violence-erupts-at-a-demonstration-in-haiti.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 587, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VIOLENCE ERUPTS AT A DEMONSTRATION IN HAITI", "print_headline": "VIOLENCE ERUPTS AT A DEMONSTRATION IN HAITI", "body_text": " **********An anti-Government demonstration involving thousands of protesters erupted in violence this afternoon with one policeman reported killed and at least six other people wounded. **********After a peaceful march through the capital earlier today, gunfire and rock-throwing broke out as people gathered for a second march in mid-afternoon.

Castle resigned yesterday as chief executive of the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. **********Donaldson, Lufkin, the brokerage subsidiary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, said that Mr. Castle, who is 45 years old, had decided to form his own firm, which would engage in venture capital, leveraged buyouts and other specialized equity investments. It gave no other reason for the abruptness of his resignation, which it said is effective immediately. **********John S. Chalsty, who is 53 and currently chairman of the firm's capital markets group, will replace Mr. Castle. Mr. Chalsty is a native of South Africa who became acquainted with the firm's three founders as their classmate at the Harvard Business School in the late 1950's. **********Discord Denied **********The announcement startled securities executives both inside and outside the firm and raised speculation that the sudden move resulted from discord in the executive suite. Mr. Castle denied this, however, saying that he had been contemplating the move for some time. **********The firm's third quarter is likely to be the most profitable in Donaldson, Lufkin's history, he said, and overall earnings are likely to double this year over 1985. He would not provide figures, however, since the firm is a subsidiary of Equitable, which acquired it in 1984 for $432 million. **********''My heart has for a long time been in private forms of investment,'' said Mr. Castle, who has been at the firm for 21 years. He added that he would remain at the firm for just a few more days. ''I am of the mind that when you stop doing something, you give the mantle to the new people and let them do it,'' he commented. Investment, Operating Strengths **********Mr. Castle is generally held in high regard for his investment and operating acumen. One of his earlier jobs at the brokerage house was as head of its venture capital business, where he racked up a strong record, and many regard him as having been an effective cost-cutter. Mr. Castle joined the firm in 1965 as an electrical equipment industry analyst but soon moved on to venture capital. He became president and chief operating officer in 1979 and and chief executive in early 1985. **********Mr. Castle said he finally made up his mind to leave the firm during a recent four-week tour of China, Tibet and Mongolia with a group of doctors. After returning to New York several weeks ago, he waited for Richard H. Jenrette, a founder of the firm and now vice chairman of Equitable, and Leo M. Walsh Jr., Equitable's chief operating officer, to return from their own vacations to inform them of his decision. **********''Some of us had the feeling that this was on his mind for some time,'' Mr. Chalsty said. ''You should not assume that this reflects anything negative about the firm. We're having a terrific year and we're solidly in the black in all of our businesses. The honest and easy answer here is that what you see is what you get. There is nothing mysterious at all.'' No 'Dramatic Changes' Seen **********Mr. Chalsty added that he foresaw few, if any, major changes in the firm's current direction. ''Of course, everyone has a slight difference in style,'' he remarked. ''But I suspect you won't see any dramatic changes.'' **********Mr. Castle has a reputation of appearing uncomfortable in social situations and being an occasionally abrasive manager of people. **********''He's done a very good job as far as profitability there,'' said Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation. ''He's been a real stickler for costs and was instrumental in improving their margins. But he wasn't a people manager at all.'' **********Several Wall Street executives recalled the evening several years ago when Mr. Castle was inducted into Kappa Beta Phi, a loosely knit Wall Street social fraternity. At the annual black tie dinner there is often good-natured hazing of incoming members, but Mr. Castle stormed out when his ribbing began, several Wall Street sources said. Style of Successor **********Mr. Chalsty is regarded as being a smoother manager of people than Mr. Castle. ''I do have an ability to work well with people,'' he commented. **********Mr. Chalsty, who became a United States citizen in 1964, worked for Exxon for 12 years after leaving Harvard and then was recruited as an oil industry analyst by Mr. Jenrette. He ran the firm's research department from 1972 to 1978, when he took over its investment banking department. He was named chairman of its capital markets division in January 1984.

It is a city sinking into its soft-clay base at a rate of almost four inches a year, officials say. Most of it will soon be below sea level. It is a city whose storied canals are now ecologically dead, polluted by organic and chemical waste. **********But Bangkok is also struggling with an unseen problem that makes life hard for its Western-educated planners: how to put a brake on unbridled, environmentally damaging development in a society that instinctively shrinks from confrontation and rejects harsh measures. **********''This is a soft-culture country,'' said Anat Arbhabhirama, president of the Thailand Research Development Institute, who is an adviser to the Prime Minister on economic and technological matters. ''Thai people normally solve problems by consensus. We cannot force solutions.'' **********Mr. Anat was responding to the kind of questions he has come to expect from Western reporters: Why are there not stiffer penalties to stop the illegal pumping of ground water? Why are industrial polluters not prosecuted more zealously? Why is there no militant environmentalist movement fighting for the people whose drinking water is contaminated and whose homes are perennially threatened by floods? **********Reporters for the lively Bangkok press write that ''doing things the Thai way'' comes up in debates over why embarrassing corruption cases are dropped, why helmets cannot be required of motorcyclists - who are involved in one out of five traffic deaths - or whether the planners of coups should be allowed closed trials, or amnesties even. **********But where water is concerned, says Tawatchai Tingsanchali, chairman of the Water Resources Department of the Thailand-based Asian Institute of Technology, there may have to be a limit to cultural forbearance. **********''We cannot wait for consensus,'' said Mr. Tawatchai, who has conducted many studies on water control and usage. ''There are some times we have to force decisions. But we should also remember that our soft culture is soft in every way.'' He added: ''That means people can be easily taught. The understanding of the situation is already better because of education.'' **********Bangkok's water problems are formidable, say Mr. Tawachat and Mr. Anat, who has a master's degree in hydraulic engineering from the Asian Institute and a Ph.D. in civil engineering from Colorado State University. **********The city, Mr. Anat said, cannot afford a central water treatment plant. It cannot stop the sinking of wells for new housing projects, hotels and office complexes, because Bangkok itself does not have the resources to supply water services. **********''Since Bangkok is at the mouth of a river, it doesn't have much land above mean sea level,'' Mr. Anat said. ''But as time goes on, floods here get worse. Over the years land subsidence has made the effects of heavy rain more serious. **********''Canals have been filled, legally and illegally. Natural swamp areas have been reduced by development, so there is nowhere for the water to go.'' **********Tides have also become a greater concern. The Chao Phraya River, which flows back and forth through the heart of the city on the tide, serves the useful function of flushing much of the polluted water into the Gulf of Thailand as it rises and falls. Fish and plants still live in the Chao Phraya. **********But subsidence makes tides higher, bringing not only more floodwater but also increased salinity on truck farming and orchards land. **********Meanwhile, the city continues to grow. Mr. Anat foresees the time when there will not be enough water to drink, but too much in the streets. **********''Should Bangkok be in this place at all?'' Mr. Anat mused. ''Two hundred years ago, when the city was founded, I would have said yes. Then, 90 percent of the people were rural, and Bangkok was one of the best rice paddy areas in Thailand. Canals were used for transport. This was the best location for a new capital. **********''But now I would have to say no.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/16/business/finance-new-issues-denver-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Denver Offering", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Denver Offering", "body_text": " **********Denver is offering $160.4 million of general obligation water refunding bonds through underwriters led by Bankers Trust. **********Yields on the issue range from 4.75 percent for bonds due in 1988 to 5.50 percent in 1991, 6.50 percent in 1996, 7 percent in 2001 and 7.25 percent in 2006.

And now three soldiers are dead after an accident during maneuvers. **********These events have combined to focus attention on the Italian military this summer and to produce a growing number of proposals for change. **********Returning to work after the August holidays, leaders of Italy's two largest political parties, the Christian Democrats and the Communists, issued calls this week for urgent legislative action. **********Senator Ugo Pecchioli, the Communist floor leader in the upper house of Parliament, said Tuesday that recent events showed the condition of the military was ''of undoubtable seriousness.'' Dinner on Sundays **********In order to make the year of military service required of most Italian men more attractive, the Christian Democrats have proposed that conscripts spend a few months serving with other NATO forces so that they can learn a foreign language. Defense Minister Giovanni Spadolini has suggested that parents be allowed to join their sons in the barracks for the traditional family dinner on Sunday afternoons. **********Public attention began focusing on the state of the military after several young conscripts committed suicide in barracks around the country. At least six of these deaths have been registered this year, and different causes have been cited in each case. Some of the suicides have been attributed to the boredom of barracks life, and others appear to have come in reaction to bullying by older troops. **********In August, at least two courts-martial were started in response to episodes of violent hazing in the barracks. In one of the cases, two enlisted men were accused of pouring melted boot wax into the ear of a young recruit. In the other case, six conscripts, only one day short of completing their terms, were accused of demanding that a new draftee pay them the equivalent of just under a dollar every night. Otherwise, they threatened to awaken him repeatedly all night. **********These incidents have provoked public concern because an outpouring of interviews by soldiers and protesting letters from parents showed that ''nonnismo,'' as violent hazing in the barracks is known, was almost an everyday occurrence. Loyalty to NATO **********Italian Governments have loyally fulfilled their NATO commitments over the years, and there were far fewer protests here than in West Germany or Britain over the decision to go along with the modernization of NATO's medium-range missile force. **********Public-opinion polls, however, consistently show that many Italians deeply question the need to maintain a modern military force because no direct threat is perceived. **********More than two-thirds of the 250,000 men in the Italian Army are poorly paid conscripts who are generally housed in old, badly equipped barracks and are given little training. Efforts to improve this situation have been hampered by military spending that is one of the lowest among the NATO countries. **********Protests by parents' groups and some politicians increased after an episode at a barracks near Padua on Aug. 12. **********Gen. Franco Bosio admitted before a military court on Monday that during an address to his brigade he had used an epithet in referring to soldiers who vandalized locker rooms. Also on Monday, three soldiers were killed and five were hurt when an armored personnel carrier overturned during an exercise near Trieste. **********Mr. Spadolini went to the site of the accident on Tuesday and expressed his sympathy for the dead. **********The Communists and other left-wing parties insist that conscription is essential to preserve the democratic nature of the armed forces.

''He has a checkered past and a lot of multiple passports,'' the diplomat said. **********Link to Syria Reported **********According to an unconfirmed report, Mr. Mansour's brother had links to the pro-Syrian Baath Party in Jordan, a connection that pointed toward Syria rather than Libya, which the United States has blamed for being behind the attack in West Berlin.  [ In Rome, the Italian authorities announced that a Libyan diplomat had been arrested on suspicion of plotting at least a year ago to kill the American, Saudi and Egyptian Ambassadors to Italy. Page A8. ]  The Reagan Administration, citing intercepted communications, has charged that the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin organized the bombing of the discotheque on April 5, in which an American soldier and a Turkish woman were killed and 230 other people wounded. The Administration cited the attack in justifying the American air stikes against Tripoli and Benghazi a week ago. **********At a news conference today, Michael-Andreas Butz, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said investigators could not rule out a connection between Libya and the man arrested in West Berlin. He cautioned against what he called ''premature announcements of success'' in the case. The sources supplied little information about Mr. Mansour except to say that he had lived in West Berlin for some time. The western side of the divided city has a large floating population of Arabs and others from the third world, many of them drawn there by its open frontier and West Germany's generous political asylum laws. **********Despite the scarcity of information immediately available about Mr. Mansour, the Jordanian editor of the London-based newspaper Al Arab said in a telephone interview that the man described as the brother, Mr. Hindawi, had worked briefly for the daily newspaper four and a half years ago. A Clan From Jordan **********The editor, Mohammed Kabarday, said that the Hindawi clan of Jordan came from the Houran border area near the Syrian frontier and that several of its members had become politically prominent in Jordan. Others who knew Mr. Hindawi on the newspaper said he had been a member of the pro-Syrian wing of the pan-Arab Baath Party. **********Rival wings of the Baath Party rule Syria and Iraq, and the party's founder, Michel Aflaq, now lives in Baghdad. Before it was banned in 1958 in Jordan the party had a considerable following in the country, although most of its adherents inclined to what became the pro-Iraqi wing. **********After the explosion in West Berlin, West German intelligence officers linked the attack to the Libyan mission in East Berlin but said the actual attackers had been Palestinians. Today some news reports, evidently incorrectly, described the man arrested in West Berlin as ''a stateless Palestinian.'' Man Is Formally Charged **********In London, Mr. Hindawi was formally charged today with conspiring to kill his pregnant Irish friend, Anne-Marie Murphy, by placing a bomb in her luggage. The bomb was found by airline security agents when the woman tried to board the El Al Israel Airlines plane at Heathrow Airport. **********Mr. Hindawi was also accused of conspiring with unidentified people to murder others who would have been killed if the plane had taken off with the bomb aboard. **********The British authorities were reported to be continuing their interrogation of another Arab man about the El Al episode. A third man arrested today in the case was freed without charges. **********Scotland Yard also said the police seized documents related to the bomb plot in a raid over the weekend on a house in West London, heightening speculation that an Arab terrorist cell was behind the attempted sabotage of the El Al jetliner. Documents Aren't Described **********A Scotland Yard spokesman declined to describe the documents. He also refused to comment on a report Monday in The Standard, an evening newspaper, that the house was rented by two or three Arab men and was a terrorist cell's hide-out. **********The Press Association, quoted by The Associated Press, said detectives believed that the explosives used in the foiled sabotage came from the Eastern Europe, but not the Soviet Union. **********According to the agency report, which quoted police sources it did not identify, investigators have not ruled out the possibility that an Eastern-bloc country supplied the explosives to Libya or Syria. **********On Saturday night the British police arrested the second man in the El Al case and, according to some accounts, he was Mahmoud Hindawi, another brother, who worked in the medical department of the Qatar Embassy in London. The third man was also reported to have been arrested today in Britain, but no details on his identity were revealed before he was released."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/16/business/company-briefs-487786.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Standard Inc. said it had signed a letter of intent for the sale of its Modernfold division to a new corporation to be formed by Wesray Capital Corp.

Denmark called Moscow's delay in admitting the accident ''totally unacceptable,'' and Sweden warned that Moscow's failure to disclose details of the accident could set back future relations between the two countries. **********But Finland, which along with Sweden absorbed the highest doses of radiation in the Nordic region, was silent. The official explanation is that such reticence is a matter of diplomatic style. **********''In situations like this, we are not the first to criticize,'' said Jouni Lilja, a Foreign Ministry spokesman. ''We try to take a constructive approach.'' **********The desire to maintain a diplomatic silence is particularly strong when the Soviet Union is involved. For Finland, national survival and economic prosperity depend on living in harmony with its giant Communist neighbor. A Deeply Ingrained Policy **********Finland's official silence over the Soviet accident is but the most recent evidence of its national policy of studiously avoiding any words or acts that might antagonize Moscow. When the Russians went into Afghanistan in 1979 or occupied Czechoslovakia in 1968, there were no protests from Helsinki. And Soviet dissidents are encouraged to use other borders as escape routes. **********Some Western commentators have attacked Finland for tailoring its foreign policy to Russian sensitivities and the term ''Finlandization'' denotes a submission to domination by a powerful neighbor. Finns reply that their policy is the pragmatic accommodation of a small, neutral nation - a postwar arrangement reached after difficult and often bloody relations between Finland and the Soviet Union. **********Diplomatic silence, they argue, is a small price to pay for remaining a capitalist, democratic and independent nation. Finland plays down its foreign policy differences with the Soviet Union but maintains ''the ideological gulf'' that divides the two countries, according to Max Jakobson, Helsinki's former chief representative at the United Nations. From Conquest to Friendship **********Finland historical relationship with its neighbor to the east is long and stormy. In 1809, Finland was conquered by Alexander I and remained an autonomous duchy of the Russian Empire until the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. Then Lenin granted Finland its independence. But a year later he changed his mind, sponsoring a civil war in which Soviet-backed ''reds'' were eventually defeated by ''whites'' aided by the German Army. **********In World War II, Finland twice fought the Soviet Union in territorial disputes, first in the Winter War of 1939-40 and then in the Continuation War of 1941-44. Afterward, Finland was forced to pay the Soviet Union about $570 million in war reparations. And in 1948 the two nations signed their Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, under which Finland promised to never allow a foreign nation to use Finnish territory for aggression against the Soviet Union. **********For Finland, the economic benefits of harmony have been considerable. Under a series of five-year trade agreements, Finland has a guaranteed market in the Soviet Union. It sells ships, industrial and consumer goods to the Russians while purchasing mostly Soviet oil and natural gas. The pacts stipulate that the two-way trade must balance. Finns Value Trade Links **********Accordingly, the Soviet Union is Finland's largest trading partner. The Russians buy about one-fifth of Finland's exports, giving the Finnish economy a ''red cushion'' that has helped it to grow at a steady annual rate of 3 percent for the past decade. **********Finns bridle at the suggestion that their country has ''sold out'' to Moscow in any respect. In the foreign policy arena, they say Finland does not seek to create controversy, but it is also generally even-handed - an assessment shared by foreign diplomats here. **********For example, after the American attack on Libya, Helsinki issued a statement criticizing the use of force to settle international disputes but also deploring terrorism. During the Vietnam War, there were no Finnish Government officials taking part in anti-American demonstrations, as there were in some other Scandinavian nations. **********''Whether the diplomatic winds come from the West or the East, we tend to hold our breath,'' said Jakko Iloniemi, former Ambassador to the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/16/world/war-comes-to-a-nicaraguan-village.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1986-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 984, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WAR COMES TO A NICARAGUAN VILLAGE", "print_headline": "WAR COMES TO A NICARAGUAN VILLAGE", "body_text": " **********A force of several hundred rebels raided this remote northern village on Wednesday, burning a state-owned coffee warehouse and several homes and capturing two Sandinista militiamen and a public health worker. **********Although the raid was relatively small in scale and had no great military significance, the guerrillas used tactics that have led many American politicians to criticize their movement. **********Yet they killed no civilians and inflicted no damage on the nearby Santa Rosa ranch, which is privately owned.

They are Miskito Indians who were forcibly removed from their homes along the Coco River in 1982 and brought here to cultivate coffee on government plantations. **********''Don't mention the possibility of us going back to the river,'' said one of the Indians, Ronaldo Centeno, who said the rebels had tried to capture him. ''Just talking about it makes us want to cry.'' **********Ironically, the Miskitos were moved from their homes along the contested river in part because they were perceived as being too sympathetic to the rebels. **********Faustino Mendez Ruiz, 44 years old, was taken away by the rebels and made to guide them into the surrounding hills. He managed to escape after 24 hours and was embraced by his mother as he arrived home. **********''We thought we might never see you again,'' she said. One Home Is Spared **********Mr. Mendez Ruiz was disconsolate as he collected the remains of his two hatchets and six machetes. **********''My tools are all burned,'' he said. ''How am I going to work now?'' One home in El Delirio was spared. ''My husband is sick in bed and can't be moved,'' said the head of the household, Francisca Ramirez. ''I begged them not to burn my house, and after they saw my husband's condition, they went on to the next house.'' **********The guerrillas who attacked here are part of the Jorge Salazar Command, a rebel unit that has been among the most active in Nicaragua over the last year. Its men have operated in parts of Boaco, Chontales, and Zelaya provinces, as well as here in Matagalpa. **********Last week, Minister of Defense Humberto Ortega Saavedra announced the formation of new army squads whose main responsibility will be to pursue the Salazar Command. He said wiping it out was necessary if the Government was to achieve ''the strategic defeat of the mercenary forces.'' **********This part of Nicaragua is rugged and nearly unpopulated. Civilians in the provincial capital said as many as 1,000 or more rebels, known as contras, operate here. They said the rebels receive at least some of their supplies by clandestine air drops from planes based in Honduras. **********''We are afraid of the contras,'' said a Miskito youth near El Delirio. **********''Anyone in uniform scares us,'' a companion added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/21/business/big-banks-in-race-for-district-foothold.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1986-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 860, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BIG BANKS IN RACE FOR DISTRICT FOOTHOLD", "print_headline": "BIG BANKS IN RACE FOR DISTRICT FOOTHOLD", "body_text": " **********A unanimous vote by the District of Columbia's City Council has touched off a race among the country's biggest banks, eager to stretch the geographic boundaries of their operations, to buy up Washington's local banking institutions. **********But with the nation's capital already open to limited interstate banking from adjacent Maryland and Virginia, the number of potential targets left to buy is rapidly dwindling. **********Of the 19 commercial banks in the District, four have already announced deals. Of the remaining 15, four have assets in excess of a billion dollars and are considered resistant to takeovers, one has assets of about $300 million and the rest have assets under $100 million. A bank with assets of less than $100 million would give an outsider a toehold but not much muscle in competition with old-line multibillion-dollar institutions such as Riggs National, the largest Washington bank, with assets of more than $5 billion. **********Several Opportunities Left **********''If you're looking for a doorstep and a charter, there are several opportunities still left,'' said Gilbert Keech, analyst with the Washington brokerage firm of Johnston, Lemon & Company. ''But if you're looking for size, there are very few.'' **********''Riggs is definitely not for sale,'' said George Beveridge, a spokesman for Joseph L. Allbritton, Riggs chairman, reflecting the sentiment at a couple of the other institutions. ''We are interested in acquiring banks ourselves.'' **********For New York banks, in particular, Washington is a desirable location for both lending and deposit taking. It represents a natural southern extension of their New York business. Many already have loan production or real estate lending offices in the District, and with such heavy emphasis on government and government-related businesses, the area is considered almost recession proof. **********''There is a lot of real estate lending here and the law firms are a most attractive and safe market segment,'' said James C. Nelson, president of the $1.3 billion National Bank of Washington. **********The presence of the Federal Government makes the District a high-income market with unusual stability. It has the fifth-largest consumer market in the country, with $32 billion in retail sales. Two-thirds of its work force are white-collar or service employees and it has the largest concentration of any region in the country of employees under age 35. **********But perhaps equally as important as the added business, Chase, Citicorp and others see the emergence of interregional banking in the nation's capital as a sign of the unrestricted interstate banking that the New York banks hope Congress will approve. ''It sends the clearest signal you could to Congress about the acceptability of nationwide interstate banking,'' said John Maloney, a spokesman for Citicorp. **********Many big banks have already made their interests known. According to Curtis McClinton, Washington's Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, in addition to Citicorp and Chase, Marine Midland, Security Pacific, the Bank of America, Chemical Bank, Morgan Guaranty and Irving Trust have all expressed at least tentative interest in entering Washington banking. **********The City Council's vote on Jan. 14 was by all measures a lobbying coup for Citicorp, which has relentlessly pursued state legislatures thought receptive to opening their borders to out-of-state banks. **********So far only a handful of states -Maine, Alaska, Arizona, New York and California - have passed full interstate banking laws, while many have joined regional banking compacts to allow regional banks to grow before the inevitable entry of the multinational banks. **********But for Citicorp, the nation's giant $140 billion banking organization, which has also played the role of proxy for all the large money center banks on the interstate issue, the victory carried a price. Under the District of Columbia Council bill, out-of-state banks interested in buying a Washington bank will have to lend between $50 million and $100 million to city economic development projects, hire at least 200 Washington residents and open at least two branches in economically depressed areas. **********Citicorp, which would have been kept out of the District by a bill approved in October over the veto of Mayor Marion S. Barry, turned the Council around with the promise of pouring millions into the city's poorer, predominantly black neighborhoods. **********In the three months since the October bill was passed, four deals have been struck for some of Washington's choicest banking properties. **********What's left are the very largest, which are not considered cooperative acquisition candidates, and very smallest, which may be too small to justify the cost of acquisition. As a result, a Citicorp study group is considering buying up several small banks. **********''The Virginia banks have been the ones making the deals,'' said Lawrence Fentriss, a spokesman for the $6.4 billion United Virginia Bankshares Inc. of Richmond, which just consummated its acquisition of the $1.1 billion N.S.& T. Bank of Washington. ''The Maryland banks have announced only one small deal for a Virginia bank, and no deals for Washington banks.''

Reached at his office, he declined to comment further. **********Analysts said that T.W.A.'s results were in line with their expectations.

Joedicke, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ''But it isn't of a magnitude that threatens the company. I don't think it's at a stage that puts the company in any kind of jeapordy.'' **********Mr. Joedicke and other analysts said that the prospects of a profitable third quarter were dim for the airline, since the level of international travel was down this summer and discounting among all carriers had continued. However, D. Joseph Corr, T.W.A's vice chairman, said that because of lower fuel costs and operating costs and T.W.A.'s new marketing direction he expected ''to show a substantial profit on an operating basis in the third quarter, which is traditionally T.W.A.'s strongest quarter, and to continue operating profitably in the fourth quarter.'' **********Mr. Corr said his optimism was based in part on proposed sale of a 50 percent stake on T.W.A.'s PARS computerized reservation system to the parent of Northwest Airlines, for about $140 million.

Iranian leaders have apparently been wary of committing their forces against 500,000 Iraqis, equipped with superior armor and air power, American officials said today. **********Strike in Retaliation **********Iran has said the attack was retaliation for the devastating Iraqi air raids on Iranian industrial centers, which had caused more than 300 deaths in Iran since last Sunday. **********''I think the Iranians felt they needed to do something to bloody the Iraqis,'' one American official said. **********In Iraq, press accounts said that there was a 21-gun salute in Baghdad to celebrate the ''big victory'' over Iran at the Shatt al Arab. But in Teheran, the President, Hojatolislam Ali Khamenei, said the attack was small and limited and had achieved its objective of administering a sharp ''rebuff'' to the Iraqis. Not the 'Final Blow' **********From the start, the Iranians had described the operation, code-named Karbala 4, as a ''destructive raid.'' It was named after a town holy to Shiite Moslems that is 60 miles south of Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. Most of Iran's population is Shiite. **********Hojatolislam Khamenei told Moslem worshipers at the weekly Friday prayer meeting at Teheran University that the ''final, fateful blow'' will be ordered ''when commanders deem the time appropriate.'' **********The Iranians said they had killed 3,500 Iraqis defending the four small islands, and left 6,500 wounded, The Iraqis, in turn, said they had wiped out ''thousands'' of Iranian soldiers. **********Iran also said Iraq had again used chemical weapons against the Iranians, lobbing shells containing chemical agents across to the Iranian side of the Shatt al Arab. **********The United States has charged Iraq in the past with using mustard and nerve gas against Iran, in violation of the Geneva agreement barring such weapons. **********The Iranian attack began Wednesday night with amphibious troops landing on the islands of Umm al Rasas, Umm Babi, Qate and Soheil, according to accounts from both sides. The Iraqis said today that they had recaptured Umm al Rasas, the largest and most important of the four islands. The Iranians said that they had withdrawn from the islands. Goal Was Basra, Iraq Says **********Iraq, saying the Iranian goal was not limited, but was intended to prepare for an assault on the city of Basra, said Iraqi troops had achieved ''a valiant victory.'' **********Basra, once Iraq's principal port, has been closed to shipping since the start of the war when Iran blocked the Shatt al Arab to Iraq-bound ships. But control of the city is deemed crucial to the Iraqis because if the Iranians took control, they would be strategically located to mount a drive on Baghdad. **********The commander of Iraq's III Army Corps in Basra, Lieut. Gen. Mahir Abdul al-Rashid, told The Associated Press at his headquarters: ''It was one of the bloodiest battles we've fought. It's clear they were trying to make a decisive breakthrough.'' **********''It was not a minor offensive,'' he said. ''It was fought on a 20-mile front opposite the Iranian town of Muhamara.'' Iraqi Air Raids **********With overwhelming air superiority over the Iranians, the Iraqis have struck in recent days at Bakhtaran, Eslamabad-e Gharbi and Do Rud, industrial cities near the Iraqi border. Hojatolislam Khamenei said Iran's forces had attacked in retaliation for the Iraqi air raids on residential areas, hospitals and schools. **********Because of the Iraqi superiority in advanced equipment, which has been supplied largely by France and the Soviet Union, the Iranians have been stepping up efforts in the last two years to secure as much advanced materiel as they can from the West. **********This effort also involved the secret sales of American antitank and air defense equipment to Iran in 1985 and 1986 in exchange for Iran's help in securing the release of three American hostages in Lebanon.

As they talked, their list of things to do grew longer and longer: ''We're starting from scratch, so there's everything to think about,'' Mrs. Tenzer said. **********Many June brides and grooms would be well advised to follow the Tenzers' example. Newly married couples, buoyed by the size of their joint paychecks, often fail to budget realistically. ''Set up an informal bookkeeping system at the beginning of the marriage, before things get out of control,'' advised Sidney Kess, a partner with the accounting firm of KMG Main Hurdman. Couples may want to continue their separate checking accounts, however, at least through the first year of marriage, so they can see where their money goes and how much disposable income remains. **********In the day-to-day budgeting, don't lose sight of long-term objectives - a car, a house, children. ''Make a list of your goals and put a dollar value on each one,'' recommended Elizabeth S. Lewin, a financial planner and author of ''Financial Fitness For Newlyweds''(Facts on File Publications, 1984, $8.95). As a rough rule of thumb, a young couple earning $75,000 combined might try to save 10 to 15 percent a year. To monitor your progress, prepare a net worth statement and update it annually. **********If you are planning to buy a house or apartment, experts say to budget a maximum of 30 percent of your gross income for monthly housing costs. If an inheritance or a big income increase is on the horizon, the percentage could go higher. If you both have been renting apartments, investigate whether either building plans to convert to cooperative status before deciding where to settle. **********Whether to hold joint title to real estate and other property is a tricky question. ''Joint ownership is much simpler on a day to day basis, or if one spouse dies,'' said Herbert M. Paul, a New York tax attorney. Those who opt for joint ownership have equal rights to the property; the assets bypass the estate when one spouse dies. But if the marriage splits up, ''it's not the worst thing to have something in your own name,'' he added, particularly if you brought investments or other assets into the marriage. **********Couples can expect to owe more in taxes than they did as single wage earners. Under the present tax rules, ''your combined income pushes you into higher brackets, but instead of paying 200 percent of the single rates, you'll pay 225 percent,'' because the joint tax tables presume that only one spouse works, said Mary L. Sprouse, a Los Angeles tax attorney. **********The relief afforded by the ''two-earner'' deduction (couples may deduct 10 percent of the lower earning spouse's income on their joint return, up to $3,000) depends on the composition of the joint income. Couples who earn $50,000 combined, with one spouse earning 70 percent of the total, come out best. Generally, the greater the disparity between the two incomes, the more valuable the deduction - which is, however, slated to disappear under both the House and Senate tax plans. **********Couples who must pay higher taxes should check whether enough is being withheld from their paychecks; withholding at the single rate typically will not cover the liability on a joint return. Have the tax withheld at a higher rate or, if that is not sufficient, begin making quarterly payments of estimated tax. **********While most couples file joint tax returns, those who have a great disparity in income combined with high medical bills may want to file separately, because medical expenses are subject to a floor calculated on the basis of adjusted gross income. Separate returns can also be used as records of which spouse owns specific assets in the event of a divorce or a lawsuit. However, married couples who file separate returns cannot claim the two-earner deduction or a credit for child care expenses. **********In the first year of marriage, ''compute your tax both ways, to see whether you owe less by filing jointly or separately,'' Miss Sprouse advised. **********Spouses who file joint returns are both liable for the tax, even if one spouse earns all the income. Mr. Paul tells a cautionary tale of a client who, two years after her divorce, was contacted by the I.R.S. for payment of taxes on income generated by her former husband's business. The moral: Review the return and ask enough questions to understand what you are signing. WHEN both spouses work, the couple should coordinate any company insurance benefits that they contribute to. 'You don't want to pay for dual coverage when one policy is probably better than the other,'' said Claire S. Longden, a vice president with Butcher & Singer, an investment banking firm. Good clues, she said, are the deductible and the extent of coverage for psychiatric and dental care. Many plans today still do not cover pregnancy, so would-be parents should check the fine print early on; you cannot purchase coverage after a woman becomes pregnant. **********Compare premiums and coverage on life insurance policies, too. ''There are big differences in group life insurance today,'' Mrs. Longden said. She added that term insurance may be less expensive than employer-sponsored group coverage. **********Finally, review Individual Retirement Accounts, Keogh plans and company pension and retirement benefits, changing the beneficiaries as needed. Prepare or update your wills. Some couples may want to leave everything to each other, but others may need to make provision for elderly parents; in that case, discuss the problem together to devise an equitable settlement. No Tax-Deductible Tickets **********Two years ago, the Internal Revenue Service told a college football fan that he could not deduct the amount he gave to the school's athletic scholarship program as a charitable contribution, because his donation entitled him to purchase preferred seating at athletic events. After hearing complaints from universities and sports fans, the I.R.S. has recently clarified its position. **********As a general rule, payments can be deducted to the extent they exceed the value of any benefits you receive in return. For example, well-wishers who pay more than the standard purchase price for tickets can deduct the premium as a contribution to the school. Conversely, donors who buy tickets that would have been available in any event, and make contributions to the school, can only deduct the amount of the donation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/08/business/in-financial-decisions-a-lesser-role-for-taxes.html": {"writer_name": "Gary Klott", "pub_date": "1986-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1526, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN FINANCIAL DECISIONS, A LESSER ROLE FOR TAXES", "print_headline": "IN FINANCIAL DECISIONS, A LESSER ROLE FOR TAXES", "body_text": " **********From deciding how much to spend on a new home to choosing the best investments, Americans will need to plan their personal financial lives in far different ways when the Tax Reform Act of 1986 goes into effect in a few weeks. **********The steep drop in tax rates and the curtailment of dozens of tax benefits mean taxes will play a sharply diminished role in financial decisions, and will force individuals to adopt a new set of personal planning criteria. The new tax law might even affect decisions as basic as whether to work overtime or take a second job. **********The new law will encourage people to focus much more on the economic soundness or the personal benefits of their investments, rather than the tax benefits, and rely more on their own personal resources to finance expenditures that will be less heavily subsidized by the tax code - such as homes, medical bills, business equipment and consumer purchases. **********Many people will also need to take greater initiative in saving for their retirement, since many tax-favored methods, including Individual Retirement Accounts, will become much more restrictive. **********David S. Rhine, a tax partner at Seidman & Seidman, the accounting firm, said of the new tax law: ''It's encouraging people to do more things on their own rather than with the incentive of a tax deduction.'' **********Perhaps the most difficult part of the transition for many Americans will be adjusting to the diminished role of tax benefits. Most people have never lived in a period when tax benefits were worth so little, or tax rates so low. Fifty years ago was the last time individual rates were as low as they will be under the new system. **********For the estimated 80 percent of Americans who will be in the 15 percent tax bracket when the new tax system is fully in place in 1988, tax deductions will be worth no more than 15 cents on the dollar. **********These changes hold broad implications. A home buyer now in the 40 percent tax bracket might find mortgage and property tax payments of $2,000 a month comfortably affordable, since the tax savings reduces the out-of-pocket cost to $1,200. But when this family moves into the 28 percent tax bracket in 1988, the out-of-pocket cost will increase $240 a month. **********Similarly, the repeal of the deduction for sales taxes and consumer interest will mean that financing consumer purchases will be a more costly proposition. If this homeowner was a New Yorker, and bought a $1,000 item by credit card that charges 18 percent annual interest, the real cost of the purchase will increase by 9.5 percent when the deductions are repealed. **********At the same time, the lower individual tax rates will mean a fundamental shift in the way people regard taxable income. **********In the past, many wealthy individuals - and even many middle-income individuals - viewed taxable income with a sometimes allergic reaction. Many were reluctant to work overtime or take on extra assignments for fear of being pushed into a higher tax bracket. Under the new system, individuals will be allowed to keep more of what they earn. A Crimp in Tax Shelters **********The new system will also remove much of the attraction of investing in sophisticated tax shelters or negotiating executive compensation packages to include elaborate deferred compensation plans. **********''Taking money is simple, but it also used to be expensive when it was taxed at 50 percent,'' said Richard B. Stanger, national director of employee benefits services at the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse. ''But at 28 percent, it's not so expensive any longer.'' **********Because of new restrictions on employer-sponsored retirement plan benefits, Mr. Stanger suggests that higher-income individuals do more retirement saving on their own. ''Given the reduced tax break, I would be concentrating less on employer plans, and accumulating and investing my own cash,'' he said. **********Another reason many people are likely to favor taking cash sooner, rather than later, is the concern among many taxpayers that they may be deferring taxable income into a future year, when rates are higher. 'Somewhat Flexible' **********''I would remain somewhat flexible beyond the short-term,'' said Herbert Paul, a tax lawyer. ''There's a distinct possibility you'll see further changes in the tax law - quite possible an increase in tax rates as a way to help make up for the deficit.'' **********Nonetheless, tax advisers doubt future tax changes will fundamentally alter the shift in long-term investment strategies that will be required by the the new law - to focus more on the profits rather than the tax advantages. With tax rates reduced and many deductions curtailed, tax savings will no longer add as much to the investment's return. Nor can they be counted on as much to make marginal investments profitable. **********''If I were to summarize the tax bill, the Government is telling people, 'I'm no longer going to be your partner,' '' said Allen Cymrot, president of Kemper/Cymrot Inc., a California real estate investment firm. **********The Government, he said, will no longer subsidize as much of your losses - nor will it take as much of your profits. ''The emphasis is clearly on income-oriented investments,'' he said. Only Part of the Picture **********To be sure, focusing on the changes in the Federal tax brackets give individuals only part of the picture. **********Byrle Abbin, managing director of Federal tax services at the accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Company, said individuals would need to take into account state and local income tax rates in order to give a true indication of the tax bite or tax savings from a particular investment. A person in the 28 percent Federal income tax bracket might well be in a 35 or 40 percent tax bracket when state and local taxes are figured in. **********As an example, Mr. Abbin points to the repeal of preferential capital gains treatment. Residents of states whose income taxes are linked to the Federal tax system will likely lose special capital gains treatment on their state returns as well. Unless changes are made to state income tax laws, the impact will be especially harsh in high-tax states, such as New York, California and Massachusetts, Mr. Abbin said. **********In New York State, for example, the effective Federal and state tax rate on long-term capital gains for a person in the 28 percent Federal tax bracket will jump to 37.4 percent in 1988 from 22.6 percent now, according to Mr. Abbin. For New York City residents, the combined Federal, state and city tax rate will rise to 40.6 percent, from 25.5 percent. **********For upper-income taxpayers who feel these tax rates still provide incentive for sheltering income, there will be plenty of opportunities. While tax shelter syndicators have been restructuring deals to focus more heavily on generating income, the investments will still offer tax benefits -even if they only help shelter income. 'Working Interest' **********Some investors might even be lured to a special type of oil and gas drilling deal in which investors have a ''working interest'' in the venture. In one of the few major exceptions to the tough new restrictions on tax shelters, these ''working interest'' investors will still be allowed to use tax shelter losses to offset their salary and other income. **********But investment advisers are urging extreme caution. Joel I. Berson, a partner in the New York law firm of Moore, Berson, Lifflander & Mewhinney, notes that ''working interests'' expose the investor to unlimited personal liability, which is in sharp contrast to most partnerships, in which investors have limited liability. ''You have to be very careful about the financial stability of the operator and the terms of the operating agreement,'' he said. **********Even if an investor is shopping for a more conventional partnership, the financial health of the sponsor has to be looked at more closely, said William Brennan, an investment adviser in Valley Forge, Pa. Many shelter promoters, he said, have been hurt by the change in the tax laws, as well as problems in the oil patch. Many, Mr. Brennan said, could face bankruptcy. A general partner who is preoccupied with bankruptcy proceedings is not likely to devote full attention to managing the day-to-day affairs of the partnership, even if the partnership itself is not threatened, he said. **********But for many Americans, the compulsion to shelter income will be reduced. ''Even if I pay more in taxes,'' said Norman Ornstein, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, ''the fact that I won't have as much of a nagging feeling to do more to reduce my taxes is a psychological benefit for which I'm willing to pay a little bit.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/11/business/court-blocks-anderson-clayton-s-buyback-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1986-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 429, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Court Blocks Anderson, Clayton's Buyback Plan", "print_headline": "Court Blocks Anderson, Clayton's Buyback Plan", "body_text": " **********The Delaware Chancery Court yesterday blocked Anderson, Clayton & Company, the Houston-based consumer products concern, from executing its management-sponsored recapitalization plan. **********A preliminary injunction issued by Chancellor William T.

Olson will take over as chairman of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, its first new leader since the breakup of the Bell system. A 43-year telephone company veteran, Mr. Olson started his career cleaning out manholes. He eventually was promoted to president of Illinois Bell before moving to A.T.&T. headquarters in 1977. **********In an interview yesterday with two New York Times reporters, David E. Sanger and Calvin Sims, at the company's Madison Avenue headquarters, Mr. Olson discussed the company's future in long distance and computers and its new competition. Excerpts from the interview follow: **********Q. As you look back at the divestiture agreement, are there some profitable businesses that you regret giving away to Bell operating companies? **********A. I think - given the arguments at the time, all the antitrust issues, all that was going on in Congress - that A.T.& T.'s agreement was the right agreement. We did not agree originally, for example, about giving away the Yellow Pages, that was Judge Greene's decision. I haven't changed my mind a bit. **********Q. The regional Bell operating companies, or R.B.O.C.'s, appear to be moving in on A.T.&T.'s territory. Are they entering areas that the courts did not intend for them? **********A. The most controversial areas the R.B.O.C.'s have expressed an interest in are manufacturing, long distance, and information services. As far as the long distance and manufacturing businesses are concerned, A.T.& T. has made its position clear: If the environment that existed at the time we signed the divestiture judgment remains, the agreement still holds. On the information services side, we've not taken that position, but only wanted an interpretation to be sure we understood the types of services information services included. As long as long distance is not provided, we do not object to them entering this market. **********Q. If the long distance market does not become more competitive - you still hold about 80 percent - will you be forced to drop objections to allowing the regionals to compete for long distance customers? **********A. I think that it's a very competitive environment and that we ought to allow the environment to work. I see companies like MCI receiving funding from I.B.M., and I see United Telecommunications joining forces with GTE Sprint to form a new company called US Sprint. They have substantial resources. So I think there is plenty of competition, and any argument that says you need the R.B.O.C.'s in long distance for there to be competition doesn't hold water. Q. Two weeks ago, the Federal **********Communications Commission lowered A.T.&T.'s profit margin to 12.2 percent, from 12.75 percent for long distance telephone service. What effect will this have on the company? **********A. The new rate means we will have to reduce our revenues by $100 million annually. If you take the old tax rate, that's a $50 million reduction in earnings or 5 cents a share, so it's not a major impact on our earnings. But it puts an artificial umbrella over the competitive marketplace, which I don't think helps the competitors. **********Q. Where will A.T.&T.'s share of long distance stabilize? **********A. I'm not going to make projections on future market share. One thing that is encouraging is our rate reduction of 22 percent since 1984, partly because of improvement in our own productivity and because of the shift in access charges. People use the telephone more often when the price is lower whether it's for business purposes or residential calls or data transfer. **********Q. Some charge that A.T.&T. has essentially become a re-seller in the computer business and that you are offering your own 3B minicomputers with few networking capabilities. **********A. I still feel, given the short period of time we've been at this, that we've made a lot of progress. Have we done everything right? The answer is no. The PC 6300  [ made by Olivetti ]  is in second place in the market, starting from zero. But it is a fiercely competitive marketplace, with low margins. The Unix PC we have not been as successful with. It is a superb machine, but there is not nearly enough applications software out there to run on that machine, so it has not met our expectations. I don't think we understood that market as well as we should have. Q. Do you plan to withdraw the **********Unix PC and try again? **********A. The Unix operating system will continue to be a very powerful operating system. The Unix PC is still part of our product line. Convergent Technologies has downsized their output, and I am not going to speculate over the next few months on just what is going to happen in that particular product line. **********Q. Even many of your customers suggest that A.T.& T. has not yet achieved satisfactory connectivity between computer systems. **********A. Well we have made a lot of improvement. Our Starlan  [ a local area network ]  is beginning to move a lot of product. We have been revisiting that whole strategy. I think that we have learned an awful lot in the past couple of years. We are going to be in the computer business. But it is going to be in an array of computer products that leverage off of our networking skills, not all of which we have to provide ourselves. **********Q.How long will it take before the computer business is profitable? **********A. We haven't yet lost our appetite. But I don't want to look at ''the computer business.'' I want to look at the total array of products that A.T.&T. will offer, complex kinds of information management."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/12/world/thousands-celebrate-ruler-s-fall-in-haitian-city.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1986-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 900, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THOUSANDS CELEBRATE RULER'S FALL IN HAITIAN CITY", "print_headline": "THOUSANDS CELEBRATE RULER'S FALL IN HAITIAN CITY", "body_text": " **********Thousands of Haitians converged on this city today for celebrations that combine traditional Mardi Gras festivities with joy over the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship. **********The local bishop presided over a festive open-air mass, opposition figures emerged from the underground, and a band called Volcano played. By late afternoon, the city was taken over by the Haitian equivalent of tailgate and block parties. **********''Today is a day of victory, a day of glory,'' Emanuel Constant, the city's Roman Catholic bishop, said in a homily spoken before a crowd of about 10,000. ''We have gone from a situation close to slavery to a situation of liberty.'' **********The crowd, many wearing straw hats or holding umbrellas to ward off the blazing midday sun, roared its approval. **********''Everyone said no to injustice, no to all forms of torture, no to theft and no to all forms of discrimination,'' the bishop said, referring to ''the events of Feb. 7'' - the day Jean Claude Duvalier fled Haiti. Statue of Independence Hero **********With his back to the modernistic cathedral here, Bishop Constant faced a statue of Jean Jacques Dessalines, a hero of Haiti's independence struggle of 1804. Long considered the birthplace of Haitian independence, Gonaives, about 90 miles north of Port-au-Prince, is now revered in Haiti as the birthplace of the rebellion that culminated in the fall Friday of the 29-year-old Duvalier dynasty. Although obscured by today's throng, the lower walls of the cathedral were still covered with a fringe of angry graffiti from last month's protests. One read: ''It is better to die than to live as Duvalier's slaves.'' **********This city's traditional militance also contributed an undercurrent of protest to the festivities. **********''Despite our joy, people who remain vigilant see with uneasiness the infiltration in the National Council of Government and in the Ministries, some men of the past - former ministers who supported the dictatorial Duvalier regime in all its ferocity,'' read an unsigned ''Manifesto of Committed Gonaives Citizens,'' which circulated here today. 'Total and Definitive' **********''These elements do not have any place in the bosom of the new government,'' the tract continued. ''The people watch and wait for their liberation to be total and definitive.'' **********Brother Luciano Pharaon, who had been active organizing anti-Duvalier resistance, said in an interview: ''The majority of people here are very skeptical. They're not enthusiastic. For them this represents Duvalierism without Duvalier.'' **********He said that ''thousands'' of residents here have signed petitions calling for the removal of former Duvalier officials from the ruling junta, including - Alix Cineas and Col. Prospere Avril. **********Richard Garnirer, who described himself as a veteran of 15 years of anti-Duvalier activity in New York and Washington, expressed a similar view. 'Kick These People Here' **********''The work is not done yet,'' he said. ''We have so many people from Duvalier's time in the new regime. We have to kick these people out.'' **********Mr. Garnirer was wearing a new souvenir T-shirt, one of many that were printed up over the weekend. It read: ''Liberated Haiti - Long Live Feb. 7, 1986.'' **********A man standing next to him, Michel Micheler, wore another shirt, which read: ''Gonaives, Pivot City of the Revolution - Operation Dechouke May 23, 1984 - Feb. 7, 1986.'' **********Protests first broke out against the regime in Gonaives in May 1984. ''Dechouke,'' a Creole word meaning uprooted, is the popular term here for the anti-Duvalier protest movement. Change in National Colors **********People who have been unable to buy the new T-shirts wore red and blue, the colors of the Haitian flag until it was changed to red and black by Mr. Duvalier's father, Francois. Red-and-blue armbands, headbands, hats, sashes and ribbons pinned to labels brightened the scene. **********Red-and-blue pennants and flags decorated a caravan of horn-tooting cars, buses and pickup trucks which made the two-hour drive from Port-au-Prince to here. Townspeople along Route 1 turned out with red-and-blue flags to cheer on the celebrants. **********In steady succession, brightly painted buses arrived here from north and south. Their radios blaring popular music, the buses creaked and swayed under the weight of passengers riding on their roofs and clinging to their backs. **********Some of the excitement was caused by political militants, many of whom had worked underground here in recent years. 'The People's Demands' **********''I arrived here clandestinely on Oct. 11, 1984,'' said Pollux St. Jean, a local organizer who was quickly surrounded by a crowd of admirers. ''We fought this battle for everyone - we have to give the government time to respond to the people's demands.'' **********Between the speeches, the biggest hit of the day was the calypso band which sent the crowd clapping and undulating to its infectious rhythms. **********One popular singer, Jean Michel Gauthier, sang a protest song he had composed about the closing of Radio Soleil. Owned by the Catholic Church, the radio was closed last month by Mr. Duvalier in an attempt to stop the spreading protests. Its name means Radio Sun in English. **********Jumping to their feet, the crowd joined Mr. Gauthier's refrain with a mighty chorus of thousands of voices: ''When I don't see the sun, I can't sleep, I can't work, I can't eat.

''A marketing poll showed that more people thought we were a refrigerator than a store,'' said John N. Nordstrom, co-chairman of the Seattle-based retailer of shoes and apparel. **********Nordstrom overcame the confusion, quickly attracting a large following for its higher-priced lines of men's, women's and children's fashions. The California operation, with 16 of the company's 45 huge outlets, has played a big role in doubling company sales to $1.3 billion over the past four years, turning Nordstrom into one of the nation's largest specialty retailers. **********Now Nordstrom is heading east, hoping to make another fast start in an affluent market. **********This September, the company expects to start building a 200,000-square-foot, $27.5 million flagship store in the Tysons Corner shopping center in McLean, Va. A second store is planned for another Washington suburb, Pentagon City, Va., and other sites in the Northeast are being considered. **********The venture is a major challenge for the family-run company, which is counting on its dedication to customer service and a seemingly limitless selection of merchandise to distinguish it from such well-entrenched competitors as Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord & Taylor and Bloomingdale's, all of which have stores in the Washington area. **********''They've done an excellent job in selling their emphasis on service to the carriage trade,'' said David V. Jackson, a retailing analyst with Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy & Gardner. ''In most stores you buy what they have, but at Nordstrom you get what you want.'' **********Company lore abounds with stories of managers going out of their way to keep customers happy. **********In the Glendale, Calif., store, a shoe salesman reportedly dug into his own pocket to give an embarrassed customer some change to make a purchase. A manager in the men's suit department of the same store is said to have dispatched a tailor to a dissatisfied customer's office for a free fitting - and a free suit. **********Although analysts do not discount the challenge of breaking into the tough East Coast market, they express few reservations about Nordstrom's plans. **********''They'll be going in with some well-entrenched competitors, but they learn very quickly,'' said Monroe Greenstein, a retailing analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company. He called Nordstrom one of the best-managed retailers in the country, and said that even the few mistakes the company has made have helped to streamline operations. **********In the first half of 1984, for example, earnings fell nearly 10 percent despite a sales increase of about 23 percent, when company buyers overstocked several lines of house-brand clothing. ''Nordstrom hasn't made that mistake since,'' Mr. Greenstein said. **********The store's focus on service and its wide variety of merchandise has paid off handsomely for the chain, which has outlets in Alaska, Oregon, Montana and Utah in addition to California and Washington. **********Its sales per square foot are among the highest in the industry, amounting to $293 for 1985, a 9.7 percent increase over 1984, analysts said. The company has more than doubled its selling space in the last five years, to 4.7 million square feet. **********Meanwhile, earnings have soared, up 23.1 percent in 1985, to $50.1 million, from $40.7 million the year before. Revenues rose 35.6 percent, to $1.3 billion, from $958.6 million. The company's stock, about 46 percent of which is owned by the Nordstrom family, has jumped, too, from a high of $12.375 in 1980 to the low $70's recently. In over-the-counter trading Friday, it closed at $71.50. **********The management of the 85-year-old chain, headed by a third generation of Nordstroms, is looking to the East with caution, despite its remarkable success in the West. **********The top officials - John N. Nordstrom, 49 years old, and his cousin Bruce A. Nordstrom, 52, who serves as the company's other co-chairman, and John's brother James F., 46, its president - declined to be interviewed about their expansion plans and refused to be photographed, saying that publicity was detrimental to their esprit de corps. **********''We don't know anything the other guys don't know, and we don't have any secrets,'' John Nordstrom said. ''All publicity does is give us a swelled head, and we can always do better. The sales people are the real stars.'' **********That attitude typifies the Nordstrom management style, which seems less like that of a major retailer than a one-store operation in a small town. In fact, Nordstrom began as a shoe store in Seattle in 1901, growing to become the largest shoe retailer in the West before purchasing a financially struggling clothing store in 1963. **********Nordstrom has a history of ignoring conventional retailing practices for clothing stores, favoring instead many of the approaches that it used successfully in selling shoes. **********Inventories, for example, are up to twice as large as the industry norm for clothing stores, with a typical Nordstrom outlet stocking 75,000 pairs of shoes, 5,000 men's dress shirts and 7,000 neckties. The huge variety of merchandise, which favors traditional styles, makes it possible to encourage shoppers to purchase entire outfits - including hats, gloves, jewelry and other accessories. **********Nordstrom does not rely on markdowns and advertising to increase sales. Even in Southern California, where the market is notoriously promotional, Nordstrom spends about half as much as its competitors on advertising, preferring to use the savings for prizes and incentives for its sales staff. **********The sales staff work on commission, which allows the more successful employees to earn $50,000 a year. Everyone on the staff, from clerks to senior executives, is required to train on the selling floor to become sensitive to customer needs. **********Most of the company's operations are decentralized, with area managers and buyers given the authority to adjust merchandising and buying to suit the tastes of customers in a particular area. Sales clerks keep detailed records of their customers' sizes and preferences, and will accept virtually any item for return without question. **********''Our return policy is absolute customer satisfaction,'' said Leeann Decker, a company spokesman. **********The company expects to add one store a year over the next four to five years on the East Coast. At the same time, it will add two stores a year on the West Coast, a slower pace than in the past few years. The growth will cost about $100 million in each of the next two years, according to the company's latest annual report, with estimates beyond 1987 incomplete. **********Analysts expect the company to send some of its most successful buyers, sales staff and managers to work in the Tysons Corner store, which is scheduled to open in the fall of 1987. The Pentagon City store is scheduled to open in 1989. **********Although some potential competitors on the East Coast, including Saks and Lord & Taylor, declined to comment on Nordstrom's plans, analysts said that retailers were keeping a close watch on the move. **********''In California, everyone laughed when they sat down to play,'' Edward Weller, a retailing analyst with E. F. Hutton Inc., said of the earlier reception to Nordstrom.

The study, which will strongly influence the Administration's policy toward junk bonds and, indirectly, toward the hostile takeovers that the bonds often finance, arrived at a startling conclusion: There is no cause for concern, even though junk bond issues have soared in recent years. Rather, the report concluded that junk bonds are an ''innovative reaction,'' with only such risks as were ''fully obvious'' to investors. There is no justification, it said, for limits to junk-bond financing in takeovers - or anywhere else, for that matter. **********Such assurances ought to be welcome from an agency that was created to deal with highly leveraged holding companies and other securities abuses of the 1920's. Alas, in this study the S.E.C. staff lobbied the issues rather than explored them. The report seems designed more to discredit the Federal Reserve Board's recent ruling restricting junk bond financing of tender offers than to examine important issues. **********The total of junk bonds outstanding has grown rapidly, to about $100 billion. Sheer numbers aside, there are three particularly troubling developments: The declining quality of junk bonds, the acceptance of an accounting mechanism that encourages institutional investments in ''zero-coupon'' junk bonds, and the increasing likelihood that the risks of junk bonds will be borne not by sophisticated institutions but by ''widows and orphans.'' **********The quality seems to have declined as the volume has grown. Turner Broadcasting and Scovill Manufacturing, to name just two junk bond issuers, have sold bonds on the basis of operating incomes that fell far short of the level required simply to make the necessary interest payments. **********Whether these bonds will go into default soon no one can say for sure. Instead of examining prospectuses for a broad array of recent junk bond issues, the commission staff relied in its study on some stale research -the same research promoted by the junk bond underwriters that the S.E.C. is supposed to be watching. The research shows a relatively low default rate for junk bonds that were issued some years ago in quite different circumstances and by companies superior to those issuing junk bonds today. **********How do we know that the quality of junk bonds is declining? Consider that late innovation of corporate finance, the zero-coupon junk bond. ''Zero's'' are bonds that pay no interest until maturity. These were invented a few years ago to enable investors to lock up the high yields then available on Treasury bonds without having to reinvest the semiannual interest payments. They became attractive because the repayment of Treasury bonds is a certainty. **********Metromedia, Turner Broadcasting and others have issued zero-coupon junk bonds not because their credit was so good but because it was so bad. Their operating cash flows fell far short of the required interest payments. But in today's markets, it seems, the poorer the borrower the more he can make lenders wait for their money. **********Why would institutional investors buy such a bond? One explanation -and this is the second of the issues that the commission ought to have explored but did not - may be that the accountants permit mutual funds and other institutions holder of zero-coupon junk bonds to report as current income the advertised rate of interest on the bonds, even though that interest is neither being paid in full nor, worse yet, being earned in full by the issuer of the bond. Thus, a business that reports operating income, before interest charges, of only $50 million may have outstanding bonds that enable the mutual funds, insurance companies and other bondholders to claim aggregate income of, say, $70 million. **********The study concluded that these risks, large or small, are ''fully obvious to the investors.'' Investors are rational and will not knowingly buy a bad deal. Which raises the third and perhaps most important question: Who is at risk in these transactions? To a large extent, and just how large we do not know, the institutional buyers of these instruments may not be the ones ultimately left holding the bag. The commission should have looked at this question but did not, relying instead on uncritical assumptions about free markets. **********For example, a substantial portion of these bonds has been purchased by struggling savings and loan companies willing to make a desperate, all-or-nothing bet - if the junk bonds pay off, the institutions survive; if they default, the savings and loans fail but Government insurance pays off the depositors. Fortunately, the Federal Home Loan Bank seems to be bringing that under better control. **********In addition, there are the ''high yield'' bond funds that are aggressively marketed to often quite unsophisticated investors. Retirees and others who in the early 1980's came to depend on high interest rates from money-market funds and certificates of deposit now are eager to replace the income they have lost. As recently as July 1986, one prestigious brokerage firm was still advertising income funds yielding as much as 14.5 percent. Since they receive the prospectus of the high-yield bond fund, rather than the reports or prospectuses of the issuers of the junk bonds held by the fund, these investors have no direct way of knowing how much or in what ways their new 14.5 percent investments have changed from their old, safe ones. **********Finally, and most seriously, increasing numbers of corporations are terminating employee pension plans to recapture excess assets in the pension trust. To refund those pension obligations at the lowest possible cost, the employers often purchase single-payment annuity contracts from those insurance companies that can offer the best price. Of course, the companies that offer the best prices are those that have invested heavily in high-yield bonds. Once the plan is terminated and the annuity contracts purchased, the employer may have no further responsibility to its pensioners, so that it has every reason to extract the last dollar of ''excess assets'' from the trust. But the greater the saving for the employer, the greater the risk for the pensioners. These unsuspecting retirees and employees, who typically have no role in the bargaining and get none of the savings, are left to depend on an insurance company of uncertain worth. **********The risk of default on these annuity contracts may come from both ends of the investment spectrum. The least profitable junk bond issuers, being most vulnerable to an economic chill, may default on their obligations, and those that are most profitable will try to redeem their high-coupon bonds and replace them with new securities with lower yields. An insurance company relying on junk bonds to sustain higher than ordinary levels of income for the 10 years and more necessary to honor those annuities might, therefore, see its income sharply reduced in both cases. **********Here, then, are three complex, major issues that require the kind of digging for which the S.E.C. is well equipped and which is well within the S.E.C.'s historic mandate. The study failed on all three counts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/07/world/nuclear-disaster-looking-backward-nuclear-accident-ukraine-soviet-account.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 889, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Chronology", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NUCLEAR ACCIDENT IN THE UKRAINE: THE SOVIET ACCOUNT", "print_headline": "NUCLEAR DISASTER: LOOKING BACKWARD; NUCLEAR ACCIDENT IN THE UKRAINE: THE SOVIET ACCOUNT", "body_text": " **********In the last week, Soviet officials and the Soviet press have issued a trickle of facts about what happened at the Chernobyl atomic power station in the Ukraine. The following is a reconstruction of the accident drawn mainly from these accounts. **********Saturday, April 26: At 1:23 A.M., an explosion of undetermined source touches off a fire in the roofing of the engine room of the No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl power station at Pripyat. The reactor is functioning at a low output of 200 megawatts. **********Firefighters, working in extreme heat battling flames as high as 100 feet, keep the blaze from spreading. But the reactor becomes exposed, a fire breaks out inside and radioactive material escapes. The reactor is shut down, but the graphite moderator core appears to continue burning. Two people die fighting the fire, and 204 are hospitalized with radiation sickness, 18 of them in serious condition. **********How quickly the word spreads is unclear. Assistance is summoned from fire departments as far away as Kiev, 70 miles to the south. Police officers from neighboring towns converge on Pripyat, set up roadblocks and maintain order.

Hundreds of buses start arriving in Pripyat. **********A Government commission is appointed under Boris Y. Shcherbina, a Deputy Prime Minister. Members arrive in Pripyat and find that local officials have not made a proper assessment of the dangers. **********Sunday, April 27: At 1:50 P.M., 36 hours after the accident, the local radio announces the start of the evacuation of Pripyat, and party workers fan out through all the buildings of the city of 40,000. Marshaling points are avoided to prevent panic, and buses pick up people at their buildings. **********The evacuation gets under way at 2 P.M., and by 4:20 P.M. the city is empty except for workers who remain to maintain basic services. They will leave two days later. **********A total of 1,100 buses take part, and in Kiev residents note that some bus services are disrupted. **********Monday, April 28: In the morning, Swedish monitoring stations report heightened radiation levels. The Swedes conclude that the radioactivity is coming on prevailing winds from the Soviet Union and demand information. The Russians deny any emission of radioactive material. **********At 9 P.M., the Soviet press agency Tass and the evening television news programs issue a brief statement saying that there has been an accident at the Chernobyl plant and that a reactor was damaged. They say aid is being given to those affected. No mention is made of radioactive emissions. **********Tuesday, April 29: An international outcry begins, and rumors begin to circulate about the accident. United Press International reports that 2,000 have been killed. **********Reports from Sweden and West Germany say Soviet diplomats have approached private nuclear agencies for advice on fighting graphite fires. **********At 9 P.M., the Soviet Government issues its second bulletin, disclosing ''a certain leak of radioactive substances,'' the evacuation of Pripyat and three other settlements, the two deaths and the makeup of the Government commission. It reports that the three other reactors have been shut down. **********Western tourists in Kiev call their embassies in Moscow seeking information and make preparations to leave. They report life in Kiev is normal. **********Wednesday, April 30: The daily Government bulletin says there has been no fission chain reaction. It says that in addition to 2 dead, 197 were hospitalized and 49 of them were discharged. The bulletin says the water and air in Kiev are safe. **********Envoys of Britain, the Netherlands, France and Austria are summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow and briefed about the accident. They report no new information. **********Thursday, May 1: The Government bulletin says that 18 people are in critical condition and that radioactivity is decreasing in the area of the power station. Mikhail S. Gorbachev presides over May Day celebrations. The departure of Western students and tourists gathers pace. A large group of students arrive in Moscow, then board planes for London. **********Friday, May 2: In Hamburg, West Germany, the Moscow party chief, Boris N. Yeltsin, says radioactivity levels at the plant are falling but are still too high for people to enter. **********Saturday, May 3: Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Yegor K. Ligachev, the second-ranking member of the Politburo, and Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, the Ukrainian party chief, head a high-ranking team that inspects the region of Chernobyl. **********A four-man United States Army team arrives to start monitoring conditions in Moscow. **********Monday, May 5: The Government announces that dikes are being built along the Pripyat River to prevent potential contamination. **********Hans Blix, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, arrives in Moscow for discussions of the accident. **********Tuesday, May 6: Pravda and Izvestia, the Government paper, publish extensive accounts of what happened at Chernobyl, and officials hold a press conference at which they reveal that the evacuation did not take place until 36 hours after the accident.

He added, ''We are trying to get at least three more slots, so that we can run 15 flights daily, but not necessarily from Texas Air.'' **********The deal with Pan Am was struck in order to satisfy objections by the Justice Department that the proposed merger could reduce shuttle competition in the corridor. The Justice Department withdrew its objections after the Pan Am deal. New Questions **********But the Transportation Department questioned whether Pan Am's existing slots facilities, combined with those it would get from Texas Air, were sufficient to support a ''competitive shuttle'' at La Guardia. **********It said Texas Air and Pan Am ''must explain'' how Pan Am will operate competitive service of the type required for the shuttle routes. **********The Federal agency also said it would not approve the proposed merger until the sale of the routes and facilities had taken place. It also required that any resale to Texas Air of gates or slots be subject to approval by the Transportation Department."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/30/business/shuttle-inquiry-business-aspects-shuttle-s-builders-have-varying-stakes-program.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2036, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHUTTLE'S BUILDERS HAVE VARYING STAKES IN PROGRAM'S FUTURE", "print_headline": "THE SHUTTLE INQUIRY: BUSINESS ASPECTS; SHUTTLE'S BUILDERS HAVE VARYING STAKES IN PROGRAM'S FUTURE", "body_text": " **********Many of the leading names in the United States aerospace industry are key contractors in the space shuttle program. As in other major aerospace projects, however, their dependence on the program is not as great as their huge National Aeronautics and Space Administration contracts might suggest because a great deal of the work is passed to hundreds of subcontractors. **********Nevertheless, all the industry giants involved in the project were shaken, financially as well as emotionally, by the explosion of the Challenger. **********A day after the disaster, they declined to comment on their theories about the accident's possible causes. But they said they all expect to participate in NASA's investigation. **********''Anything we could say at this point would be pure speculation,'' said Thomas Russell, vice president in charge of corporate development and stategic planning at Morton Thiokol Inc., the manufacturer of the shuttle's twin solid-fuel rockets. **********Mr. Russell said he and others in the industry hoped that the investigation of the recovered wreckage and computer and other flight data would point to a clear explanation at an early date. **********Following is a description of the major companies involved in the shuttle program, the tasks they have performed and the significance of the program to their financial outlook: **********Rockwell The Rockwell International Corporation not only was prime contractor for constructing the shuttles, but it also holds major contracts for providing ground support and building spare parts. The company earned about $3 billion for building the four operational shuttles, and it has said in the past that it would like to build another. **********In April 1983, Rockwell won a four-year contract worth about $400 million to construct major shuttle parts. These could be used either as replacements for the existing fleet or as components for another spacecraft. Rockwell is building the crew compartment, the forward fuselage, upper fuselage and payload bay doors, while it has subcontracted for General Dynamics to build the mid-fuselage, for Grumman to build wings and for Fairchild Industries and McDonnell Douglas to build other parts. **********Even when all of these parts are completed in 1987, it would take an additional two years and between $1 billion and $1.5 billion more to construct a new shuttle, Rockwell estimates. The reason is that none of the complex computer system and instrumentation is ready to be installed. **********Seven thousand Rockwell employees at a plant in Downey, Calif., near Los Angeles, work on the shuttle parts or on other, minor contracts to provide support for shuttle operations. In addition, 3,000 employees in Houston work on Rockwell's contract to supply ground support services to the Johnson Space Center there for the shuttle. **********That space center contract, which Rockwell won four months ago, will bring the company $685 million in the first four years, and up to $5.5 billion if it is extended to 14 years. The contract calls for Rockwell to assist in planning shuttle flights, developing computer software and training astronauts, among other operations. **********Worldwide, Rockwell has 120,000 employees. In its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, it earned $595.3 million on revenues of $11.34 billion. **********When a shuttle is under production, another Rockwell division builds the engines at a plant in Canoga Park, a Los Angeles suburb. In addition, between 50 and 100 Rockwell employees work at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral on projects related to the shuttle. **********Rockwell was also closely involved in the Apollo project. An accident in that program 19 years ago cost the lives of three astronauts. Rockwell, a major aerospace contractor also involved in the B-1 bomber and many other projects, built the Apollo module and provided ground support. The astronauts died in a fire while the craft, still on the ground, went through pre-launching procedures. The cause of the fire was never pinpointed. Nicholas D. Kristof **********Martin Marietta The space shuttle's huge external fuel tank, whose failure is regarded by many experts as a possible cause of Tuesday's disaster, was manufactured by the Martin Marietta Corporation. **********The shuttle program has brought the Denver-based aerospace company almost $2.6 billion in contracts from NASA since 1973. **********About 4,700 of the company's 60,000 employees are assigned to the shuttle project at Martin Marietta's Michoud Aerospace division in New Orleans. Most help to assemble the huge fuel tanks, which at liftoff contain more than 385,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and more than 140,000 gallons of liquid oxygen. **********The contracts cover research and development and the manufacture of 60 tanks. The company has already delivered 36 to NASA and 16 others are in various stages of assembly. **********Last week, the company reported 1985 earnings of $249.4 million on revenues of $4.4 billion. Its billings for the shuttle during the year totaled $380 million, or about 8 percent of sales. **********Martin Marietta is also the prime contractor for the Titan family of rocket boosters used by the Air Force to launch a variety of surveillance, reconnaissance and other military satellites. Until Tuesday, the space shuttle, which is reusable, was expected to take over more and more of the task of launching military satellites from these so-called expendable rockets, which would have meant fewer orders for Martin Marietta. Robert Lindsey **********Morton Thiokol The space shuttle program has become a major business for Morton Thiokol Inc., the nation's leading supplier of solid-fuel rocket systems. **********Space-related sales, most of which are tied to the shuttle program, accounted for about $380 million, or 44 percent, of the Chicago-based company's aerospace division revenues in the fiscal year that ended last June. **********The division, which also makes rocket propulsion for the Trident and MX missiles as well as smaller tactical weapons and satellites, in turn provided nearly half of Morton Thiokol's $1.83 billion in revenues and $198 million in net income in that year. **********The company declined to speculate on the future of the shuttle program and the impact of a possible shutdown or major delay. But Robert Bartels, who follows Morton Thiokol for William Blair & Company in Chicago, said that he had projected that the shuttle program would account for about 18 percent of the company's net income of $2.75 a share this year and 19.3 percent of earnings of $3.10 a share in the fiscal year 1987. **********Morton Thiokol has been involved in the shuttle program almost from its inception. It mixes fuels and pours them into containers, where they solidify, at a plant in Wasatch, Utah. The containers are then assembled with a nose cone and exit cone to make up the shuttle's solid fuel rockets. The plant also makes solid fuel rockets for strategic missiles. It employs a total of 6,500 workers. **********Company officials declined to say how many of the employees worked on the shuttle program specifically or what part of the investment at the Utah plant was entirely dependent on the shuttle program. **********''It's a substantial investment,'' said Thomas Russell, vice president for corporate development and strategic planning. ''It's no garage.'' **********The solid-fuel rockets used for the shuttle are recoverable. Morton Thiokol's contracts provide for refurbishing and reusing those that are recycled. It completed capital investments last year that prepared it to handle 24 shuttle flights a year. **********The company's Elkton, Md., division, makes the motors that lift communications satellites from the shuttle into higher orbits. Elkton has more than 500 employees. Barnaby J. Feder **********Lockheed The Lockheed Corporation's activities related to the space shuttle comprise only a small percentage of the company's total revenues, which analysts expect to exceed $9 billion in 1985. **********Lockheed's biggest involvement is as the lead contractor servicing the shuttles between flights. This task includes cleaning, maintaining and testing the shuttles and preparing them for launch. Lockheed has about 7,000 employees involved in this function, about 5,000 at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and about 2,000 at the Vandenberg Air Force Base near Santa Barbara, Calif., according to Harold Hurlocker, a spokesman for Lockheed. The company, which is based in Burbank, Calif., has a total of 87,000 employees. **********The company was awarded a three-year contract for this function beginning in 1984, but the contract can be extended for as much as 12 more years. The company and analysts said the contract is worth about $400 million a year, although some of this is paid out to three other companies involved in the work - Grumman, Morton-Thiokol and Pan American World Airways. **********The Lockheed Missile and Space Company, a division located in Sunnyvale, Calif., has several contracts that could be affected by any halt or change in the space program. The main one is for the integration and testing of the Hubble Space Telescope that NASA had hoped to place in orbit using the shuttle in October. Lockheed's contract is for about $400 million and the task involves 400 people out of the 25,000 employed in the missiles and space division. **********The division, the largest employer in Silicon Valley, also built the heat protection tiles for the shuttle and has been involved in various scientific experiments. The missile and space division is also a subcontractor to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation for preliminary studies and work on a proposed manned space station, a project that could be affected if NASA decides to de-emphasize manned space flights as a result of the Challenger accident. **********Mr. Hurlocker of Lockheed said it was too early to assess the effects of the shuttle explosion on the company. Analysts expected it to be small. ''I don't think it's going to be significant,'' said Sarah Stack, analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richard Inc. in Los Angeles, who said that even if the total ground service contract was lost, it would still amount to only 3 percent of Lockheed's total revenues. Andrew Pollack **********Grumman The Grumman Corporation's contracts relating to the shuttle program are nearing completion and are therefore not likely to be affected significantly by the shuttle disaster or any resultant cutbacks in the program. **********Grumman's involvement is in three areas, according to a company spokesman, Brian Salisbury. **********At its Bethpage, L.I., plant, the company has built the wings for the shuttle fleet with an employee force of about 140. The first set of two wings was delivered in May 1975; the sixth and last set will be delivered this December. The first set was for the Enterprise, the shuttle used in atmospheric flight tests but never intended for orbit. The others were for the four orbiters in the program. The sixth is a backup set that could go on the fifth orbiter, which has long been pushed by NASA but never authorized. The total value of the wings production contracts was $206 million. **********The company's Technical Services division in Titusville, Fla., near the Kennedy Space Center, has 1,100 employees and a six-year contract, worth $40 million a year, that was let in October 1983. The division's primary purpose is to maintain and operate about 300 on-the-ground computers used in helping get the shuttle ready for launch. Grumman is a subcontractor on the computer program to Lockheed's Space Operations division. **********The division head is Fred W. Haise Jr., a former astronaut who flew on the Apollo 13 flight that almost ended in disaster when an oxygen tank exploded as the spacecraft neared the moon. The moon landing had to be canceled. **********Grumman also has between $7 million and $8 million of contracts for on-board shuttle experiments. Many of these have to do with the developing systems for the space-station program. Specifically, one has to do with thermal-system technology, one with robotics and one with experimental radar. There are fewer than 20 employees involved in these payload projects. **********Grumman has 30,900 employees over all. In the nine months ended Sept 30, it earned $58.4 million on revenues of $2.27 billion. **********Richard Witkin"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/15/business/finance-new-issues-panama-canal-picks-advisers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Panama Canal Picks Advisers", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Panama Canal Picks Advisers", "body_text": " **********Bear Stearns Companies Inc. announced yesterday that it had been appointed by the Panama Canal Commission to study the financing needed to widen part of the canal.

LAWYERS", "print_headline": "THE RUSH TO HIRE L.A. LAWYERS", "body_text": " **********ANTHONY J. ONCIDI, a young associate at a Los Angeles law firm, received a tantalizing telephone call the other day. A ''headhunter'' asked if he was interested in moving four blocks to the rapidly expanding Los Angeles branch of a New York law firm, for a 50 percent pay increase to $90,000. **********''It was very seductive,'' Mr. Oncidi recalled. ''It's easy to be dazzled.'' But he decided that he was happy at his current firm, Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton, and he thought his chances of becoming a partner were not as good at the New York-based firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. He also assumed he would have to work many more hours if he switched jobs. So he declined. **********Someone else will take the job. New York law firms are streaming into Los Angeles these days, snatching away partners and associates from local firms with juicy wage hikes. At least 37 New York law firms have opened offices in Los Angeles, mostly in the past few years and many of them within the last 12 months. **********This rush into Los Angeles reflects the city's emergence as a growing financial center, eclipsing San Francisco as America's gateway to Asia. Not only law firms, but investment banks and commercial banks have been opening offices in Los Angeles, attracted by a powerful and diverse local economy and by growing links with Japan and China - all of which is making Los Angeles in many respects the nation's second city in commerce and finance. In 1970, when a young lawyer named Michael H. Diamond was a summer associate at a Los Angeles law firm, he decided to practice in New York instead. ''I wanted to be a business lawyer, and I didn't see any business here,'' he said. Now Mr. Diamond is back in Los Angeles, as managing director of the Skadden, Arps branch. **********The move to Los Angeles by New York firms also reflects the trend toward national law firms. Some attorneys predict that law will follow the path of accounting, with a small top tier of giant national firms, each with offices in a number of cities, and then a multitude of smaller, single-city firms. This is not the first expansion of America's major law firms. Just after World War II, many set up offices in Washington to handle work with the regulatory agencies. More recently, the expansion has been less coherent, with some firms establishing offices in Atlanta or San Francisco, and others in Houston or Miami. Los Angeles, however, is fast becoming a ''must'' branch for a law firm aspiring to national status. **********The battle to staff these branches with Los Angeles lawyers has upset tradition. Once a local lawyer was expected to spend his entire career at the same firm, but now even the most senior of partners have been wooed away by other firms with extravagant pay packages and sometimes more interesting work. **********Skadden, Arps has been among the most aggressive in luring local talent, in the process of growing from a dozen lawyers when the Los Angeles office opened three years ago to about 65 today. Mr. Diamond said he expects to add another 10 or 15 by year's end, and 20 or 30 next year. **********Among the recent additions are Frank Rothman, who was a top partner at a local firm and until recently chief executive of the MGM/UA Entertainment Company; Richard S. Volpert, one of the most senior partners at O'Melveny & Myers, a top Los Angeles firm; John A. Donovan, who headed the Los Angeles office of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, a New York firm, and William A. Masterson, who formerly ran the Los Angeles office of Rogers & Wells, another New York firm. **********''The number of lawyers going from firm to firm is incredible,'' said Reade H. Ryan Jr., partner in charge of the Los Angeles office of Shearman & Sterling, a top New York firm. Mr. Ryan snatched two partners, William M. Burke and Ronald M. Bayer, from Sheppard, Mullin. Shearman & Sterling's Los Angeles office opened with 5 lawyers a year ago and now has 14. **********New York firms like to hire established local lawyers because of their familiarity with California law and business, and because of their relationships with local clients. Grabbing a prominent local lawyer also brings instant visibility and prestige to a new office. Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, for example, this year hired Charles E. Rickershauser Jr., a former top partner at a local firm, to head its new Los Angeles office. Fried, Frank has just three lawyers there, but Mr. Rickershauser says he has space for 16 more. **********SOME salaries appear to be swelling as a result of the competition for top lawyers. A few partners of Los Angeles firms reportedly have increased their annual earnings by several hundred thousand dollars by moving to branches of New York firms. And many firms are raising compensation scales for associates by $10,000 or more to keep up with similar increases in New York. **********New York firms like Shearman & Sterling and Skadden, Arps are paying the same sum - $67,000 - to first- year associates, whether they work in New York or Los Angeles. On the other hand, Los Angeles firms like Gibson, Dunn and O'Melveny & Myers pay less in Los Angeles than in New York. O'Melveny, for example, is paying new lawyers $65,000 in New York, but $52,000 in Los Angeles. The salary shakeout is still under way, however, and policies may change in the next few years. **********A few experts predict that the sufferers in the salary struggle will not be the biggest and best indigenous firms, but a second tier that lacks the specialties and skills of the best-known firms. ''Maybe there is a 40-year-old lawyer who is making $150,000 or $200,000 at an L.A. firm,'' said Jeffrey M. Abell, co-owner of a Los Angeles legal recruiting firm. ''Maybe now he can get $300,000 elsewhere if he brings in lots of business.'' Such inducements seem to be working: Mr. Abell has found new jobs for 6 Los Angeles partners this year. While New York firms are drawn to Los Angeles because of its economic growth, they also are contributing to the sense of sophistication that makes it easier to convince young lawyers that Los Angeles is as good as New York for building a career. Michael V. Gisser, a 29-year-old gruduate of Harvard College and Stanford Law School, is one of those who was convinced. He left the Manhattan office of a New York firm this summer to join the Los Angeles office of Skadden, Arps as an associate, in part because he believed that Southern California would provide as sophisticated a practice as New York. **********''Besides, I bought a beautiful car and I made an offer on a house,'' Mr. Gisser added. Instead of commuting by subway from his studio apartment, as he did in Manhattan, Mr. Gisser will commute in his red convertible from the two-bedroom house he is buying in the Hollywood Hills. He also plans to install a hot tub.  The migrant law firms are arriving not only from New York. About 14 firms from other cities - including Houston, Washington and Chicago -also have set up shop in Los Angeles. A giant Cleveland firm, Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, has about 85 lawyers here and is expanding. ''I wouldn't be surprised to see us have 150 to 225 lawyers in the L.A. area,'' said Girard E. Boudreau Jr., the managing partner, who was recruited last year from O'Melveny & Myers. **********Hughes, Hubbard & Reed may have been the first large Eastern firm to open a branch in Los Angeles. It arrived in 1972, following the shift in the headquarters of its client, the Atlantic Richfield Company. But the trickle of firms into Los Angeles accelerated in recent years and became a flood over the last year or so. Lawyers say it is likely to last several more years at least. **********No one seems very sure what the consequences will be of this incoming tide of law firms. But for the moment, most Los Angeles firms claim they have not been hurt. **********''We don't yet see any discernible effect on our client relationships,'' said Warren Christopher, the former State Department official who now is managing partner of O'Melveny & Myers. ''This is the best year in our history, and we're exceeding our projections.'' While Shearman & Sterling, which is Citicorp's principal law firm in New York, has moved into an office in the new Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles, and is doing some work for Citicorp on the West Coast, Mr. Christopher said that O'Melveny & Myers is doing as much business as ever for Citicorp. **********The suggestion by some New York lawyers that they are more capable and harder working than their California brethren raises hackles at local law firms. ''It would be sales puffery to suggest that New York law firms have any higher degree of sophistication than L.A. law firms,'' said Norman B. Barker, chairman of the management committee at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Southern California's biggest law firm. **********California companies are likely to benefit from the increased competition among law firms. ''From a client's perspective it gives greater access to legal services,'' Russell A. Freeman, general counsel of the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, said of the arrival of New York firms. Security Pacific gives business to about a dozen firms in Los Angeles, including Shearman & Sterling. **********The competition in law parallels the battles in banking in Los Angeles. The beneficiaries of Los Angeles's rise as a financial center ironically have often been New York-based institutions. The principal investment banks in Southern California, for example, are not indigenous, but branches of Wall Street houses like the First Boston Corporation and Morgan Stanley. And while New York commercial banks still are not allowed to do business with California consumers, institutions like Citibank and Chase Manhattan are very aggressive in luring business clients."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/24/world/libyan-aides-order-200-reporters-out-then-change-mind.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 330, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LIBYAN AIDES ORDER 200 REPORTERS OUT, THEN CHANGE MIND", "print_headline": "LIBYAN AIDES ORDER 200 REPORTERS OUT, THEN CHANGE MIND", "body_text": " **********Libyan officials today ordered more than 200 foreign journalists to leave the country.

You can't control the actions of management,'' shrugs John Collins, an administrative vice president of the U.A.W. **********Like Deere, more and more companies are adopting the lockout tactic to force further concessions from giveback-weary unions. The lockouts, which occur when management refuses to let union members continue to work under current contract conditions, are the latest in a series of setbacks for labor. Collective bargaining contracts are averaging increases of only 1.5 percent and union membership is dwindling nationwide. **********Many tough, once-untouchable unions - the United Steelworkers; the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers and the Transport Workers Union - are currently targets of management lockouts. And it was a threatened lockout that last week prompted the International Longshoremen's Association to strike for three days. The shipping industry offered to let the New York dock employees work under an expired contract, but refused the same privilege to workers at other Northeastern ports. **********The New York union, faced with the no-win choice of striking or of working while its East Coast compatriots were locked out, chose to strike the entire region. As the stunned union scrambled to print picket signs, management boasted it was loading the luxury liner QE2 in record time without the workers. The longshoremen returned after the shippers extended the contracts until Nov. 17. **********Businesses are often able to function during a lockout, using management and non-union employees. Now the National Labor Relations Board has strengthened the lockout as a tactic with a July ruling that allows companies to keep operating by hiring temporary replacement workers. ''That's a fairly potent weapon,'' said Richard Briffault, a labor specialist at the Columbia Law School. THE Federal Government keeps no tabs on lockouts, which are lumped together with strikes in the statistics on labor disputes. In fact, labor, management and state employment officials often disagree about when to apply the label to an individual dispute. But labor officials say the current lockout level is unprecedented in the post-World War II era. The USX lockout of the United Steelworkers and the Deere dispute alone have idled 35,000 workers. ''The magnitude of these overshadows anything that's happened since the 1930's,'' said Rudy Oswald, economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''A lot of people will be looking at the outcome.'' **********That is especially true of other companies in financially pressed industries - farm equipment, airlines and petroleum, for example - that are seeking any cure for their hardship. ''Some of these industries are under the most economic pressure they have felt since the Depression,'' said Robert Flanagan, professor of labor relations at Stanford University's graduate business school. ''We shouldn't be surprised to see the extreme forms of behavior associated with the Depression. It's a way of signaling the union how serious they are about their economic difficulty.'' **********But lockouts, like other super-aggressive tactics against labor, may not be a panacea for companies' troubles. Managements pay a stiff price for such behavior, labor experts say. At USX, the takeover sharks began circling the company soon after the steel mills shut down on Aug. 1. After investors heard from analysts that the action was costing USX $100 million a month, many unloaded their shares and sent the price tumbling. **********The tactic also may be forcing insecure unions to the wall. Under the worst circumstances, two stubborn sides may fight to the death. ''Both sides have to recognize that some concessions are necessary or the doors are going to shut forever,'' says James Knepper Jr., Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, referring to the acrimonious 60-day-old dispute at USX. STILL, many companies, frustrated by two years of stagnant earnings, are attracted to the cost-saving tactic as a way of bolstering sagging profits. ''It was an awakening to realize we had 25 percent excess manning because of our labor agreement,'' said William Jenkins, vice president for human resources at BASF. ''That's an interesting lesson for industry.'' **********BASF began its lockout of about 400 members of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union at its Gulf Coast plant two years ago, when the petrochemicals business was deep in the doldrums. Management asked for an eight-month freeze on worker pay, wanted workers to pay a greater share of their health-care premiums and wanted permission from the union to hire more maintenance workers from outside the company. **********When the two sides did not reach an agreement by the June 1984 contract deadline, BASF locked out the workers and hired temporary replacements. Negotiations with the union continue, but the plant is running at full capacity with 100 fewer workers, Mr. Jenkins says. **********Other companies, too, are succumbing to the lure of lockouts. In December, Macromedia Publishing in New Jersey cancelled the contract of members of the militant Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union when the Hackensack company bought the New Tribune. Last summer, Sundstrand, a Rockford, Ill. maker of aerospace and industrial components, locked out the U.A.W., allowing them back only after they agreed to accept reduced medical benefits. **********Until a few years ago, such behavior by business was rare. In fact, management's use of the lockout as an offensive weapon was once banned under the 1935 Labor Relations Act, and the practice almost disappeared. The law allowed the tactic to be used only in cases where one union bargained simultaneously with several companies. If the union struck one of those companies, then the others could legally lock out the union members. **********Then, in 1964, the American Ship Building Company won a Supreme Court decision allowing it to use the lockout offensively against its unions in a bitter dispute at its Ohio yards. But lockouts were rarely used in the environment of powerful unions that lasted through the 1970's. **********But the strengthening dollar, accompanied by surging imports and a persistently high unemployment rate, changed all that. Companies began to demand concessions from workers in order to remain competitive in world markets. And when employees eventually balked at granting further give-backs, many managers started turning to the lockout. **********Now, even small companies are confronting tough unions with the tactic. Last month, for example, Brooklyn Union Gas locked out 2,330 clerks and mechanics in the Transport Workers Union before they had a chance to strike. The union had voted 20 to 1 against a new three-year contract of givebacks. Workers are still walking the picket lines as management employees read meters and descend into manholes. ''We have a policy at this company - no contract, no work,'' said William Federici, a Brooklyn Union spokesman. **********That is becoming a management refrain. ''What we're seeing is role reversal,'' says Mr. Knepper of the Pennsylvania Labor Department. ''Organized labor now represents the status quo. They're fighting to keep from giving up anything. And management is no longer negotiating just to give up as little as possible; they're actually demanding concessions.'' UNIONS, caught off guard by the changes and besieged at the same time by a spate of contract cancellations from bankruptcies, leveraged buyouts and takeovers, are improvising rather slowly in their reversed role. **********One problem, labor experts say, is that older union members are often reluctant to recognize that new economic realities have drastically altered the labor-management game. They insist on believing that many troubled mangements are simply crying wolf or pursuing some hidden agenda when they ask for concessions. This makes it harder for union leaders to grant more givebacks. **********Deere is a case in point. Despite heavy losses in recent years and the continuing depression in the farm belt, Deere workers insist that the company has orchestrated the lockout to trim its bulging inventories. And because things have always been done that way, they say, Deere should sign the same contract that by Caterpillar signed. Deere wants more flexibility on cost-of-living increases, work rules and medical benefits, contending that Caterpillar - which makes earth-moving equipment -can afford more because of the robust recovery in the construction business. **********It was Deere's refusal to follow the Cat pattern that spurred a U.A.W. walk-off at three strategic plants. The union instructed its members to report for work at 10 other plants, but Deere, taking the position that a strike against the three was a strike against all, shut its gates to union members for the first time in its 149-year history. It is holding out for concessions that would all but eliminate the cost-of-living pay adjustments and substantially change work rules. **********Internal union politics may also be contributing to the rise in management-initiated lockouts. The president of Local 101 of the Transport Workers Union, which represents workers at Brooklyn Union Gas, was voted out of office a year and a half ago when concessions under the now-expired contract became a hot issue. James Murray, who ousted the past president, says the same fate would await him if he agreed to the latest menu of concessions sought by management. ''The membership will vote out any person or team of people who cave in to these givebacks,'' he said. **********Lacking a grand strategy to defeat the lockouts, labor has resorted with limited success to the familiar tactic of applying political pressure. In Illinois, the issue of unemployment compensation for the idle Deere workers has become part of the heated gubernatorial race between Gov. James Thompson and Adlai Stevenson. **********In other disputes unions are going to court and Congress - with mixed results. But increasingly, they are turning to public appeals and alleging menaces to public safety. The oil workers waged a spirited corporate campaign against BASF, for example, charging that its plant was unsafe because the company used unskilled workers. The Louisiana plant was accused by the union of having the same potential for disaster as the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India. **********BASF's Mr. Jenkins says it has taken a lot of management time to respond to inquiries about the charges. But, he said, ''in terms of business, sales and efficiency of the site, it's had no effect.'' **********Some union leaders admit openly that their salvation may rely on an industrial accident. ''Management can't police the system; a secretary can't go out on the line and look for a gas leak,'' said Mr. Murray, head of the union locked out by the Brooklyn utility. ''Somebody may have to get hurt to prove our point.'' WHERE 'SCAB' HASLOST ITS STING It was like a scene from the labor movement's heyday at the Brooklyn Union Gas plant a few weeks ago in the Grasmere section of Staten Island. Pickets from the Transport Workers Union - who have been locked out of the company's Brooklyn and Queens plants - roundly jeered those working at the plant, members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, for crossing the picket line. When two T.W.U. officials prostrated themselves in front of exiting trucks, squadrons of New York City police - some on horseback, a few with ready clubs - moved in and carted them off. **********Yet more than 230 of the I.B.E.W. members report to work daily. In New York's small-town-in-residence, where white steepled churches dominate hilltops and the Knights of Columbus solicits at traffic lights for retarded children, the term ''scab'' has lost it sting. The devotion to traditional values no longer includes automatic respect for the sanctity of the picket sign. **********The Staten Island situation is symptomatic of the dilemma facing organized labor. ''They come in here and throw rocks at us and call us scabs,'' said John Pumilia, a technician and I.B.E.W. official. ''But we don't have a vendetta against them. I have a wife. I have two kids. I have a mortgage.'' **********Brooklyn Union has kept its I.B.E.W. workers on the job in Staten Island by demanding fewer givebacks from them and by inserting a ''me-too'' clause in their contract, meaning they will get whatever the T.W.U. gets. This has aggravated the long competition between the two unions. And longtime ethnic rivalries within the unions have surfaced with the company's demands that the largely Irish white-collar clerical employees in the T.W.U. increase their working week to 40 hours from 37 1/2 - the same as the largely Italian blue-collar force of the I.B.E.W. **********The company also gave I.B.E.W. members some overtime pay on the day of the big confrontation in Staten Island and allowed them to come in through a back entrance. **********''We have a signed contract; it's one of the best contracts around for the year 1986,'' said George Rondinelli, the local union chairman, justifying the I.B.E.W.'s stand to continue working during the lockout at the other plants. ''As free Americans, we can make that decision.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/09/business/icahn-offer-complicates-labor-dispute-at-usx.html": {"writer_name": "William Serrin", "pub_date": "1986-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ICAHN OFFER COMPLICATES LABOR DISPUTE AT USX", "print_headline": "ICAHN OFFER COMPLICATES LABOR DISPUTE AT USX", "body_text": " **********The effort by Carl C. Icahn to acquire the USX Corpororation adds more complexity to the work shutdown at USX, a bitter confrontation now in its third month. **********Among those who are watching the situation are some who feel that Mr. Icahn might, from the view of the United Steelworkers of America, be more reasonable to deal with than David M. Roderick, USX chairman. **********Mr. Icahn said in an interview that if he gained control, he would attempt to work out an arrangement with the union to end the shutdown, perhaps exchanging concessions for a profit-sharing plan. Some Wary of Flirting With Icahn **********The other view is that the bid will have little effect and that the union should beware of the consequences of flirting with Mr. Icahn because even though at first he might appear more willing than Mr. Roderick to make a deal, that might not be the case at all. **********In any case, Mr. Roderick is tough and will do what he can to avoid a takeover, observers say, and if he fends off the bid, they say, he will continue to fight for substantial concessions from the union. **********Some observers also think USX might now decide that it should reach an agreement with the union preparatory to spinning off its steel operations as a response to Mr. Icahn's bid. There has long been speculation that USX might want to get out of steel production, although the company has denied this. **********Mr. Icahn, after an extended takeover fight in 1985, gained control of Trans World Airlines through concessions and a profit-sharing arrangement supported by the T.W.A. pilots'and machinists' unions. Establishing Communication **********Communication between Mr. Icahn and the steelworkers could be easily established. For example, Lazard Freres & Company, the New York investment house, which assisted unions in Mr. Icahn's T.W.A. takeover bid, has done extensive work in the steel industry. **********But those who are wary, from a labor viewpoint, of Mr. Icahn's bid point to the nine-week strike earlier this year by the T.W.A. flight attendants. Their union eventually capitulated, but not before more than 4,000 attendants had lost their jobs. For his part, Mr. Icahn said that T.W.A., which is now profitable, was saved from bankruptcy and that the flight attendants could have avoided their job losses by agreeing to the same sort of concessions accepted by pilots and machinists. **********The USX shutdown has received little attention since its first days. That, said Robert Crandall, an industry analyst at the Brookings Institution, demonstrates ''how much the world has changed since 1959.'' That was the year of the last national steel strike, which saw 500,000 workers walk out at 11 companies for 116 days. **********This time, the walkout involves one company and 22,000 steelworkers. Still, USX is the nation's leading steel producer and has long been considered a premier American industrial company. No bargaining has occurred since the stoppage began on Aug. 1. 'Fascinating and Complex' **********Even though public attention has been scant, Ben Fischer, director of the Center for Labor Studies at Carnegie-Mellon University, calls the shutdown ''fascinating and complex.'' **********The union has set up an extensive communications network with its USX members and is asking consumers to boycott products of Marathon Oil, a USX energy company. **********USX is communicating directly with workers, bypassing the union, and is fighting union efforts to have the shutdown declared a lockout by state labor agencies. Such rulings let workers receive unemployment compensation. The union says that in four of nine states, the shutdown has been declared a lockout, which means it was presumed that the company caused the work stoppage, and a majority of idled workers are receiving unemployment benefits. **********The company has also angered workers by trying to ship stockpiled steel from picketed plants. Some workers also are vexed because of the continued operation of a Pittsburg, Calif., plant. That plant, a joint venture of USX and South Korea's Pohang Iron and Steel Company, is running under a contract extension agreed to by the union's regional officers and USX. Quick Settlement Called Unlikely **********Despite the takeover developments, various factors indicate that a quick settlement is unlikely. **********Unemployment compensation can exceed $200 a week, making it possible for steelworkers to continue house and car payments. The union is paying idled workers as much as $60 a week in benefits and has set up a medical insurance plan. **********Many workers believe they have little to lose by continuing the fight. They contend that plant closings and job cuts will continue even if the workers agree to concessions on wages and benefits. **********Charles A. Bradford, an industry analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, believes that ultimately under Mr. Roderick, if he retains control of the company, only two steel plants -at Gary, Ind., and Fairfield, Ala., -will be kept in operation of the eight or so major USX steel facilities. Company Seeks Concessions **********USX says it needs deep concessions. The company's contract proposal that workers rejected called for concessions of $3 to $3.50 an hour in wages and benefits, including a reduction of at least $1.25 from average direct wages that the union places at $12.28 an hour. Mr. Bradford said USX wants a reduction in grievances, increased authority to transfer workers when plants close and fewer subcontracting restrictions. **********In an August letter to idled workers, J. Bruce Johnston, USX executive vice president for employee relations, said, ''The union hierarchy has put you on strike in spite of a wage and benefit offer that would have totaled over $23 an hour.'' **********Michael Locker of New York, a private consultant who works with the steelworkers' union, said recently that he thought no meaningful negotiations in the work stoppage would occur until USX ''unloads the whole'' steelmaking division. ''Then there will be somebody else sitting at the table,'' he said. **********Nevertheless, there was no speculation by analysts, USX or the union that Mr. Icahn would not have made the bid if the shutdown did not exist. **********It is a measure of the bitterness and divergent views in the shutdown and of the current dim settlement possibilities, a labor expert said, that the union might consider whether it could gain a better settlement from Mr. Icahn than Mr. Roderick. **********Mr. Icahn said he should not be regarded as callous toward workers and communities. **********He said he believed that without him, T.W.A. would be bankrupt and noted that he had sold off no significant pieces of T.W.A. He also said that ACF Industries, which he acquired in 1983, has harmonious relations with its union workers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/27/business/patents-instrument-measures-nuclear-radiation.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1986-12-27", "snippet": "An instrument that measures radiation, particularly nuclear radiation, was patented this week by three specialists.", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PATENTS;\nInstrument Measures Nuclear Radiation", "print_headline": "PATENTS;\nInstrument Measures Nuclear Radiation", "body_text": " **********An instrument that measures radiation, particularly nuclear radiation, was patented this week by three specialists. **********It is now being manufactured by Far West Technology Inc. in Goleta, Calif. **********The inventors are Stanley Kronenberg of the Army Electronics and Communications Command at Fort Monmouth, N.J.; William L.

He avoided direct answers to questions about whether he would go to the Yasukuni facility again. **********The issue, while essentially one of symbolism, has proved to be a lingering embarrassment for Mr. Nakasone, straining relations with China and costing him support among Japanese. He and his advisers have looked hard for ways to extricate themselves from the controversy, but without success. #2.5 Million War Dead The Yasukuni Shrine, just north of the Imperial Palace grounds in central Tokyo, honors the spirits of nearly 2.5 million Japanese servicemen who gave their lives for their country in the last century. Until 1945 it was the center of State Shintoism, now banned under an American-imposed Constitution that mandates separation of church and state. **********Most of the people honored there were in World War II. In 1978, however, Yasukuni priests quietly enshrined 14 men convicted and, in some cases executed, as war criminals; they included Japan's Prime Minister in the early 1940's, Hideki Tojo. **********Last Aug. 15, on the 40th anniversary of Japan's surrender, Mr. Nakasone inflamed the issue by becoming the first postwar Prime Minister to make an official visit to Yasukuni. In current political debate, officials who go to the shrine find themselves accused as militarists by anti-Government critics. **********Mr. Nakasone, a strong nationalist, has defended his action as ''only natural to pay homage to those who fought for their country and fell in the war.'' But he underestimated the strong emotions that his visit would arouse. Criticism from China **********China has maintained a tattoo of protest, including a charge by the official press agency that the Prime Minister had ''pandered'' to Japanese wanting to deny their country's guilt during World War II. **********Some Japanese politicians regard the Chinese complaints as a ploy to extract economic favors from the Nakasone Government. On the subject of its wartime behavior, however, Japan has long been sensitive to attacks from other Asian countries, especially China. **********Mr. Nakasone tried in vain to end the dispute by canceling a scheduled trip to the shrine last October. Since then, he has focused on a possible face-saving compromise, attempting to placate the Chinese by removing the 14 convicted war criminals from Yasukuni. **********Japanese newspapers reported this week that a group of lawmakers from the governing Liberal Democratic Party had urged senior priests to set up a new shrine for for Tojo and the others somewhere else. Yasukuni officials flatly rejected the idea, it was reported. Protests From Families **********Besides antagonizing China, Mr. Nakasone has offended some relatives of the war dead.

No Time for Confrontation **********''The question of Daniloff and Zakharov has been resolved successfully in the interests of both sides,'' Mr. Pyadyshev said.

Preliminary Gathering **********Mr. Baker addressed the I.M.F.'s policy-making Interim Committee, one of a series of preliminary gatherings before the address by President Reagan Tuesday morning that kicks off the annual meeting. **********He warned, as he has in the past, that there was a potential threat of more protectionism in this country that could become a major political issue. The Treasury chief also signaled American intentions to keep the pressure on Germany and Japan to cut rates or take other action to spur growth, despite protests that they are already doing as much as possible, consistent with holding inflation in check. **********Bonn and Tokyo maintain that the United States should be doing much more to curb its budget deficit. **********But a top West German banker, Dr. Walter Seipp, chairman of the Commerzbank, said, ''I do believe there is some room for lowering key interest rates in Germany'' and added that he would take a bet that the Bundesbank, the German central bank, would act within the next month. 'Reasonable' Dollar Level Cited **********Dr. Seipp said, however, that any further cuts in interest rates should be linked to an international ''understanding that the present level of the dollar is reasonable.'' **********Long an opponent of fixed exchange rates, Gerhard Stoltenberg, West Germany's Finance Minister, told reporters that he too now favored more currency predictability. For the first time, he said he would be willing to enter into talks about target zones. **********Under the target zone system, governments would take market action to keep their currencies within certain broad, prescribed limits. Against large buying or selling, governments would simply permit their currencies to move within a new range. **********The new talk about greater currency stability reflects the growing pressure the German and Japanese officials are under from their exporters, whose products are made less competitive by the stronger mark and yen.

They said Saturday that they could make no decisions on either currency or interest rate policies, but did pledge in a communique to ''work more closely'' together. **********Concern over slowing economies was intensified today with publication of the I.M.F.'s semiannual World Economic Outlook, which cut back its 1986 growth forecast for the industrial world to 3.1 percent, from 3.3 percent projected last April. **********Because there had been some expectation of agreements being reached, most bankers interviewed here said they felt the dollar would decline Monday and that bond markets would open weakly. **********''The markets will react negatively,'' said Robert D.

The Churchill tome was preceded by ''The Holocaust,'' an 828-page chronicle of the Nazi effort to exterminate Europe's Jews that in the estimation of The Times Literary Supplement, ''is likely to remain the standard history.'' **********And that was preceded, by only a few weeks, by the publication of a 412-page biography of Anatoly Shcharansky, the jailed campaigner for the rights of Soviet Jews who was finally freed and allowed to leave Russia early this year. Writing to Soviet Jews **********Prodigious as that sounds, it is not the whole story. The historian's published output is nearly matched by a vast private correspondence he maintains with Jews in Leningrad and Moscow who have been denied exit visas. **********A tidy archivist who has published eight volumes of Churchill documents to accompany his biography, Mr. Gilbert keeps his correspondence with Soviet Jews in one of the three desks in the study where he does his writing at his home near Parliament Hill in the Hampstead district of London. **********In a week in which he launched the latest Churchill volume and introduced Mr. Shcharansky to a rapturous crowd of 5,000 at the Royal Albert Hall - an experience he described as ''certainly the climax of my life'' -he also found time to send the 1,118th letter he has written in the last three years in a personal campaign to buoy the spirits of Jews he met on his two visits to the Soviet Union. **********That campaign has earned him what he considers an honor, a branding as a ''Zionist functionary'' by a Soviet court. And it is evident that his friends among those who seek to emigrate buoy his spirits as well. Their pictures are arrayed on shelves near the desk where he writes, and he recognizes a debt, as well as advertises their demand for release, by dedicating his books to them. The gesture must puzzle old-style British Tories who dip into his Churchill. The latest volume is dedicated to a Moscow teacher of Hebrew, Michael Kholmiansky, and his wife Ilana. A Complicated Tapestry **********There are moments when the threads of Mr. Gilbert's various endeavors and concerns seem part of a complicated pattern in the same tapestry. ''Road to Victory,'' for instance, covers the period from 1941 to 1945, the same years that frame the narrative of ''The Holocaust.'' Doing his research, the author found himself simultaneously concerned with the struggle for survival of the Warsaw Ghetto in September 1942 and Churchill's discovery that same month of the extent of the Nazi campaign against the Jews. **********There is even a sense in which Winston Churchill can be viewed as the author of his biographer's Zionism. Mr. Gilbert, now several weeks away from his 50th birthday, was ''neither anti-Israel nor pro-Israel,'' he says, when as a young Oxford don he was engaged to take the place of Randolph Churchill, who died after completing the first two volumes of his father's biography. A Dramatic Moment in Israel **********Mr. Gilbert had already published the third volume, the first to bear his name, when his research on Churchill's handling of the Palestine question during his tenure as Colonial Secretary in 1921 led the historian to take his first trip to Israel. He went back for a second trip, arriving just in time for the 1973 Middle East war. **********The scholarly interest then became intensely personal, to the point that the ever-lengthening inventory of Mr. Gilbert's books now includes five atlases concerned with aspects of the Jewish past and present as well as a history of Jerusalem in the 19th century. **********Reviewers guess wrong when they imagine that Mr. Gilbert's stupendous output owes something to the invention of the silicon chip. His fingers perform no glissades on the keyboard of a word processor. He has not even contemplated installing one in his study, preferring to do all his writing with fountain pens in bound notebooks. 'The Flow of Ink' **********''I've always liked the flow of ink,'' he said in a conversation the other morning, holding up the notebook in which he had been writing the latest chapter in the eighth and final Churchill volume, which he hopes to finish next year. On a good 12-hour day, he fills 40 to 50 pages. **********It only seems that he writes several books at once. In fact, he says, he writes them one at a time. ''The Holocaust,'' which he describes as the culmination of 25 years of research and interviewing, was written between Volumes 6 and 7 of the Churchill. ''Shcharansky: Hero of Our Time'' was written after Volume 7, in only a month, being what its author calls ''an action book,'' one intended as a salvo in the campaign for its subject's release. **********The critical reception of Mr. Gilbert's books veers between admiration for his mastery of sources and awe for his industry. The terms ''monumental'' and ''magisterial'' recur in description of the Churchill biography. But occasionally reviewers carp about the self-denial Mr. Gilbert brings to his practice of the historian's craft. His narratives are rigorously chronological, full of quotations from original sources, the flow of which is seldom interrupted by the narrator stepping forward to portray character or interpret events in his own voice. An Appetite for Fact **********Another Oxford historian, Norman Stone, complained in separate reviews of Mr. Gilbert's last two books that their author's appetite for fact far outstripped his taste for interpretation. Reviewing ''The Holocaust,'' Professor Stone wrote, ''Virtually every time a thought occurs beyond the earliest stage of development, it is swamped by another wave of atrocities.'' The same reviewer faulted ''Road to Victory'' for its author's disinclination to deal directly with criticisms of Churchill. **********But Professor Stone has also written that Mr. Gilbert deserves a knighthood and a stipend from Parliament ''for devoting so much of his working life to this national monument.'' **********Mr. Gilbert makes no apologies for his method. ''Chronology is the key to understanding everything,'' he said. ''I regard the term 'chronicler' as the highest praise.'' **********Interpretation is implicit, he maintains, in the selection of sources and quotations from the welter of all that is available. He also doesn't feel that he was at a disadvantage in writing ''Road to Victory'' in having to compete with Churchill's own six-volume history of World War II. Calculation, Not Inspiration **********Churchill, he notes, did not have access to the full public record when he wrote, nor was he then free to acknowledge that British intelligence had broken German codes, allowing him to make decisions usually with Ultra, as the decoded Nazi messages were known, available to guide him. What was in fact a calculation on the basis of intelligence, Mr. Gilbert says, is often presented as inspiration in Churchill's memoirs. **********One-third of the way through the final volume, he can now look forward to parting with his subject. But even as Churchill approaches his dotage, his wit and profundity continue to surprise his biographer, who had to grope for an answer when asked if there was a side to the man he disliked. **********Eventually he hit on Churchill's vainglorious self-promotion, but it was something he readily forgave. ''When you enter under somebody's skin,'' he said, ''you just chuckle when you find he's being a little mischievous.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/25/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " *********** American Express Travel Related Services Co., a subsidiary of the American Express Co., has named Kenneth I.

The combination of falling interest rates and a rousing stock market has made these hybrid securities particularly attractive. Indeed, over the last 12 months, they outperformed all other fixed-income investments. **********''Convertibles are becoming very trendy,'' said Thomas C. Noddings, chairman of Noddings, Kalamos Asset Management, an Oakbrook, Ill., firm that manages two convertible mutual funds. **********Because of their dual nature, convertible securities - bonds or preferred stock that can be converted into a fixed number of shares of common stock - often have been touted as the ideal investment. They give investors the chance to participate in a market rally since they can be converted into the common stock of the issuing company. Investors can also benefit from a rally by holding onto or trading the convertible itself, whose price tracks with the underlying stock. Convertibles generally tend to lag behind common stocks, however. In 1985, for instance, when Standard & Poor's 500-common stock index had a total return of 31 percent, an index of 100 convertible issues maintained by Goldman, Sachs & Company returned 27 percent. **********And because convertibles are high-yielding compared with common stocks, guaranteeing investors an interest payment or dividend, they can be a refuge when the market is falling. While stock market indexes have declined about 8 percent in July, convertible securities have fallen by only half that much in value, market participants estimated. **********The total size of the convertible market is estimated at between $50 billion and $60 billion, up from $40 billion 18 months ago. A number of Wall Street firms and mutual fund organizations such as Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Alliance Capital Management, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Putnam Management offer mutual funds that invest exclusively in convertible securities. Corporate pension funds have also discovered this market sector and have invested billions of dollars. **********But the increased demand has led corporate issuers to be less generous in the terms they offer. While investors still like convertibles, they complain there are fewer and fewer bargains. The conversion premium - the price paid above and beyond the value if an issue is converted into common stock - has widened, making many convertibles more expensive than before. **********As a result of these higher premiums, some professional investors have moved temporarily to the sidelines. ''We have not been buying aggressively,'' said Gerald B. Unterman, vice president of New York's Salomon Asset Management, which invests $450 million on convertible securities for institutional accounts. ''We might see a better buying opportunity shortly.'' Added Mr. Noddings: ''Maybe a market shakeout is what's needed.'' **********Of course, investors believe there are still some issues worth buying, although they are not cheap. Several portfolio managers like the issues offered by financial companies, whose stock has been doing particularly well. By some estimates, financial companies' convertibles have been responsible for almost one-quarter of this year's new issues. Mr. Unterman, for example, owns convertible issues of insurance companies, savings and loan associations and financial service firms. Among his clients' holdings are the convertible bonds or preferred stock of Cigna, Travelers, Torchmark, First Wachovia and the Bank of New York. **********Scheetz, Smith & Company, a Pittsburgh firm that invests $140 million in convertibles for institutions and individuals, also buys convertible securities of financial companies, including insurance companies - Cigna and Orion Capital - and regional banks - Colonial Bank in Alabama, Old Kent in Michigan and Union National in Pittsburgh. **********At the same time, many convertible money managers are avoiding the ''busted'' convertible securities of oil companies, offshore drillers, hospital management companies and some airlines. ''We don't see any quick return to prosperity'' for many of these companies, Mr. Unterman added. **********And one investment professional believes that fewer bargains exist among the well-known, major corporations, including I.B.M., Pfizer and Westinghouse. The newly formed mutual funds tend to favor these companies, said Pat Peters, portfolio manager of the $900 million convertible fund at the J. P. Morgan Investment Management Company in New York. As a result, prices of the smaller issues may offer better values for investors. ''Of course they are more research-intensive and have far less liquidity,'' she added. **********Still, one trader said he liked I.B.M.'s convertible issue; the stock has dropped almost 12 percent and the convertible issue is down about 5 percent. **********Convertibles, like other corporate bonds, have a distinct disadvantage these days. Unless the issues offer investors ''call protection,'' they can be called for cash by companies that want to refinance at lower rates. In these situations, investors have lost the high income as well as the difference between the convertible's market price and its call price, which is set by the company when it issues the convertibles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/23/world/soviet-dissident-to-stay-in-west.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 247, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET DISSIDENT TO STAY IN WEST", "print_headline": "SOVIET DISSIDENT TO STAY IN WEST", "body_text": " **********Irina Ratushinskaya, the Soviet dissident poet, met today with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

They said the impact of the tax plan passed last December by the House of Representatives would be similar in most respects. **********The most immediate impact, the analyses showed, would be a sharp slowdown in the construction of rental housing and a drop in the value of existing rental properties. This situation would eventually reverse as housing supplies tightened and rents rose to levels that would offset the loss of tax benefits. **********But most analysts believe that the Senate tax plan would also help hold down interest rates, and this would partly make up for the cutback in tax benefits. First-Time Buyers Aided **********Furthermore, they say, lower interest rates would make owning a home slightly more affordable for first-time buyers. Many of them should also find that the tax restructuring has left them with more disposable income to spend on housing. **********''Rental will become more expensive, but the home market should continue to improve,'' said Stan Ross, co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Company, an accounting firm specializing in real estate. **********Real estate is bound to be hurt in almost any tax revision effort. Simply by lowering tax rates, tax benefits are diluted. Furthermore, Treasury economists have sought from the beginning of the tax revision effort to curtail real estate tax incentives. They argue that the tax structure has caused too much of the nation's resources to flow into real estate projects that are not economically sound. They cite as evidence the high vacancy rates and oversupply of office buildings and hotel rooms in many cities. **********Analysts differ on the magnitude of the likely changes, but they agree that the biggest impact would be in the rental market. According to most analysts, the loss of various tax incentives will eventually raise rents by an extra 10 percent to 30 percent over the expected increases. However, in most areas, these increases would occur over a period of years. **********The biggest impact on homeowners is expected to occur at the top end of the market, where some analysts foresee that the appreciation of property values might be 20 percent less than it would have been without tax changes. **********This category of housing may suffer because upper-income individuals would see the sharpest decline in the value of the tax benefits associated with owning a home. While the deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes would be fully retained on first and second homes, these deductions would be worth far less if the top tax rate were reduced to 27 percent, from the current 50 percent, as under the Senate plan. **********For example, a homeowning family in the top tax bracket with annual mortgage interest payments of $20,000 a year now saves $10,000 in taxes, but would save only $5,400 under the Senate's 27 percent rate. **********This family might still end up paying less taxes under the Senate plan than it does now, since its income would be taxed at lower rates. But its after-tax cost of homeownership would go up, and this reduced tax subsidy is expected to act to hold down property values. **********For homes now valued at $150,000 or more, the impact could be as much as 15 to 20 percent, estimated Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley and a consultant-manager for real estate research at the investment banking firm of Salomon Brothers Inc. **********This decline would not occur overnight, he said, but rather over a period of five to seven years. Many homeowners might not even notice it, Mr. Rosen said, as property values might still continue to rise. However, the effect of the tax plan on higher-priced homes, he said, would be similar to the impact of an increase in mortgage rates of from 1 percentage point to 3 percentage points. A Smaller Impact **********The impact would be much less on middle- and lower-priced homes because those owners would not see their tax rate drop as far as would those in the top brackets. For median-priced homes, Mr. Rosen predicts no more than a 2 percent to 5 percent damper on increases in property values. **********The House bill would have less of an impact on property values because its top tax rate would be 38 percent. But House tax writers say that the top rate in any House-Senate compromise legislation is likely to be closer to the Senate's. **********Under both bills, the impact on rental housing is expected to be much more significant than for owner-occupied homes because of the variety of investor incentives that would be curtailed. The Senate provisions are somewhat harsher than the House bill, but housing economists believe that might be offset because the Senate plan is expected to bring about lower interest rates over all than the House plan. **********Under both plans, depreciation deductions would be scaled back. The Senate bill would also repeal capital gains tax treatment and impose strict limits on interest deductions. In addition, the Senate's plan goes much further than the House's in curbing tax shelter deductions by preventing investors from using real estate tax shelter losses to offset taxes on their income from other sources. An Exception for Some **********An exception would be made for investors who actively manage rental properties. Except for the wealthiest taxpayers, landlords would be allowed to use up to $25,000 in losses from their rental properties to offset other income. This exception would be phased out for those with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000. **********House members like the idea of putting stiff restrictions on tax shelters, but some of them want more liberal transition rules to better protect existing investments. But even that would do little to alter the expected long-term impact of the Senate plan. **********As a result of the likely tax changes, Mr. Rosen predicts the Senate tax plan would force rents up by 20 percent to 30 percent. Patric H. Hendershott, a professor of real estate at Ohio State University, estimates a 10 percent to 15 percent increase. Mr. Ross of Kenneth Leventhal forecasts a 15 percent to 20 percent increase. **********William B. Brueggeman and Thomas Thibodeau, professors of real estate at Southern Methodist University, said their analysis of a hypothetical 200-unit apartment complex found rent increases ranging from 17.5 percent to 39 percent. **********Apartment dwellers would not be faced with a sudden sharp rent increase. Because of market conditions or local rent controls, landlords cannot easily increase rents sharply. **********Rather, the most immediate impact would be a decline in value of existing rental housing as buyers would be unwilling to pay as much in an environment of curtailed tax benefits. At the same time, construction of rental units would slow since investors would find them unattractive at current rent levels without the tax benefits. Jesse M. Abraham, an economist at Data Resources Inc., who does not foresee any significant decline in interest rates from the Senate plan, estimates that multifamily housing starts would drop by one-third. **********As the housing supply tightens, there would be upward pressure on rents. Theoretically, they would eventually rise enough to compensate landlords for the loss of tax benefits. **********In markets where there is an oversupply of housing, such as Houston, the impact on rents might not be felt for several years. In areas where housing is tight, such as Boston, the impact might come much sooner. **********In communities with rent control laws, like New York City, landlords would face obstacles in trying to increase rents quickly even though housing supplies are tight. **********Real estate groups have tried to rally grass-roots support for their cause by warning that the House and Senate bills would lead to increases in rents that would more than offset any tax savings tenants might realize. **********But George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, rejects such dire predictions. Lower interest rates, he said, would compensate for part of the loss of tax benefits. And although depreciation for newly acquired residential real estate would be scaled back to 27.5 years under the Senate plan, from 19 years now, rental properties would have an advantage over office buildings and other commercial real estate, which would have to be written off over 31.5 years. Depreciation for both residential and commercial buildings would be 30 years under the House bill. Opinion on Tax Shelters **********Mr. Sternlieb also discounted the impact of the proposed curbs on tax shelters. ''The sale of tax shelters is a very inefficient way of getting rental housing built because you have enormous markups,'' he said, noting that some syndicators mark up properties as much as 30 percent to 40 percent. **********Nevertheless, he and other housing analysts expressed concern that the tax incentives for low-income rental housing under the plans would not be sufficient to insure an adequate supply of affordable housing. **********Should rent levels increase, homeownership is likely to become a more attractive option for more people, particularly if mortgage rates decline. Although the after-tax cost of homeownership would rise - because the value of the tax deductions would be reduced by the lower tax rates - most people would have slightly more money in their pockets to spend on housing. The lower tax rates would also make it easier to save for a down payment. **********Furthermore, homes would become a source of extra tax deductions. While the deduction for consumer interest, such as on credit cards, would be repealed under the Senate plan, homeowners could still make tax-deductible interest payments by taking out a second mortgage or home-equity loan to finance their purchases. **********Currently, slightly fewer than two-thirds of Americans are homeowners. Mr. Hendershott of Ohio State estimates that the Senate tax bill would increase homeownership over all by about 1 percentage point."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/29/business/economic-scene-on-financial-system-reform.html": {"writer_name": "E.

Indeed, while much has been written about this, the long-term implications for the structure and functioning of markets and institutions here and abroad are not easy to fully anticipate. **********From what we have already witnessed, however, several things are clear: *********** Technology and innovation have permitted the application of sophisticated forms of mathematics and computer technology in the financial marketplace. This has helped to foster new techniques, new instruments and trading and funding strategies that create complex operational, liquidity and credit interdependencies. *********** Money and capital markets are now truly international in character, operating in enormous size, around the clock and around the world. *********** In the United States, historic distinctions between certain classes of financial institutions have largely disappeared. While distinctions between ''banks'' and ''thrift institutions'' have been blurring for some time, it is now increasingly evident that the distinction between commercial banking and investment banking is also being eroded. *********** Perhaps even more fundamental, the distinction between ''banking'' and ''commerce'' is also being challenged. That is, whether it is via the acquisition of thrift units, nonbank banks or the expansion into ''nonbank'' financial activities, commercial concerns now have a major presence in the market place for the provision of financial, if not ''banking,'' services. **********While these and other trends provide clear opportunities for greater efficiency and flexibility to both the suppliers and users of financial services, they also have worked to highlight differences in the supervisory, accounting, tax and regulatory treatment of transactions and institutions. **********These trends have also accentuated the tendency to exploit loopholes in laws and regulations and, in the extreme, to undertake activities under the purview of the least supervisory resistance. While these tendencies are not new, the events of the past several years seem to convey not merely a difference in degree but, perhaps, in kind as well. **********These developments beg for a coherent response by legislators and regulators alike. To some extent, this can be done within the framework of existing law, as for example, the continuing efforts to adapt bank supervisory standards and examination techniques to the changing enviroment. **********However, it is doubtful that patchwork changes - whether supervisory or legislative - can constitute an effective response to the changes. What is needed is a broad-based and progressive overhaul of our Federal banking and related statutes and a greater degree of supervisory harmony internationally. **********However, there are imposing barriers. For example, within the commercial banking industry -to say nothing of the broader financial services industry - it has not been possible to carve out a general consensus on what constitutes an appropriate near-term or long-term approach. **********The inability to reach such a consensus reflects, in part, the complexity of the issues, but it also stems from an apparent belief that certain interests would be better served by the current helter-skelter of events. Lacking a workable consensus, it is not surprising that the political process is also stalled. **********On the international side, the barriers are even more formidable, in that they are often accentuated by even sharper differences in accounting, tax, legislative and regulatory considerations, as well as differences in tradition and culture. **********While it is easy to understand why these barriers to change have been so difficult to overcome, those difficulties should not divert attention from the important public policy considerations associated with the operation of the banking and financial system. While some of these considerations, such as providing a measure of official protection to small investors and depositors, are relatively specific, others bearing on the stability of the system - and public confidence in it - are more vague, but ultimately more important. **********Looked at in that light, the task is to blend together diverse public and private interests into a coherent view of the future structure of the financial system. As things now stand, there is a danger that events could elbow aside certain of those public interest considerations, thus undermining that necessary blend and doing so in ways that will not easily be remedied. **********For that reason alone, but for others as well, the task of coming to grips with needed legislative reform at home and greater coordination abroad is so pressing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/15/business/from-legend-to-inside-trader.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1986-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1304, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FROM LEGEND TO INSIDE TRADER", "print_headline": "FROM LEGEND TO INSIDE TRADER", "body_text": " **********Ivan F. Boesky once compared himself in an interview to an artist who saw more in the world than the ordinary person - ''nuances, particularities, colors that are probably heightened beyond what they might have been.'' **********Indeed, he became the stuff of legend for his near addiction to mounds of details on companies and takeovers, and his uncanny ability to sniff out deals before anyone else. As a result, Mr. Boesky, who is 49 years old, made a fortune for himself and for the investors who joined his arbitrage partnerships to speculate on takeovers and other potential stock market winners. **********The announcement yesterday that Mr. Boesky had agreed to what was by far the largest insider trading settlement in history, and the likelihood that he will face criminal charges and may go to prison for his misdeeds, will only add to the bank of stories that are conjured up at the mere mention of his name. A Massive Following **********Mr. Boesky's reputation had created a huge following of Boesky-watchers on Wall Street, other investors who did little but try to learn what stocks he was buying and to pour their own cash in behind him, so magic did they find his touch. Stories circulated in the investment community of how he would pay millions to hire lawyers to research every aspect of a proposed transaction, or of how he once paid a clerk at a private airport to track corporate jets. **********Adding to the legend were the stories of his frenetic energy - the pots of black coffee he drank daily, the fact that he never seemed to stop to eat beyond occasional nibbling at fruit salads, the banks of telephones in his Fifth Avenue offices through which he worked. **********Mr. Boesky also startled the financial world earlier this year when he raised by far the largest pool of assets with which to play the arbitrage game: about $900 million. And that capital could be tripled through borrowings, he said in documents given to investors in his partnerships. A Wealthy Man **********Most of all, there was his vast wealth. Forbes magazine estimated that he was worth $200 million, and documents have confirmed the millions he made every year through his companies. Sources have said that when he liquidated his old trading vehicle earlier this year and formed a new one, Ivan F. Boesky & Company L.P., he withdrew for himself $193 million. Ironically, the sources said that he was extraordinarily conservative in his own investments, putting most of that money in Treasury bills. **********In the Getty-Texaco merger alone he is reputed to have earned $60 million. **********But he was also often described as charming and personable, even disarming. ''Here was this legend, and he was so nice, so pleasant,'' said one senior Wall Street executive who dined with Mr. Boesky on several occasions, only to find himself eating while the short, gray-haired Mr. Boesky, always tidy in a three-piece suit, picked at a salad and sipped coffee. Stressed Service to Investors **********Mr. Boesky was tireless in the last few years in telling audiences about what a service he actually performed for the market. He stressed that by buying up shares in the public market from other investors he allowed them to make a profit on a takeover while he absorbed the risk. But he never seemed entirely comfortable in public, flashing his signature broad, chilling smile. **********Mr. Boesky came a long way from his modest beginnings as the son of a Russian immigrant in Detroit, the owner of a chain of delicatessens. By the age of 13 Mr. Boesky was driving an ice cream truck around the city -without a driver's license. He passed through several colleges in Michigan without actually collecting an undergraduate degree and finally completed his studies at the Detroit College of Law in 1964. **********But his monied ways began while still in law school when he married Seema Silberstein, who happened to be the daughter of the owner of the exclusive Beverly Hills Hotel -which was recently put up for sale. First Brush With S.E.C.  Mr. Boesky headed to New York, where he landed his first position in a brokerage firm in 1966; by 1972 he was running the arbitrage department at Edwards & Hanly, a small firm. He had his first brush with the Securities and Exchange Commission while there, when he was hit with a $10,000 fine and censured for breaching a securities trading regulation. **********In 1975 he began what turned out to be the first of many independent brokerage firms devoted exclusively to the art of arbitrage. The original $700,000 in equity swelled quickly to reach $94 million in 1979 as his record attracted even more investors. **********The takeover boom that has swept through corporate America and Wall Street in this decade only fueled more explosive growth for Mr. Boesky. As of a year ago, his partnership had assets of $1.6 billion. A Mixed Record **********Mr. Boesky turned in a mixed record, earning $49 million in 1979, losing $10.5 million in 1983 and gaining $67.3 million in the 10-month period that ended Oct. 31 of last year, according to documents that he circulated to his investors. **********Mr. Boesky practiced what was known as risk arbitrage, the business of playing takeover stocks. In one form of this, the arbitrager only bets on announced takeovers. In the last several years, however, arbitragers have taken on another role. They have invested extensively in the stocks of companies not yet the subject of takeover bids. Mr. Boesky called this ''pre-arbitrage'' in documents given his investors. It has often been wondered if this were a euphemism, covering up an illicit network of insiders who swapped advance information about deals with each other for their own profit. **********Mr. Boesky's routine gave him little time to enjoy his 200-acre estate in Westchester County. The estate is said to be surrounded by beautifully manicured gardens and to have squash and tennis courts. An Early Riser **********Mr. Boesky's routine usually began at about 4:30 A.M. when he rose after some two hours or so of sleep. He was generally in New York City by 6 A.M. and finished with several meetings by the time he met his staff at 7:30 A.M. After that he would lodge himself in his large, white-carpeted office and begin the telephone calls, plugging into his legendary network of sources. **********Afternoons often found him in the Harvard Club. He never attended Harvard, but reportedly a large donation gained him club membership. He conducted business from the club's private rooms. **********The pace was a difficult one, but Mr. Boesky seemed to thrive on it. He had come to be looked upon on Wall Street as a sort of investment machine, permanently searching for the next profitable deal. **********As he once said in an interview: ''I sometimes casually say that I was given the God-given gift of being a horse that's kind of good at running around a track. I don't know any other way. I don't know how to be a milk horse and I don't know how to go to pasture. So I just keep doing what I was allowed to have the good fortune to do well and try to do it better and better and better.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/06/business/consumer-borrowing-increased.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 239, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Consumer Borrowing Increased", "print_headline": "Consumer Borrowing Increased", "body_text": " **********Americans, still borrowing heavily to finance new-car purchases, took out $6.78 billion more in consumer debt in October than they paid off, the Government reported today. **********The Federal Reserve Board said the October increase followed an even larger $7.72 billion September advance, with both months reflecting heavy borrowing to purchase new cars. **********The report said 60 percent of the growth in consumer installment debt in October came from a $4.05 billion rise in auto loans.

Arnold, editor of Electronic Materials Report, a newsletter that monitors the semiconductor materials industry. ''If they control that, they control everything.'' **********Siltec, based in Menlo Park, Calif., said the price of the proposed sale was $8.70 a share, or $32 million. Stockholders will receive only $7.95 a share; the other 75 cents a share will be put into escrow to cover possible claims against Siltec arising from groundwater pollution at its Mountain View, Calif., facility. The sale requires approval by Siltec shareholders, both companies' boards of directors and Government agencies. **********Much attention has been paid to the advance of the Japanese in making semiconductors, the chips that are used in computers, telephones, robots and all other electronic devices. Somewhat less noticed, however, has been the fact that Japanese suppliers are also gaining in the equipment and materials needed to make the chips. **********''The Japanese have continued to make inroads into the materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors,'' said Joseph Grenier, an analyst with Dataquest, a market research firm. **********Japanese companies, led by the Kyocera Corporation, already supply most of the market for ceramic packages used to house chips. Japanese companies also dominate the market for quartz blanks used to make photomasks, a key part of manufacturing. **********Wafers are flat, circular pieces of silicon, a few inches in diameter, on which circuit patterns are etched. The wafers are then cut up into dozens of fingernail-size chips. **********One reason Japanese wafer suppliers have built their market share is that more and more of the chips are being made by Japanese companies. **********''A few short years ago, 60 percent of silicon consumption was in the United States,'' said James Springgate, president of the Monsanto Electronic Materials Company. Now, he said, only 35 percent of the consumption is in this country. **********Siltec, hurt by the slump in overall semiconductor sales and the loss of business to Japan, lost $14.3 million in 1985.

Currently, the president is chosen by an electoral college. The five men were released today after being formally charged, the aides said. **********The aides said four or five other opposition party members were in police custody and the police were seeking five others for questioning.

The prosecutor's office declined to comment, and officials of the Korea Overseas Information Service said they did not know whether the reports were true. Official Held for Questioning **********Mr. Kim's aide also said that the police were holding for questioning an official of the Council for Promotion of Democracy, an opposition group of which Mr. Kim is co-chairman. The official had been meeting with aides of Mr. Kim at a coffee shop near Mr. Kim's home. Tonight several hundred police officers surrounded the home of Mr. Kim, who was placed under house arrest on Wednesday, and his telephone was cut off. **********With the reports of the arrests, the conflict between the Government and the opposition appeared to be worsening, although a Western diplomat here said he did not believe a crisis was imminent. He said that would depend on whether the Government fulfilled its threats to arrest those who had signed the petition. **********The Constitution can only be revised on the recommendation of President Chun Doo Hwan or by a majority of the National Assembly. **********The police continued searching today for the list of people who signed the petition, but Mr. Kim's aide said they had not found the list. The aide said, however, that the signers included 71 elected opposition members of the National Assembly.

The issue of constitutional revision relates to the sensitive question of Mr. Chun's political future. **********Mr. Chun has said he will step down in 1988 and allow presidential elections. But opposition leaders fear that even if Mr. Chun keeps his pledge, the indirect electoral system now mandated by the Constitution would allow him to hand-pick his successor. Both Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam, another prominent opposition political leader, could be potential presidential candidates in 1988. **********The Government has responded aggressively to the petition drive, diplomats here said, because they feel threatened by the issue. Opposition leaders say the goal of 10 million signatures will be difficult to achieve, given the Government's stern posture, but they believe a substantial number of signatures would point to evidence of dissatisfaction with Mr. Chun. **********An aide to Kim Young Sam said today that Mr. Kim, who has twice been barred by police from meeting with other opposition leaders, plans to hold an outdoor meeting of the hearing committee of the Council for Promotion of Democracy Monday morning to discuss the petition drive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/13/business/intervening-in-the-oil-market-the-market-will-cushion-price-shocks.html": {"writer_name": "John Sawhill", "pub_date": "1986-04-13", "snippet": "BOTH before and after his talks with the Saudis about oil prices, Vice President Bush roiled the oil markets by repeatedly mentioning the need for stability and the threat to national security posed by falling oil prices, implicitly suggesting tha...", "word_count": 899, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERVENING IN THE OIL MARKET;\nTHE MARKET WILL CUSHION PRICE SHOCKS", "print_headline": "INTERVENING IN THE OIL MARKET;\nTHE MARKET WILL CUSHION PRICE SHOCKS", "body_text": " **********BOTH before and after his talks with the Saudis about oil prices, Vice President Bush roiled the oil markets by repeatedly mentioning the need for stability and the threat to national security posed by falling oil prices, implicitly suggesting that the United States might establish a price floor to protect domestic production. Although at a news conference last week, President Reagan reaffirmed his intention to let the market set oil prices, Mr. Bush's remarks provided fresh ammunition for proponents of an import fee or other devices to prop up prices. **********Whether Vice President Bush speaks for the Administration on this issue or not, any talk of price stability and price floors as energy policy goals is worrisome. There is little proven need for such a policy - many of the concerns raised by falling oil prices are not well founded. And, even if we wanted to prop up oil prices, there is simply no way to accomplish that without large-scale, and inevitably inefficient, Government intervention. **********The chief concern raised by sharply falling oil prices is that they could trigger a decline in domestic production and an increase in consumption that would lead us, in a few short years, back into OPEC's clutches. To some extent, this concern is legitimate, but it ignores the changes that have occurred since the costly oil shocks of 1973 and 1979. **********The major change is the creation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which now contains almost 500 million barrels and can be drawn down at a rate of up to 2.1 million barrels a day. In fact, lower oil prices give us a chance to expand the reserve further, a move that the Administration is apparently contemplating. **********Our vulnerability to another price shock is also mitigated by the increasing diversity of world oil supplies. In 1973, there was limited production from places such as Britain, Norway and Mexico. Today, these non-OPEC countries are among the world's largest producers, and countries such as Colombia will soon begin exporting substantial quantities. Less than 18 percent of the world's oil supply today comes from the Persian Gulf. It would likely be well beyond 1990 before this figure could return to the 1973 level of 37 percent. **********Finally, we will undoubtedly benefit from the experience of the last decade. With the strategic reserve insuring against price shocks, a reduction in the oil surplus will likely lead to more gradual price increases. The industry has shown it can gear up to produce quickly if the market tightens (for instance, the domestic rig count doubled in just four years - rising from about 2,000 in 1977 to over 4,000 in 1981). And the Government price-control schemes that stifled demand and supply response and contributed to higher prices in the past are unlikely to be renewed. **********Low oil prices will cause continuing economic pain in states such as Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. While price floors would undoubtedly help the oil-producing states, it is difficult to place their economic interests ahead of the rest of the country. The benefits of lower oil prices are, after all, substantial. As the economist William D. Nordhaus pointed out recently, the oil price decline will have a stimulative impact equal to a $50 billion tax cut while at the same time reducing inflation. EVEN if ending the decline in oil prices were a rational policy goal, doing so would be an extremely difficult and complex task. First, it is always difficult to determine what the price should be. My guess is that the market will ultimately stabilize at something more than the $10-a-barrel price reached last week. In this price range, some high-cost producing sources (for example, stripper wells and projects to recover heavy oil) become uneconomic. **********In addition, substantial demand increases can be expected. Oil at $10 to $12 a barrel is cheaper than coal at its current prices for many electric utilities here and in Europe, and many American utilities and industrial users are already substituting oil for natural gas. **********Identifying the desired price is only the first hurdle. Getting there is equally hard. In this regard, it is not clear what Vice President Bush wants the Saudis to do. The Saudis would probably have to cut prodution by 2 million to 3 million barrels a day to eliminate the current surplus. But if it was too painful to operate at low production levels last summer, it will not be any easier at today's reduced prices. And even if the Saudis did cut production, other hard-pressed producers would surely jump in. **********The only way to support American prices, then, would be to impose a tax on imports. Many oil industry executives and the Reagan Administration have opposed such a tax, recognizing that it could easily lead to a complicated mass of regulation designed to protect certain consumers, such as heating-oil users or businesses facing international competition. These companies (including Amoco and Exxon) have focused on cutting costs, reducing operations in areas where they are not well positioned, generally avoiding debt and taking other steps intended to give them the flexibility to operate profitably at much lower oil prices. **********In short, not only is an artificial price floor in the oil market of questionable need but its mechanics are far from trivial. Our move toward a market-driven energy policy has worked well. This is not the time to abandon that effort."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/24/world/30-reported-slain-in-south-africa.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1986-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 464, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "30 REPORTED SLAIN IN SOUTH AFRICA", "print_headline": "30 REPORTED SLAIN IN SOUTH AFRICA", "body_text": " **********At least 30 people were reported slain in renewed tribal fighting between Zulus and Pondos south of Durban today that left hundreds of shanty homes ablaze and sent hundreds of blacks fleeing for safety. **********The battle, fought with homemade shotguns, spears, clubs and knives, appeared to be a continuation of similar clashes between Zulus and Pondos last month that left around 60 dead. **********At that time the Zulus seemed to have suffered the most casualties.

That support runs out on March 31. White House officials said on Tuesday that Mr. Reagan had decided to seek about $100 million in new money, with at least $60 million of that devoted to military support. Congress Is Reluctant **********Congressional reluctance to go along with Mr. Reagan's aid request for the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, is only one of several areas where the lawmakers seem opposed to a newly resolute foreign policy emanating from the Reagan Administration. **********Legislators from both parties said the Administration would almost certainly lose if it decided to renew a request to sell sophisticated arms to Jordan. Under a resolution adopted last year, that sale was delayed until March 1. The sale would go ahead after that date unless the Administration withdraws the proposal, or Congress moves to block it. **********At a meeting with Republican leaders on Tuesday, Mr. Reagan made an appeal for the arms sale and stressed the role played in Middle East peace efforts by King Hussein of Jordan, according to Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi. ''There was obviously some emotion in his expression,'' Mr. Cochran recalled. ''He wanted our attention on this point.'' **********But Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, told the Administration two weeks ago that any request for an arms sale to Jordan ''would go down to a pretty quick defeat,'' according to Mark Helmke, a spokesman for the Senator. Opposition on Aid to Angola **********The Administration will also face strong opposition if it decides to move forward with a plan to aid rebels who are battling the Marxist Government of Angola. Conservatives on Capitol Hill are arguing strenuously for such aid, and Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the rebels, is coming to Washington shortly to publicize his cause. **********But many lawmakers believe that aiding Mr. Savimbi would harm America's relations with other countries in the region, Mr. Helmke said, because the rebels already receive help from South Africa. **********Another troublesome foreign policy area is the Philippines, which is holding national elections next month. Senator Lugar is due to receive a report from a commission of experts on Thursday regarding the fairness of those elections, and Mr. Helmke said the report would raise ''very serious doubts'' about the conditions under which the voting would take place. **********Accordingly, Senator Lugar is undecided about whether to send an official American delegation to observe the balloting, Mr. Helmke said. The Senator would like to ''show the flag'' and support steps toward democracy in the Philippines, the aide explained, but at the same time, he does not want to be in a position of ''certifying a bad election'' by his presence. Swing of Opinion Cited **********On the subject of aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, the Administration maintains that there has been a significant swing of opinion on Capitol Hill in favor of greater support for the insurgents. The main reason, they say, has been repressive domestic actions by the Sandinista Government, which has said that such steps as suspension of some civil rights and press censorship have been necessitated by the United States-backed war against them. **********A senior House Democrat, who did not want to be identified, said that recent actions by the Sandinistas had ''strengthened the position'' of the Administration and boosted their chances for success. In particular, he said, lawmakers were upset over reports that the Government was cracking down on both the Roman Catholic Church and the press, and suppressing expressions of dissent. **********But the dominant view is that a request for military aid would still have great trouble passing the House. Representative Dave McCurdy, an Oklahoma Democrat who played a pivotal role in enacting the humanitarian aid package last year, said he would not support military aid unless the Administration altered its policy and actively pursued a negotiated settlement of the Nicaraguan struggle through the Contadora nations. The group comprising the four countries - Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela and Panama - is named for the Panamanian island where they first met to organize their peace initiative. **********In addition, lawmakers maintain that a new law that mandates a balanced budget within five years will make it more difficult for the Administration to seek increased aid to any foreign recipient, including the contras."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/03/world/turks-kill-4-iranians.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turks Kill 4 Iranians", "print_headline": "Turks Kill 4 Iranians", "body_text": " **********Turkish border patrol troops shot four Iranians to death as suspected smugglers as they were trying to cross into Turkey illegally, the independent news agency Hurriyet Haber Ajansi reported today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/19/world/the-white-house-crisis-the-fifth-amendment-vs-the-chain-of-command.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Taylor", "pub_date": "1986-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1300, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE FIFTH AMENDMENT VS. THE CHAIN OF COMMAND", "print_headline": "THE WHITE HOUSE CRISIS; THE FIFTH AMENDMENT VS. THE CHAIN OF COMMAND", "body_text": " **********The decision by Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent has spurred debate on whether President Reagan can legally force them to abandon those rights - or should at least try to persuade them to do so. **********The first question is primarily one of law: Does the President, as Commander-in-Chief, have authority to order active-duty officers to give possibly incriminating testimony about their official actions on matters of great public importance, on pain of demotion, dismissal or even court-martial if they refuse? **********The second question goes to the ambiguous place of the privilege against self-incrimination in the nation's hierarchy of values. Some see it as a bedrock principle of liberty, invocation of which should never be penalized or even criticized; others see it as a limited safeguard against official abuse, to be treated grudgingly because it often shields criminals and hides the truth. **********Mr. Reagan has suggested that he has no inclination, even if he has the authority, to pressure Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North to testify without immunity. Instead, he urged Congress on Tuesday promptly to grant them limited ''use immunity'' so that they could testify without fear that their disclosures could be used to convict them of crime. Overlapping Jurisdictions **********While Federal criminal courts would presumably have overlapping jurisdiction with military courts over any crimes committed by Admiral Poindexter or Colonel North while they were members of the National Security Council staff, any action against them for violating a hypothetical command by their Commander-in-Chief to testify would presumably go to a military court. **********Decisions of military courts, however, are ultimately reviewable by the Supreme Court. **********Some legal experts, in particular Prof. Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School, said this week that it was possible, but not certain, that the President could legally order Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North to testify without immunity. Others, including the American Civil Liberties Union, argued strenuously that such an order would be illegal. **********There was general agreement with the White House view that such a move would raise complex legal issues under the Constitution and under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and might jeopardize prospects for any criminal prosecution of the two men. **********The experts also agreed, on the other hand, that the President legally could - although not necessarily that he should - transfer any military or civilian employee from a sensitive position for invoking the Fifth Amendment, or remove a Cabinet officer or other high-ranking political appointee from office for doing so. Stand Called Uncharacteristic **********Professor Tribe said in an interview that while it was unclear whether the President could order an officer to waive his rights, it was uncharacteristic of the Reagan Administration to be so deferential to the Fifth Amendment rights of two men who are suspects in a criminal investigation. **********He contrasted this deference with Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d's repeated attacks on the Supreme Court's 1966 ruling in Miranda v. Arizona that arrested criminal suspects must be warned of their right to remain silent, and with the Administration's success in persuading the Supreme Court to rule in a case earlier this year that the military may greatly restrict the constitutional rights of its personnel. **********The Supreme Court has held in a number of earlier cases involving dismissal of police officers and other rank-and-file government employees that ''government cannot penalize assertion of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination by imposing sanctions to compel testimony which has not been immunized,'' as the Court put it in 1977. **********One of these cases involved police officers under investigation who were told that if they refused to answer potentially incriminating questions they would be removed from office, and that any answers they did give could be used to prosecute them. The Court ruled in 1967 that their testimony was involuntary and could not be used to convict them of crime. Another Way to Grant Immunity **********Under the logic of the 1967 decision, if Mr. Reagan ordered the two officers to testify, and they complied, a court might later bar use of the testimony against them. **********Such a ruling would retroactively give the order to testify the same effect as a grant of ''use immunity.'' The Government would be required in any criminal prosecution of either man to bear the difficult burden of proving that none of the evidence was derived directly or indirectly from the compelled testimony. **********Such an order would also be subject to the more direct criticism that ''it would be illegal,'' as Morton H. Halperin, director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union, and Eugene R. Fidell, a Washington lawyer expert in military law, both said today. **********They said such an order would violate not only the Supreme Court rulings against dismissing public employees who invoke the Fifth Amendment, but also perhaps the Uniform Code of Military Justice, an enactment of Congress. **********One section of the Uniform Code provides that no statement obtained from any person ''through the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement may be received in evidence against him in a trial by court-martial.'' Another provides that officers may be dismissed only by a court-martial, ''and in time of war, by order of the President.'' Mr. Fidell said this suggested that President may not dismiss an officer in peacetime. Officers Sacrifice Rights **********Mr. Tribe, on the other hand, said a reasonable argument could be made that the Supreme Court would not apply either its prior Fifth Amendment rulings or the Uniform Code to strike down a Presidential order requiring Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North to testify. **********He stressed that the current situation might be distinguished from the Court's precedents by the fact that Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North were high-ranking officials entrusted with matters of grave consequence to the national security; by the Supreme Court's broad deference to the power of the military (including the President as Commander-in-Chief) to curb the constitutional rights of its personnel, and by the Court's marginal narrowing in recent years of the protections of the Fifth Amendment. **********In a dissenting opinion in 1977, Justice John Paul Stevens suggested that officials at ''the policymaking levels of Government,'' unlike ordinary civil servants, should be subject to dismissal for invoking the Fifth Amendment because of the Government's interest in maintaining the appearance of integrity in high office. **********Mr. Tribe said it was fairly clear that a majority of the Court would accept this logic in the case of Cabinet officers, for example. The same reasoning might also be extended to high-ranking military officers, he said, especially in light of ''a series of Supreme Court decisions virtually stripping military officers of many of their rights, particularly at the urging of this Administration.'' **********He cited the Court's ruling earlier this year that the Air Force could bar an Orthodox Jewish officer from wearing a yarmulke on duty in a military hospital. The Court said the need to uphold the military's uniform dress code outweighed the officer's right to practice his religion. **********In the current situation, Mr. Tribe suggested, somewhat weightier Government interests than protecting the military dress code are at stake. **********Lawyers who object to the notion that the President should press the two officers to waive their constitutional rights respond that there is a ready alternative: If, after careful investigation, their testimony seems indispensable to getting the facts, they can be granted ''use immunity,'' compelled to testify on that basis, and still, perhaps, be prosecuted in the event that evidence independent of their testimony establishes that they have committed crimes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/20/business/finance-officers-wide-role.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1986-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2043, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE OFFICERS' WIDE ROLE", "print_headline": "FINANCE OFFICERS' WIDE ROLE", "body_text": " **********When Fred Zuckerman, treasurer of the Chrysler Corporation, decided to spread Chrysler's name in the financial world, he turned to Japan. Chrysler cars are not sold in Japan, but as of last month its stock has been. With its shares now listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the name of Chrysler is shouted by traders in Tokyo as loudly as it is on Wall Street. **********That means Mr. Zuckerman must stay on top of developments in Tokyo - just as other Chrysler executives do on the manufacturing side. Some day Chrysler may very well issue new equity into the Tokyo market. And the fact that a Detroit company has traveled to the financial markets of one of its arch automobile rivals, shows just how global the world of finance has become. **********Technology is shrinking the world of finance so that today it is often as easy for an American company to raise capital in London as it is in New York. And, for executives like Mr. Zuckerman, who masterminds Chrysler's financial strategy, the task of being a chief financial officer means he is called on to make more complex decisions than ever before. **********New Financing Options **********Whether it is yen-denominated Eurobonds or complex swaps involving eight different currencies, chief financial officers are finding they must pick their way through a plethora of new financing options in more and different markets. **********At one time - five years ago or so - American corporations seeking to raise money primarily sold their bonds or stocks in the domestic market. **********But those days are over. ''What has happened in the past five years is a true internationalization of the credit markets,'' said Mr. Zuckerman. ''Before that, you saw little borrowing away from a company's home country.'' **********The first break came in the late 1970's with Eurobonds, which are dollar-denominated bonds sold overseas. The amount of Eurobonds issued by American corporations has surged - from $7 billion issued in 1983, according to Investment Dealers Digest, to about $35.1 billion issued in 1986 so far. **********Since the first Eurobond, there have been a myriad of variations on that basic theme, primarily complicated swaps that appeared in 1982. With a swap, two parties exchange each other's debts. This means a corporation can issue, say, a Swiss franc-denominated bond and make dollar payments in return or can swap out of floating-rate debt into a fixed rate. **********In the past two years, overseas markets have expanded yet again with the development of Euro-equities and Euro-commercial paper. Often corporations can raise money in several markets, typically New York, Tokyo and London, at the same time. U.S. Equities Abroad Have Sharply Increased In 1986, so far, American corporations have issued about $1 billion in equities overseas, compared with $28 million as recently as 1984, according to the First Boston Corporation. **********Much of this is related to the deregulation of overseas financial markets, which have become more open to foreigners. It has also been prompted by the expansion of American investment banks overseas, which have increased the awareness and knowledge of offshore financing alternatives. Given this, chief financial officers say that their world has become more exciting and more sophisticated, yet fraught with more opportunity for error. **********''Life is a lot more interesting because the changes and opportunities are so new,'' said Jules Zimmerman, chief financial officer of Avon Products Inc. ''Three years from now, the securities being issued today overseas will look as simple as the 30-year bond of yesterday.'' **********Added Howard Clark, chief financial officer of the American Express Company: ''C.F.O.'s have to be broader and more knowledgeable than 15 years ago. They have to be more on top of available markets because every day it seems like there is a new financing technique.'' **********American Express, for instance, last March did a Euro-yen swap in which 20 billion yen were raised and then swapped into $109 million. The dollars were then swapped into debt securities of eight different currencies, some of which were at fixed and some at floating rates. **********Some corporations, such as the Data General Corporation, are increasingly turning to foreign banks for money-raising. Others, such as American Express, are listing their corporations on overseas stock exchanges, as much to get their name known overseas to stimulate interest in their business as to gain a broader market for their shares. American Express, in fact, trades on 12 foreign exchanges. And still others, such as Avon, are either stationing finance personnel overseas or sending corporate executives to call on European and Asian investors. Changes in Relationship With Investment Banker Perhaps most critical has been a change in the relationship between a chief financial officer and his investment banker. Once an investment banker was a trusted adviser to a corporate financial officer. Now those traditional ties have been broken as chief financial officers are more inclined to shop around for financial advice. **********Every day investment bankers knock on the doors of chief financial officers, peddling each new wrinkle in the latest overseas financing scheme. From adviser and client, the relationship between the chief financial offericer and his investment banker has changed more to one of salesman and customer. And this can create problems for the chief financial officer. **********''At one time, advisers were advisers,'' said Robert Glauber, professor of finance at the Harvard business school. ''There was a bond of trust. Now that the range of alternative financing vehicles has exploded, investment bankers want to sell their products. **********''And, sometimes, like in currency swaps, the investment bank is on the other side of the market, bidding against the corporation,'' Mr. Glauber said. ''The danger is when a chief financial officer thinks his banker is advising him, when the banker is really trying to sell him something. In that environment, the chief financial officer has a good chance of making a mistake. This is a terrible problem, and it can leave the chief financial officer in smaller companies, with small treasury departments, at a tremendous disadvantage.'' **********E. John Browne, chief financial officer of the Standard Oil Company, based in Cleveland, said chief financial officers ''have to be as good as investment bankers'' now. **********''With the number and nature of the transactions that have to be entered into with speed, it creates a need for a so-called in-house banker, a sort of investment bank on the premises, in order to deal on a professional level,'' said Mr. Browne, who was formerly chief financial officer for British Petroleum. ''You have to know what the market is doing and what is available, and that often comes from trading for your own account. My observation is that there are some very strange transactions that some companies are getting into that is more on the nature of buying the shiniest motor car in the store. A very small company should err on the side of caution when it does these things.'' **********Investment bankers, however, say that it is the chief financial officer who ultimately calls the shots. **********''C.F.O.'s are getting buried in proposals,'' said Robert G. Scott, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''But, by and large, they can encourage or discourage the Street. Chief financial officers have got to understand the pure arithmetic of some very different and very complicated deals. And that increases geometrically as the transactions become more multifaceted.'' **********Corporations go overseas to raise money for one simple reason - because it is cheaper. They say they can lower their borrowing costs by a quarter to a half and sometimes even a full percentage point overseas. And, some well-known American corporations say they can borrow at particularly advantageous rates overseas where many investors often look more to a company's name and less to its credit rating. **********''We get a break simply because of a different approach by investors,'' said Hans Storr, chief financial officer of Philip Morris Companies. ''They look for a name and the continuity of a company more than the kind of credit analysis done by Moody's or Standard & Poor's.'' **********Mr. Storr says that Philip Morris also goes overseas because of the size of its borrowing. Within one week, for instance, his company borrowed $1.1 billion, and by selling some of these securities overseas, it was able to get more buyers and a better price. The Chance to Cash In On Better Prices Abroad **********''The opportunities for C.F.O.'s and corporations to take advantage of better pricing overseas are in place,'' Mr. Storr said. ''It also means the chief financial officer of corpoations has to be as familiar with international markets as domestic ones. He must understand the role currencies play in the market environment and the investors' mentalities.'' **********Yet Mr. Zimmerman of Avon said it was not too difficult for chief financial offficers to come up to speed on international financial trends, particularly if they already do business overseas. ''Once you understand the basics conceptually,'' he said, ''then you can just add on the new elements. The education is basically a one-time event.'' **********For instance, in 1985 Avon issued a Euro-yen bond, which is a Eurobond denominated in yen, one of the first of its type. In this deal, Avon saved about a half of a percentage point, and raised 26 billion yen, which was worth about $100 million. The deal also featured a currency swap so that Avon would ultimately pay dollars instead of yen and an interest rate swap so that Avon makes floating-rate payments. **********Mr. Zimmerman said that he and his staff go overseas at least twice a year to meet with investors and that Avon has recently transferred an assistant treasurer to London. Lesser-Knowns Getting Established Overseas Even non-household names are able to get their credentials established overseas. Back in 1980 Stanley P. Skinner, chief financial offficer of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in San Francisco, established banking relations with five different European banks. Since then his company has issued eight separate offerings overseas raising $550 million, including a Eurobond denominated in yen and one in Swiss francs. Mr. Skinner says it is his experience that European investors are just as credit-sensitive as American buyers and that every year he and other officers of Pacific Gas call on European financial institutions. **********''For a large corporation, like P.G.&E., which has continual needs for vast amounts of capital, we have to take advantage of every market there is,'' he said. He noted, however, that 90 percent or more of the utility's financing takes place in the domestic market and that time zones represent the main difficulty of working overseas. **********''The biggest challenge is to work and think in different time zones,'' he said. ''When we did our yen offering, I worked in four time zones in a matter of minutes. And I do a lot of talking to London on Sunday nights. I carry a lot of telephone numbers around all the time.'' **********Other companies may not have sold bonds or issued stock overseas, but they have raised money through overseas banks, including those that had often shunned foreigners. Data General, for instance, has become the first non-Japanese company to borrow money on a long-term basis from the Japanese Development Bank. **********''As a matter of course, we are beginning to shop where we live,'' said Kenneth V. Jaeggi, Data General's chief financial officer. ''And we'll patronize foreign banks as long as they are competitive.'' **********Indeed, for many American corporations, the bottom line on fund raising is simply that - the bottom line. And they will go wherever the cheapest money can be found. **********''One has to stay competitive globally by not paying higher financing costs when appropriate for the risk situation,'' said Paul L. Smith, director of finance for the Eastman Kodak Company. ''The people we are competing with have all these world markets available to them, and it would put us at a cost disadvantage if we didn't avail ourselves of these opportunities.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/01/world/america-s-ire-leaves-the-french-in-a-pique.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Miller", "pub_date": "1986-05-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 664, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICA'S IRE LEAVES THE FRENCH IN A PIQUE", "print_headline": "AMERICA'S IRE LEAVES THE FRENCH IN A PIQUE", "body_text": " **********Johnny Carson threw a pie at an actor portraying a Frenchman a few days ago. **********It was part of a spoof on American anger at France for refusing to let American planes fly over French territory on their bombing raid against Libya this month. **********On Sunday night the pie-throwing scene was included among the major news items on one of France's three state-run stations.

But most see the vacation moves as politically inspired, a campaign likely to hurt the French economy. **********''It's chic to stay in America because of fear of terrorism,'' said Jean Gabriel, correspondent in New York of the pro-Socialist daily Le Matin. **********The spate of American cancellations to the 39th Cannes Film Festival has touched off particular fury. **********Although his press agent stressed that Sylvester Stallone, who plays Rambo, had declined his invitation because of scheduling conflicts, not fear of terrorism, French commentators mocked his move as sheer cowardice. **********''He's just like your foreign policy: celluloid tough,'' a former Defense Ministry official said. **********Mr. Gabriel blamed America's ''ill humor'' toward France for the bad reviews given one of the country's most successful recent films, ''Three Men and a Cradle,'' which opened in New York last week. ''Given the sheeplike spirit of Americans,'' he said, ''such reviews guarantee the film's failure.'' **********''Could the Americans have an inferiority complex toward us,'' the weekly magazine Le Point said. ''Could they be jealous of our culture, our sophistication, our taste, our subtlety.'' **********The French furor over what Le Point has labeled ''Francophobia'' does not reflect public opposition to the American attacks on Libya. Recent polls indicate that unlike the rest of Europe, where opposition to the American raid was dominant, 70 percent of the French public supported the attack. **********But roughly the same proportion supported Paris's decision not to cooperate with the Americans, an attitude that mirrors France's determination to conduct an independent foreign policy, uninfluenced by American whims. **********Some commentators have argued that France's anger partly reflects national humiliation at having been publicly thanked by Libya for shunning cooperation with the Americans and accused of being an unreliable ally by the Reagan Administration. **********The criticism has stung because American officials have reminded the French of a period they would rather forget - capitulation at the beginning of World War II and the Vichy Government's collaboration with Germany. **********The American special envoy Vernon A. Walters, who met before the raid with President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, derided France on television for ''ingratitude,'' recalling the food packages that America sent to a hungry France after the war. **********Since World War II, France has prided itself on its independent, tough-minded foreign and military policies: its decision to build its own nuclear force, its determination to protect what are seen as vital interests in its former and current colonies, its willingness to commit armed forces, if need be, toward this end. **********To combat America's perception of France as a weak ally, senior French officials have been telling reporters that France declined to allow flights over the country because it had not been involved in the planning of the raid, that it had been presented with a fait accompli. Moreover, officials said they doubted that the raid would be successful and had favored tougher joint military action against Libya."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/business/data-bank-july-13-1986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 796, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Data Bank: July 13, 1986", "print_headline": "Data Bank: July 13, 1986", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/21/world/around-the-world-bad-weather-prevents-new-raids-in-bolivia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bad Weather Prevents New Raids in Bolivia", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Bad Weather Prevents New Raids in Bolivia", "body_text": " **********Dense clouds and light rain swept over the tropical Beni region of Bolivia today, preventing further helicopter raids by a Bolivian police unit and American support troops against cocaine-processing centers. **********The strike force used the day to review intelligence reports after three straight failures to find drug centers. **********A police source said 200 additional members of the police unit known as the Leopards were to have been flown to Trinidad, 260 miles northeast of La Paz, to augment 72 members of the Leopards already taking part in the operation, but the bad weather forced a delay in that movement and it was put off until Monday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/15/world/philippine-bishops-assail-vote-fraud-and-urge-protest.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1986-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1433, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PHILIPPINE BISHOPS ASSAIL VOTE FRAUD AND URGE PROTEST", "print_headline": "PHILIPPINE BISHOPS ASSAIL VOTE FRAUD AND URGE PROTEST", "body_text": " **********The Roman Catholic bishops of the Philippines today described the presidential election a week ago as ''unparalleled'' in its fraud and endorsed nonviolent resistance to the expected outcome. **********The National Assembly, which is controlled by supporters of President Ferdinand E. Marcos, moved today to the verge of proclaiming him the winner, giving him a lead of 54 percent to 46 percent for Corazon C. Aquino, with 97 percent of the votes counted. **********The Assembly was due to resume counting Saturday, but it was not clear how soon it would make its expected proclamation of a Marcos victory. **********Those who cite fraud, including American observers who monitored the election, point to a host of abuses, including widespread violence, stealing of ballot boxes by soldiers and incidents of Government computer workers walking off the job, saying their tallies were being tampered with. **********In an interview tonight on American television, Mr. Marcos responded angrily to the bishops' statement, blaming ''priests and nuns'' for the violence, fraud and intimidation of which his followers have been accused. ''So now it turns out that if there was any fraud, it was committed by them,'' he said. **********''They used priests and nuns not only to help the opposition but to destroy the electoral process,'' he said in the CBS News interview. **********''We have pictures showing how priests and nuns were intimidating and coercing people,'' Mr. Marcos added. To Be Read in Churches **********The bishops' conference is presided over by Ricardo Cardinal Vidal and includes Jaime Cardinal Sin, the powerful Archbishop of Manila. He has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Marcos and a backer of Mrs. Aquino. **********The bishops' statement, which is to be read in churches Sunday, said, ''In our considered judgment, the polls were unparalleled in the fraudulence of their conduct.'' **********''A government that assumes or retains power through fraudulent means has no moral basis,'' it said.''Such an access to power is tantamount to a forcible seizure and cannot command the allegiance of the citizenry.'' **********It did not name names, but one bishop said, ''Filipinos know who we are talking about.'' 'Nonviolent Struggle' Urged **********The statement issued by the 103-member Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines said, ''The way indicated to us now is the way of nonviolent struggle for justice.'' **********At a news conference at which the statement was presented, one of the bishops, Teodoro Bacani, said he saw Martin Luther King Jr. and Mohandas K. Gandhi as models for the type of action being endorsed. **********The statement amounted to backing for the protest tactics planned by Mrs. Aquino and her supporters. **********In an interview today, her vice presidential running mate, Salvador H. Laurel, said Mrs. Aquino planned to announce a five-part program of civil disobedience at a rally scheduled for Sunday. ''Just for a start, to see how it works,'' Mr. Laurel said. Church Has Wide Influence **********The bishops' statement was part of an increasingly open split between the President and the church, which has wide influence in this country, 85 percent of whose people are Roman Catholics. **********The condemnation took a personal turn when one bishop, asked if a leader who had seized power in a fraudulent election would be entitled to receive communion, replied, ''Obviously not.'' **********In his interview, Mr. Marcos accused the bishops of electoral partisanship and of Communism, saying some churchmen had directed members of the New People's Army, a Communist guerrilla group, in disruption of the voting. **********''We have the evidence, and we would like to present it in court after this is all over,'' he said. **********Mr. Marcos said he had ''no doubt at all'' that he had won the election. Diverges From Earlier Counts **********When the National Assembly adjourned tonight, its count, which did not jibe with any of a half-dozen earlier tabulations, gave the President a lead of 1.4 million votes with 1.6 million votes remaining to be counted. **********After last Friday's voting, early returns were first tabulated by unofficial ''quick counts.'' Ballot boxes containing summary tallies from the election districts went to the Assembly for the official and legally binding count. **********The Assembly spent a few days wrangling over procedures and began counting Thursday. By law, the legislature certifies the count, and the certification can be challenged in a special presidential commission, which is also dominated by Marcos supporters. **********Mr. Marcos's running mate, Arturo M. Tolentino, was also leading Mr. Laurel in the vice presidential race, which is tallied separately. Wouldn't Serve With Marcos **********Mr. Laurel said in the interview that even if the count made him the winner, he would not serve in a government with Mr. Marcos, who he said could be elected only by a fraudulent count. **********He said he expected opposition legislators, who make up one-third of the Assembly, to walk out in protest sometime before the new president is proclaimed. **********Mr. Laurel said he was not certain which five of about 20 proposed forms of civil disobedience Mrs. Aquino had decided to call for. He said they might include such actions as nonpayment of taxes, work slowdowns and strikes. **********A special envoy from President Reagan, Philip C. Habib, is expected to arrive in Manila on Saturday and to meet with Mr. Marcos and Mrs. Aquino as well as representatives of the church. Bishops Urge People's Judgment **********The bishops' statement today said individual citizens and communities, under the guidance of local churches, would have to make their own judgments about the election. The bishops said they would endorse any nonviolent protests the people decided on. **********The bishops said that half of their number had attended the conference, but that the statement reflected the feelings of most members. **********The most controversial part of the statement, they said, was an introduction that suggested that despite the election's fraudulence, it had demonstrated a choice by the people of Mrs. Aquino. **********The section said: ''The people have spoken. Or have tried to. Despite the obstacles thrown in the way of their speaking freely, we, the bishops, believe that on the basis of our assessment as pastors of the recently concluded polls, what they attempted to say is clear enough.'' **********The statement condemned ''systematic disenfranchisement of voters,'' and well as ''widespread and massive vote buying,'' ''tampering with election returns,'' and ''intimidation, harassment, terrorism and murder.'' **********Members of the Marcos party called the statement rash and divisive. Marcos Backer Is 'Scared' **********''I am scared,'' Assemblyman Rafael Recto said. ''If you read between the lines, they are asking for violence.'' **********Mr. Marcos in his television interview warned of retaliation. **********''Well, there are certain legitimate actions we can take,'' he said. ''Anybody that violates the law can be charged in court. If for instance they block movement of goods or they stop transport, things like that, there are powers of the state that can be utilized.'' **********At another point he said: ''Civil war? We can handle anything they throw at us. But we are adopting a policy of maximum tolerance. We are trying to avoid a confrontation.'' **********Mr. Marcos also spoke of a ''smear campaign'' by the American press and some American ''bureaucrats,'' saying, ''These things about my medals, my guerrilla organization, unexplained wealth, and this hidden wealth in the United States, all of these are false.'' **********Asked near the end of the interview about Haiti's former President, Jean-Claude Duvalier, who was forced to flee his country, Mr. Marcos laughed and said: ''Don't compare me with Duvalier.

The criticisms are misplaced. The Department's sober examination of the Rehabilitation Act reveals a commendable dedication to the rule of law and the belief that Congress, not bureaucrats, should be the foremost architect of national public policy. **********Section 504 of the act denounces discrimination against ''otherwise qualified handicapped'' persons in programs or activities operated or funded by the Federal Government. A year after its enactment, Section 504 was amended to broaden the definition of handicap. Congress explicitly chose to protect from discrimination ''any person who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment.'' **********In 1977, under President Jimmy Carter, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued regulations that confined the concept of handicap to physical or mental diseases and disorders, and excluded age, criminality, homosexuality or cultural or economic disadvantage. Moreover, the regulations explained, a physical or mental affliction is a protected handicap only if it ''substantially limits'' a major life activity, such as self-care, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking or working. **********Neither the genesis of Section 504 nor its early administrative interpretation indicated an intent by Congress to consider whether persons who are actually capable - or simply believed to be capable - of transmitting contagious diseases should be protected against discrimination. Relying on the plain language and legislative history of Section 504, the Department of Justice reached the following irreproachable legal conclusions: *********** That victims of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, are handicapped persons protected by the Rehabilitation Act because they suffer from physiological disorders that substantially limit major life activities. *********** That victims of ARC, or AIDS-related complex, are likewise legally protected persons if the consequences of the impairment limit a major life activity. *********** That persons who test positive for AIDS antibodies or others (including AIDS victims) are unprotected under section 504 from discriminatory treatment based on a genuine belief that they may communicate AIDS to others. **********As the Department explained the latter conclusion, having a perceived capability of transmitting AIDS because of the presence in the bloodstream of AIDS antibodies or otherwise is not a protected handicap. Its reasoning was that such a believed capacity does not substantially limit an individual in performing major life activities. ACCORDINGLY, the Department declared, even if persons with AIDS antibodies suffer discrimination because of an erroneous belief that they will transmit the disease to others, Section 504 provides no remedy. That type of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, it noted, is akin to discrimination against persons who are left-handed or red-haired; it may be irrational, but Congress has not yet made it illegal. **********Strident critics are complaining that the opinion will foster discrimination against homosexuals or others perceived to be potential carriers of AIDS. These complaints are misdirected for several reasons. **********First, as the Justice Department stressed, state or local laws - or even other Federal laws - might proscribe discrimination against perceived AIDS carriers, even if Section 504 did not. Moreover, only Congress is empowered to amend Section 504 to include protection for people believed capable of transmitting AIDS - such policy decisions are constitutionally denied to the executive branch, under the separation of law-making and law-executing powers. **********The gay community and other political minorities, as the foremost beneficiaries of the rule of law, should applaud, not condemn, the Department's opinion. By refusing to usurp policy making power from Congress, the Justice Department acted in the highest tradition of executive restraint. **********Some critics of the opinion seem to be arguing that action by Congress to address statutory gaps or oversights is too slow, that Congress cannot anticipate problems such as AIDS, and that enlightened and efficient government thus requires an application of statutes beyond that intended by Congress. **********Indeed, Congress does act slowly, often without foresight, and in ways detrimental to efficient government. But our entire consitutional scheme of checks and balances is intended to curb swift government action and to subordinate efficiency concerns to safeguard liberty and freedom. Waiting for Congress to address the AIDS question may tax the patience of many. But the department's interpretation of Section 504, unlike an executive ukase, has the redeeming virtue of legality."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/21/business/advertising-billboard-announces-control-of-back-stage.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Billboard Announces Control of Back Stage", "print_headline": "Advertising; Billboard Announces Control of Back Stage", "body_text": " **********Billboard Publications, which already has seven titles, yesterday announced both the acquisition of a majority position in Back Stage and its plans to begin a new mass-circulation, rock-oriented quarterly called Inside Tracks on Dec. 1. **********Back Stage is a weekly tabloid trade newspaper that covers the commercial film, video production and theatrical services fields and has a circulation of more than 30,000. **********It carries more than 4,000 pages of advertisig annually. **********Ira Eaker, the publisher, will continue in the job and will continue to have an equity position in the paper.

Its records are in the United Nations archives. **********The commission was disbanded with no clear rules governing access to the files. In 1949, after a debate among United Nations members, the United Nations, in consultation with the former chairman and former legal counsel of the commission, declared the files closed, except for ''United Nations purposes.'' Limited access, with confidentiality required, has been permitted when United Nations members have made specific requests. Limits Termed a Shield **********The letter, signed by Mr. Netanyahu on behalf of his Government, said Israel believes ''that these self-imposed restrictions are in this case inappropriate and unacceptable.'' The letter added: ''Many of the accused war criminals are still alive and limited access to the U.N. archives shields them from prosecution.'' **********Mr. Netanyahu called it ''inconceivable that the most comprehensive concentration of information of suspected and accused Nazi war criminals will continue to be inaccessible to the general public.'' **********''Until this matter is resolved and as an interim step,'' the letter said, Israel is compiling a list of ''Nazi war criminals charged with crimes against the Jewish people'' in the hope of finding files on them in the archives. It plans to submit the list to the United Nations. **********The extent of the files only became widely known after it was disclosed that a file charging former Secretary General Kurt Waldheim with war crimes was in the archives. Mr. Waldheim is one of 24,500 individuals who were given an A classification, the commission's most serious, indicating that the subject should be tried. Request Being Considered **********Mr. Perez de Cuellar told Mr. Netanyahu that he would study his request and consult his advisers, according to a United Nations official. But another United Nations official did not rule out a change in the rules if the nations who were on the commission agreed. **********It is highly unlikely that all the nations that took part in the commission would agree to open the files to the public.

John McKnight, an Australian Anglican priest who befriended the technician, Mordechai Vanunu, said that Mr. Vananu was back in Israel, after having disappeared in London on Sept. 30, and that he had heard reports that the nuclear technician was taken before an Israeli judge on Monday and remanded in custody for 15 days. This was apparently done in a secret proceeding before he is formally tried for treason. **********''We have solid information that he is here in Israel,'' Mr. McKnight said, adding that he could not reveal the specifics of that information without endangering a source. ''I do not believe he would have left England on his own free will.'' **********Newsweek magazine reported last week that Mr. Vanunu, 31 years old, who worked for 10 years as a technician at Israel's nuclear reactor in Dimona, was abducted by agents of the Mossad secret service soon after he provided data and photographs to The Sunday Times on the workings of Israel's nuclear plant. Mr. Vanunu said in the article that Israel had stockpiled 100 atomic bombs. Reportedly Lured by Woman **********According to Newsweek, Mossad agents arranged for a female friend of Mr. Vanunu to lure him from London on a trip through Europe. While in the Mediterranean, he was persuaded to board a yacht and - once in international waters - was arrested by the Mossad crew and brought back to Israel to face trial on charges of espionage and treason. **********Israeli officials have had no official comment on the report. But if it turns out to be true that Mr. Vanunu sold the secrets of Israel's nuclear bomb factory, it would constitute one of the biggest security lapses in the history of Israel. And depending on where and how Mr. Vanunu was abducted - if that is how he was brought back to Israel - it could have implications for the diplomatic relations between Israel and one or another European nation. **********Mr. McKnight said at the news conference in Arab East Jerusalem that he came to Israel last week to try to find out what had happened to his missing friend. **********Mr. McKnight said he first met Mr. Vanunu when the technician wandered into his parish in Sydney last April or May. Mr. Vanunu, who had reportedly been laid off from his job at the Dimona nuclear plant in the Negev, was visiting Australia on a long vacation, Mr. McKnight said. **********Mr. Vanunu, according to Mr. McKnight, began coming regularly to his parish's coffee shop, and over a period of weeks the two became close friends. The Australian said that in June Mr. Vanunu decided to convert to Christianity. **********In the course of their many conversations, Mr. McKnight said, Mr. Vanunu explained that he had worked in a top-secret nuclear installation in Israel and that he had brought out unprocessed film and other data detailing exactly how it functioned. The priest said Mr. Vanunu had become disillusioned with Israel's nuclear activities. Sale to Newspaper Suggested **********Last summer, Mr. Vanunu met a man who was working around the parish in odd jobs. The man, Oskar Guerrero, came to hear about Mr. Vanunu's pictures and data on the plant and suggested the two of them could make a substantial sum of money by selling them to a newspaper, Mr. McKnight said. **********Mr. Vanunu agreed, the priest said, and Mr. Guerrero used some old contacts to make a deal with The Sunday Times. The British newspaper eventually flew Mr. Vanunu to London to question him, obtain his film and check the veracity of his story. **********Convinced it was authentic, The Sunday Times published almost three pages on the subject on Oct. 5. The article contained pictures that were supposedly taken by Mr. Vanunu in the control room of the underground bomb factory in Dimona, as well as a detailed cross-section drawing of the entire nuclear complex."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/08/business/cash-shortage-at-people-express.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 419, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cash Shortage at People Express", "print_headline": "Cash Shortage at People Express", "body_text": " **********People Express Inc. said yesterday that it was facing severe cash shortages and warned that if holders of its debt do not agree soon to proposed cuts in interest rates, its merger agreement with the Texas Air Corporation could be ended. **********It said this would force it to seek protection under Federal bankruptcy laws. **********The carrier also said that because of its deteriorating cash position, it had asked the Transportation Department to approve its proposed merger with Texas Air by Tuesday. **********People Express, which is based in Newark and is the one of the largest carriers in the New York area, said that $13.4 million in interest payments are due Oct. 15 and that it might not be able to make the payments. **********People Express said in its filing with the Transportation Department that Texas Air was not prepared to provide more cash to meet People's debt payments unless the merger was approved. **********David Sylvester, an airlines analyst for Montgomery Securities, said that unless the department approved the acquisition and debt holders accepted the cuts, People Express would run out of cash and stop operating by the end of this month.

But it is not the only problem to which the country's new leaders are giving immediate attention, records of the meetings indicate. **********As diplomats and scholars begin to sift through voluminous speeches, articles and the comments of Vietnamese officials, they say it is apparent that the leadership faces factionalism within the party, a disgruntled army and, most important, a south that is still wayward and uncooperative. The south, in the view of some Hanoi officials, is the source of corruption, political deviation and ''many-faceted sabotage.'' **********''South Vietnam is in a state of moral secession,'' the party historian Thai Quang Trung, who is based in Paris, said in a meeting with journalists in Bangkok on Friday. **********Mr. Trung, an exile who is critical of Hanoi, said that within Vietnam the situation in the south was now being described by the Vietnamese aphorism, ''One thousand pounds hanging by a hair.'' A Sign of Deference **********According to Douglas Pike, the head of the Indochina Studies Program at the University of California at Berkeley and the editor of the periodical Indochina Chronology, the naming of Nguyen Van Linh as party chief is ''a clear sign of deference to the south.'' **********Mr. Linh, who replaced Truong Chinh as General Secretary of the party on Thursday, served for more than 40 years in southern Vietnam. He was first an underground Communist organizer, then a liaison with the southern-based Vietcong, which officials now decribe as a wing of Hanoi's Communist Party, and finally, after the fall of the south, an administrator of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. **********He was one of several important party officials with long experience in the south who were promoted during the congress last week or are expected, according to officials, to take high posts when the country's new Government lineup, as distinct from party lineup, is announced, probably before the end of the year. **********The others include Pham Hung, the second-ranking official in the party hierachy, who may become head of the State Council, or President; Vo Chi Cong, who is in line to become Prime Minister; Vo Van Kiet, the head of national planning, and Mai Chi Tho, a security expert who was a popular and effective mayor of Ho Chi Minh City. These men have also been associated with experiments in economic liberalization. Curbs on Repression Seen **********''This may bring an end, or a scaling down, of more repressive measures against the south,'' Mr. Pike said in a telephone interview. **********''In 1975, Hanoi's initial instinct had been to go slow on the south,'' he said. ''But before the end of that year they decided to opt instead for total and immediate integration. 'Breaking the machine,' they called it. What you may be seeing now is a redressing of this. **********''They may have made the decision that they really need the south,'' Mr. Pike said. Mr. Trung believes that the Politburo is heavily weighted with people who are thought to know ''how to deal with southerners - capitalists, Buddhists, Catholics, all sorts of people.'' **********Vietnamese news organizations have begun to reflect a new attitude. A week ago, when Vo Tran Chi, the party secretary for Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, spoke to the Congress, the official Hanoi radio described the former southern capital as ''a dynamic example of economic development for provinces throughout the country,'' according to a translation by the monitoring service of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Specific Economic Requests **********Mr. Chi then proceeded to give a speech almost free of jargon and very specific in its economic requests -more electricity to power a recovery, for example, and more qualified personnel to speed development. **********If the south can finally be pacified, while contributing its agricultural, manufacturing and management skills to national development, experts say, the new leadership of Hanoi will have a major achievement to its credit. **********Problems with the army have some roots in the economy, according to military publications. Both Mr. Trung and Mr. Pike, the author of a new history, ''P.A.V.N.: People's Army of Vietnam,'' believe that the army is probably the country's strongest and least divided institution at this point, and that its concerns must be addressed. **********Early this month, a few days before the opening of the party congress, Quan Doi Nhan Dan, the army daily newspaper, complained of a lack of attention to the needs of troops. It portrayed a fighting force facing China that lacked warm clothes and lived on boiled potatoes while sleeping in crowded tents. Morale Has Declined **********In Cambodia, where officials have acknowledged problems of indiscipline and desertion compounded by malaria and many casualties from land mines, morale has declined, military pubications say. **********Diplomats and other observers of the Vietnamese military are not convinced, however, that the departure from the Politburo last week of the country's Defense Minister, Senior Gen. Van Tien Dung, reflects problems between the party and army. His removal is thought by some to have a strictly political cause. **********General Dung was thought to be close to Le Duc Tho, who also lost his Politburo seat last week, and to Le Duan, the party General Secretary who died in July. Mr. Chinh, who replaced Mr. Duan, had been a bitter rival of his predecessor for many years. Mr. Linh, who now takes over, was a protege of Mr. Chinh, and therefore it is thought that he may have helped engineer the dismissal of General Dung as Defense Minister. **********Scholars say the existence of continued party factionalism is hard to prove. But Mr. Trung said some evidence, which he did not provide in detail, is emerging from Hanoi that indicates that Mr. Chinh made a last-minute attempt to keep the top party post but lost both that bid and a subsequent one to stay in the Politburo. **********According to Mr. Trung's analysis, a deadlock over Mr. Chinh's future was broken by the simultaneous resignation of Mr. Chinh and Le Duc Tho, who was considered an ally of Le Duan. **********Pham Van Dong, the country's Prime Minister, who also resigned, was in ill health and had been expected to retire."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/18/business/washington-watch-shad-said-to-be-leaving.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1986-08-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Washington Watch; Shad Said to Be Leaving", "print_headline": "Washington Watch; Shad Said to Be Leaving", "body_text": " **********John S.

Christopher Whittle in Whittle Communications, Knoxville, Tenn. **********In addition to being one of two vice chairmen, Mr. Greenberg will be president of the newest of five divisions - a division that at the moment consists of nothing. **********It is his job to fill that void. Mr. Whittle, the chairman, explained on a visit to New York yesterday that the company wants the division to come up with a medium combining the mandatory assets of a Whittle property: exclusivity for an advertiser, no advertising clutter and a targeted audience as well as the tougher goal of bringing in revenues of $30 million to $50 million a year. **********''I think it's a dream job and a big challenge,'' said Mr. Greenberg. **********''I think there will be a lot of sparks,'' added Mr. Whittle. **********At present the Whittle organization has 25 media properties. The largest of these racks up $9 million, and the average is $4 million. **********What has to be stressed, Mr. Whittle made clear, is that a medium is not necessarily a publication. **********The company is doing very well with a basic medium it chooses to call an information center, which is actually a glorified poster that goes up on college campuses or in physicians' lounges in hospitals. **********Many (21) other Whittle properties are single-sponsor publications of weekly or quarterly frequency. There are also newsletters, and videotapes are in the planning stage. **********For Mr. Greenberg, a 1972 graduate of the University of Tennessee, the move to Whittle will be a return because the 1330 Corporation was his first job in the world of media. In 1977 he was invited to 1330 by Mr. Whittle and Phillip Moffitt, founders and Tennessee graduates, who knew of him by reputation.

But happily ever after eluded them. **********''In 1981 Phillip and I were in deep trouble at Esquire,'' Mr. Whittle recalled yesterday, ''so we asked Alan to run it. From 1981 to 1986 he did the best job of turning around a magazine. Everyone agrees. The magazine had 400 pages of advertising the year he started and had 1,300 last year. Revenues at the same time went from $6 million to $40 million.'' **********Nine months ago Mr. Greenberg was promoted to group publisher, which gave him additional responsibility for the new New York Woman magazine and the Esquire health and fitness division, which maintains glorified posters, or information centers, in health clubs. **********But the job, he said, was largely selling advertising space. **********On July 1 the previous partners, Mr. Whittle and Mr. Moffitt, went their separate ways, each taking part of their holdings. Mr. Moffitt, the editor side of the combo, took the three Esquire businesses, the former, 1330. Mr. Greenberg stayed with Esquire. The Dec. 1 switch, he said, ''is a move driven by opportunity.'' **********His vice chairman's title is in Whittle Communications Inc., the holding company. The other vice chairman is Nicholas W.

It also persuaded Israel to do the same, the sources said. **********The operation, which has been going on for more than a year and a half, was also intended to provide the Administration with a way of addressing, and perhaps influencing, relations between Teheran and Washington once the rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ends, another intelligence source said. He described the effort as ''prudent,'' an apparent reference to Washington's desire to help moderate elements gain control of the Iranian Government. **********The information on the operation followed statements by Iranian officials on Monday that Robert C. McFarlane, the former national security adviser to Mr. Reagan, had made a secret trip to Teheran in an effort to gain the hostages' release. **********Reports Termed 'Fanciful' **********Mr. McFarlane, who has declined to comment on the report, said today that there had been ''fanciful'' reports on his activities but added that he was not able to correct the ''considerable misinformation'' at this time. **********''I'm in the awkward position of not being able to comment on the reports,'' he told reporters after giving a speech in Highland Heights, Ohio. ''They're very fanciful, largely fictitious issues. And I'll comment on them when the time is appropriate.'' **********Mr. McFarlane added that the public would soon learn that the Administration had adhered to its policy of not providing arms to Iran as long as it believes Iran aids terrorism. Description of Operation **********The intelligence specialists, who are familiar with the shipments but who asked not to be identified, described the operation as one of several actions taken by the Administration in a highly secret program that was directed by a small group in the National Security Council at the White House. **********In this operation, they said, the United States provided the direct shipment of parts that had been bought by Iran but not sent after an arms embargo was imposed in 1979. **********A White House spokesman, Dan Howard, described the embargo as a ''very technical business'' and said he did not know if it included spare parts. **********In April 1980, President Jimmy Carter expanded a November 1979 executive order freezing Iranian assets in the United States to void any contracts or licenses granted before that date involving ''the sale, supply or other transfer'' by any person in United States jurisdiction of ''items, commodities or products'' to Iran except for food, medicine and donated clothing. The order does not specifically refer to military spare parts. In addition to direct shipments by the United States, the intelligence specialists said, the Administration sought to encourage third parties to provide similar shipments, with one such channel being Israel. **********Neither the White House nor the State Department would indicate if direct arms shipments to Iran violated the arms embargo. **********President Reagan declined to comment when asked today if the United States had made some sort of deal with Iran to gain the hostages' release. But he appealed to reporters not to speculate, saying it was ''making it more difficult for us in our effort get the other hostages free.'' Statement by Weinberger **********Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger told a group of reporters today that the United States had not changed its policy against supplying military spare parts to Iran. Although the United States has an official policy of neutrality in the Iran-Iraq war, Mr. Weinberger said it was not to Washington's advantage to have Teheran win its six-year-old war against Baghdad. **********Pete Roussel, a White House spokesman, said the United States had systematically urged other countries not to sell arms to Iran. **********The intelligence sources said the operation had been run within the National Security Council because of White House concern that, if the Central Intelligence Agency handled it, the C.I.A. would be required to brief Congressional intelligence committees and that Congressional officials would then disclose the plan. **********One National Security Council official who is believed to have been involved is Lieut. Col. Oliver North, a specialist in counterinsurgency and terrorism, who Administration officials have said was in Cyprus last weekend when David P. Jacobsen, one of the American hostages, was released from Lebanon. **********A ranking Administration official said that there had been discussion in the White House about the belief that the Iranian military might be willing to improve relations with the United States in the hope of receiving needed spare parts and that Washington could take advantage of this desire. **********The sources said the operation has generated some internal debate in the Administration, with the State Department, for example, raising objections recently to a policy that essentially involved trading arms for hostages. One specific State Department concern, they said, was that it would incur the resentment of moderate Arabs, who would become upset that the United States was using Israel to supply military equipment to Iran. **********The Los Angeles Times, quoting unnamed Administration sources, reported today that both Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger were angered by the shipments. **********The sources said that since the operation began, the Administration had, at times, backed away from expediting the shipments, but that in each instance the plan was reinstated at White House insistence - ''because it worked,'' one source said. Iran's Mediation in Hijacking **********According to the sources, the operation intensified after the hijacking in June 1985 of a Trans World Airlines airliner, when Iran intervened with the Islamic Holy War group to free the Americans who were being held aboard. Iran's role became central after Syria proved unable to influence the Shiite faction in Lebanon, a turn of events that served to reinforce the Administration's belief that Teheran held the answer to gaining the release of the other Americans in Lebanon. **********While the Administration's policy has been to reject making concessions to or negotiating with terrorists, White House officials have indicated that it is not opposed to conducting talks that could gain the release of the remaining American captives. **********The operation, however, would appear to contradict the Administration's policy of not dealing with governments that sponsor terrorism, as it has charged Iran does. It would also appear in contrast to other policy positions, such as the attempt by the Administration to put pressure on friendly governments to isolate those supporting terrorism. July 4 Flight Reported **********One Iranian source said a plane had arrived at Teheran's Mehrabad Airport at 5:30 A.M. on July 4 carrying an American delegation and arms, apparently as a part of the operation. **********There have been several reports suggesting Israeli involvement in shipments to Iran. In September 1985, for example, a cargo plane flying from Iran to Spain made an unscheduled landing in Tel Aviv after reporting that it had developed communications trouble, Turkish authorities said then. In that month, the Rev.

[ Page A12. ]  Mr. Reagan's 27-minute speech, which the nation's three major networks declined to carry live, was marked by an appeal to Democrats, in which the President noted the dangerous ''consequences'' of Soviet involvement in Nicaragua, and by an acknowledgement of concern by Mr. Reagan about allegations of corruption and human rights abuses by the contras. **********Corruption Charges Rebutted **********The State Department, also worried about the effect on the House vote of the corruption charges, responded to the accusations.

The article was based on interviews with the former rebel officers. **********''The source for The New York Times story was Juan Rivera,'' Mr. Abrams said at his news conference. ''We figured that out.'' In fact, however, Mr. Rivera, a former aide to the contra military commander, Enrique Bermudez, was not interviewed and has never spoken with the Times correspondent who wrote the article.

Initial Report Was Not Confirmed **********There is every indication that the Kremlin was caught unaware by the fighting. On Jan. 13, the day the clashes broke out, the Soviet Government press agency Tass quoted the Aden radio as having said that an attempt to kill President Ali Nasser Mohammed al-Hassani had failed and that the coup leaders, including former president Abdel Fattah Ismail, who returned last year from a five-year exile in the Soviet Union, had been executed. **********The report proved unconfirmed, and the Soviet press fell silent for two days while the Kremlin tried to sort out what was happening. When reports resumed, they told of heavy fighting and destruction, and said that information on the whereabouts of senior officials was contradictory. **********Soviet press reports since have been scanty. In reporting the evacuation of foreigners, for example, the Soviet press did not say that many of them were Russians. **********Three Southern Yemeni officials -Prime Minister Haider Abu Bakr al-Attas, Foreign Minister Abdel Aziz al-Dali and Trade Minister Ahmed Obeid al-Fadhli - who were abroad when the fighting began have been in the Soviet Union since then. Yemenis Abroad Issue Appeals **********From Moscow, they have been issuing appeals to their country over Tass. Western diplomats say the statements appear to be an attempt by the Soviet Government to establish at least a minimal influence over the situation. Western diplomats said that the Southern Yemeni officials had been cautious in their own assessments of the situation in the absence of any firm information from Aden. **********Their first statement was issued Saturday ''on behalf of'' Southern Yemeni leaders visiting in the Soviet Union, East Germany, Bulgaria and Syria. It appealed to the combatants inside Southern Yemen to stop the bloodshed and ''foil the plans of class enemies.'' **********On Monday, the Southern Yemenis issued appeals to the Palestine Liberation Organization, to the President of Yemen, which is north of Southern Yemen, and to the Arab League opposing the possible use of Palestinians as a peacekeeping force in Southern Yemen. Such a possibility is said to have been discussed by President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen and Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. leader, who was visiting Yemen. **********The appeals issued by the Southern Yemeni officials over Tass warned of ''dangerous consequences'' if Palestinians or other outside forces were to enter Southern Yemen. The appeals said that the strife was an ''internal affair concerning only our party and our country.'' Aim Is to Limit the Conflict **********Western diplomats said the appeal suggested concern that the injection of outside forces could fan the conflict and spread it outside Southern Yemen. The Soviet Union's immediate goal is evidently to prevent any expansion of the conflict, and to insure that whatever faction comes out on top remains aligned with Moscow. **********Efforts by Ambassador Vladislav P. Zhukov of the Soviet Union to mediate between the factions appear to have failed, and for the time being, the Kremlin has been limited to issuing pleas through the Southern Yemeni officials stranded in Moscow and to working with Britain and France in evacuating Soviet dependents. **********Moscow's anxiety over the situation in Aden evidently derives both from the fact that in addition to Syria and Libya, Southern Yemen is a key political ally in the Arab world, and from the fact that the Soviet Union maintains military facilities and at least 1,000 men in Southern Yemen. **********Although one of the reported coup leaders, Mr. Ismail, is a doctrinaire Marxist and spent years in exile in Moscow, Western diplomats believe that the Soviet Union has preferred the more moderate President Hassani, possibly because he was seen as more responsive to Soviet wishes. Attempt at Reconciliation **********Mr. Ismail's return home from his Soviet exile last year was viewed by diplomats as an effort by Moscow to reconcile political opponents. The former President returned in time for a congress of the Yemeni Socialist Party, the ruling Marxist party, and the Russians seemed satisfied that he was restored to a party position. At that congress, Ambassador Zhukov endorsed President Hassani in a televised address. **********The Soviet policy in the Arabian Peninsula has been to seek improved relations with moderate governments and ultimately to establish relations with Saudi Arabia. President Hassani, a pragmatic leader who worked to improve ties with his neighbors and with the West, seemed to suit the Soviet intentions. **********But Southern Yemeni internal politics has been violent almost from the time the country received independence from Britain in 1967. The first coup was two years later. Mr. Ismail came to power in another coup in 1978, and it was under him that a 20-year friendship treaty was signed with the Soviet Union, granting it military bases. Hassani Took Office in 1980 **********Mr. Ismail's extremism, however, proved detrimental to Soviet interests, and in 1980 he was forced out by Mr. Hassani. The ousted President settled in Moscow ''for health reasons.'' It is not clear whether his exile was self-imposed or enforced. **********Diplomats say the Soviet Union evidently underestimated the power of tribal rivalries. Although information has been sparse, it appears that the initial coup attempt has developed into a tribal conflict, with the Soviet-equipped armed forces divided in their loyalties. **********Moscow's cautious reports suggest that the Russians are not clear who is gaining the upper hand. **********One unusual aspect of Moscow's plight, and one possible reason for the reticence of the Soviet press, is that the Soviet Union cannot blame the United States or any other ''outside force'' for the fighting. Normally, one of the Soviet Union's first reactions is to hint at Washington's hand in situations of this sort. **********The United States has had no relations with Southern Yemen since October 1969, and the power struggle this time pits two factions professing allegiance to Moscow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/17/business/opec-set-to-discuss-strategies.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1986-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OPEC SET TO DISCUSS STRATEGIES", "print_headline": "OPEC SET TO DISCUSS STRATEGIES", "body_text": " **********The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, after holding two preliminary sessions today, is expected to start Monday to try to devise a strategy to deal with plunging oil prices and a diminishing share of the world oil market, in what may be a weeklong emergency session. **********Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, the conference president and Venezuelan oil minister, said that ministers from OPEC's 13 member nations would begin closed-door discussions on Monday on ''the fair share of the market that OPEC is willing to defend'' and ''the level of prices.'' **********He added, ''All the ministers are concerned about avoiding a price war and maintaining a reasonable level of prices.'' Mr. Hernandez briefed reporters after the meetings, which were held in a conference room on the 18th floor of the Inter-Continental Hotel here, overlooking Lake Geneva. Policy Changed in December **********OPEC decided in principle in December to abandon its official policy of trying to defend a $28-a-barrel oil price through cuts in output, which all its members were flouting. Instead, OPEC decided to try to protect a fixed share of the world oil market by cutting the prices its members charged to secure more sales. **********The effect of that decision and an increase in production by the organization's largest producer, Saudi Arabia, was an almost free fall of prices to about $14 a barrel and a disastrous decline in revenues for OPEC members. OPEC output now accounts for about a third of world production, down from two-thirds in the late 1970's. **********The dimension of the problem was underscored today by a report of the group's Market Monitoring Committee, which forecast that demand for OPEC oil in the second quarter would likely total between 15 million and 16 million barrels a day, compared with an average OPEC production of 18.2 million barrels a day in this year's first quarter. If production and demand are not brought back into balance, prices could fall further. **********Trying to come up with a new policy that would satisfy all OPEC members will be difficult, though. Waiting for Non-OPEC Members **********Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, asked before the start of the meeting whether he thought the time had come for a return to production allocations, replied, ''We will explore all the possibilities.'' **********But in a British newspaper interview published today to coincide with the start of the conference, he emphasized that Saudi Arabia is not yet prepared to surrender to those who favor new OPEC production quotas without waiting for non-OPEC oil producers to cut back on their output. **********Indeed, one conference official who asked not to be identified said that while unanimity emerged today on goals, there was little agreement on ''ways and means'' to achieve them. **********Kuwait, which has been among Mr. Yamani's staunchest supporters, said today it would be willing to reverse its previous stand and accept a limit on OPEC production if all 13 members agreed to such a move. Other delegates said the Kuwaiti announcement represented more of an effort to stir a spirit of compromise than a chink in the Saudi armor. 'Disaster Lies Ahead' **********In order to achieve what it considers its ''fair market'' share of world oil sales and a rise in prices, OPEC must get some major non-OPEC producers, including Britain and Norway, to reduce output. **********In the interview in The Sunday Telegraph, Sheik Yamani said that British refusal to cooperate with OPEC meant that ''disaster lies ahead'' and that prices ''could drop as low as $8 a barrel.'' **********He continued: ''I don't say that is probable. But it is possible.'' **********Sheik Yamani warned of the possibility of ''political upheavals, sparked off by financial collapses, due to this huge sudden slump in oil prices,'' adding: ''The best and perhaps the only way to ward this off is for the non-OPEC producers, and above all Britain and Norway, to cooperate in price control.'' **********The minister said that, despite previous British refusals, ''I don't despair of getting some talks going afterwards, perhaps in London.'' 'An Ugly War' **********Other Gulf ministers have supported Saudi Arabia's stand and said they would cooperate in production cuts if Britain did as well. And Mani Said al-Otaiba, the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, warned that failure to cooperate could push the price to ''something less than $10.'' **********Describing the present market chaos as ''a war, an ugly war,'' he said, ''Then we will regret that we didn't take the chance of defending the market at $15 a barrel.'' **********If cooperation from non-OPEC members is forthcoming, it will likely surface in a session on Wednesday attended by representatives of Mexico, Egypt, Malaysia, Brunei and Oman. Britain and Norway have so far refused to discuss output demands with OPEC. **********But even those talks may not result in stabilizing the oil market. Indications of how strong the opposition is to Saudi Arabia's management of the crisis came today in an early effort by Iran, which with Algeria and Libya has been among the forceful Saudi opponents, to unseat Mr. Hernandez as conference president and elect in his place the Libyan oil minister, Fawzi al-Shakshuki. Pressure on Populous States **********The effort failed when Saudi Arabia, though not particularly enamored of Mr. Hernandez's hesitant leadership, threw support behind him. But the force of the Iranian attack was underscored by one official who said the Venezuelan was re-elected ''by the skin of his teeth.'' **********Opponents of the Saudi course argue that the decline in oil prices of more than 50 percent since late last year is badly hurting OPEC's highly populous and heavily indebted members, such as Nigeria and Venezuela, who depend largely on oil sales for export revenues. **********Several delegations have said they would make proposals for production cuts to more nearly equate supply and demand and firm up prices. Ecuadorean officials said they would broach a production cut of two million barrels per day to lift prices to an average $20 per barrel. **********Other officials, however, said the problem was less of supply and demand than of market psychology. **********''The market fundamentals, if you look at them, are more or less in balance regarding consumption and demand,'' Indonesia's oil minister, Subroto, said. But he said the market ''perceives that there is a confrontation'' within OPEC that was depressing prices. **********Discussing OPEC's ''fair share'' of the market, Dr. Subroto seemed to favor proposals put forth by other ministers, including Mr. Hernandez, that the organization pursue a flexible policy, depending on seasonal demand. ''Market share is a dynamic concept in a particular situation, always related to supply and demand,'' Dr. Subroto said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/world/2-sides-hopeful-as-sri-lanka-talks-end.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 558, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 SIDES HOPEFUL AS SRI LANKA TALKS END", "print_headline": "2 SIDES HOPEFUL AS SRI LANKA TALKS END", "body_text": " **********Negotiations that participants describe as the most substantive ever to take place between the Sri Lankan Government and ethnic Tamils seeking regional autonomy ended tonight with both sides hoping they can now bring Tamil guerrillas into the peace process. **********''We have covered a lot of ground,'' a Tamil negotiator said.

Mr. Furmark did not return the reporter's phone call. Linked to New York Oilman **********Mr. Furmark's involvement in the oil business has included an association with a well-known New York oil dealer who is now dead, John Shaheen, according to business sources. Mr. Shaheen, who built a refinery in Newfoundland, was a Republican supporter and former client of Mr. Casey, and Mr. Furmark met Mr. Casey through Mr. Shaheen. In the mid-1970's Mr. Casey, then a lawyer in private practice in New York, represented Mr. Furmark. John Shaheen and Robert Shaheen are not believed to be related. **********Also in the 1970's, Mr. Furmark became a consultant to Ashland Oil, helping the company in an unsuccessful effort to purchase the Newfoundland refinery in conjunction with Roger Tamraz, according to public documents. Mr. Tamraz is a Lebanese businessman with ties to some members of the royal family of Saudi Arabia, according to business sources. **********In 1981 Mr. Furmark became president of a troubled oil company, Uni Refining, after it was taken over by Middle East interests with ties to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, according to public documents. **********It is not known how Mr. Khashoggi and Mr. Furmark became associated, but Mr. Furmark has told Congress that unidentified Canadian investors solicited by Mr. Khashoggi to help finance some of the Iranian purchases became upset when their advances of more than $10 million were not paid back earlier this year. Furmark's Role Is Unclear **********Mr. Furmark's role in the matter is unclear, according to Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine and a member of the intelligence panel. Mr. Furmark had no financial stake in the Iran deal. **********Mr. Furmark feared the dispute might result in public disclosure of the Iran dealings and went to see Mr. Casey, his former associate, according to sources familiar with the testimony of Mr. Casey and Mr. Furmark. Mr. Casey testified in closed session that his suspicions about diversion of the funds came from both an oblique reference by Mr. Furmark as well as surmises by C.I.A. officials, according to Government officials. **********Mr. Casey, after hearing of these concerns, went to see Vice Admiral John M. Poindexter, then the national security adviser, to ask him if he knew of any diversions, according to these sources. Mr. Poindexter said he would look into the matter but did not get back to Mr. Casey, the sources added. **********Around the same time, Mr. Casey has told Congress, he called Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, then a Poindexter aide, to his office, according to Congressional officials. Mr. Casey asked Mr. North, the officials said, if there was any improper C.I.A. involvement in third-party financing of the Nicaraguan rebels, but he did not ask Mr. North directly whether funds were being diverted from Iranian payments to the contras, as others had suggested. **********Mr. North replied no, Mr. Casey is said to have told Congress."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/02/business/l-boss-as-doctor-replies-973986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 230, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOSS AS DOCTOR: REPLIES", "print_headline": "BOSS AS DOCTOR: REPLIES", "body_text": " **********The article ''When the Boss Becomes Your Doctor'' (Jan. 5) -which described the increasing participation of companies in health care decisions through tighter management of health insurance programs -elicited an unusual number of responses.

Exports of pulp to Western Europe and Japan for paper-making were up 49 percent in January and February from the same period in 1985 largely because of the dollar's slide, according to the American Paper Institute. **********''We expect to see stronger export demand for paper and the raw material paper is made from,'' said Ronald J.

In fact, he said, the company's export orders for lumber were up 80 percent so far this year from a year ago, when business was depressed by the high dollar. **********Many of the industries that have not yet benefited from the drop in the dollar are looking for improved export markets later in the year. **********''It's not something that turns up immediately,'' said Richard E. Stober, a spokesman at the Caterpillar Tractor Company in Peoria, Ill. ''But it will put us on a more equal footing.'' **********Some companies with overseas subsidiaries are already benefiting in a different way, however. Their profits from the foreign units are worth more when translated into dollars, adding to the bottom line back home. This benefit began to show up in the fourth quarter of last year. **********But companies that set up plants overseas to make products or components for the United States market find themselves in the same position as foreign competitors: The goods they bring here will be more costly. Cuts Two Ways **********Jerry Saylor, manager of agricultural economic research at Deere & Company, said the falling dollar cuts two ways. As an exporter of agricultural and construction equipment, Deere becomes more competitive in world markets as the dollar gets weaker, he said. But Deere also imports machinery to the United States from factories overseas, including its own, and a lower dollar makes it ''disadvantageous to bring those machines in.'' **********In any event, it takes 18 to 24 months for the effects of the change in currency values to be seen in trade in a major way, said Stephen L. Cooney, director of international investment and finance at the National Association of Manufacturers. **********Moreover, many export markets remain depressed and some analysts believe that more economic growth must take place internationally before exports can show healthy gains. ''Not only the fall of the dollar is needed, but also a substantial return to growth around the world,'' Mr. Cooney said. **********Thomas Ambrose, a spokesman for the Weyerhaeuser Company of Tacoma, Wash., underscored this point. ''A lot depends on market strength,'' he said of export prospects for the company, which makes wood products. For example, he said, the Japanese housing market is ''a bit flat,'' and that is having an impact on orders to Japan. **********And Deere is not expecting much of an increase in exports of agricultural equipment because of depressed farm markets, according to Mr. Saylor. **********Still another factor affecting export levels is that the currencies of some other nations have also declined in value, often because they are pegged to the dollar. The trade advantages expected for the United States will be shared by these nations, including South Korea and Taiwan. **********Because these nations have remained competitive, the textile industry, for one, says it is not likely to get much help from a weaker dollar. **********Bryant A. Haskins, a spokesman for Burlington Industries, said that ''many of the countries presenting the biggest problems to us are Pacific Rim countries and their currencies are pegged to ours.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/business/credit-markets-little-help-seen-from-a-rate-cut.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1986-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 783, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LITTLE HELP SEEN FROM A RATE CUT", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; LITTLE HELP SEEN FROM A RATE CUT", "body_text": " **********Although anticipation of a cut in the discount rate has continued to fuel rallies in the credit markets, several economists are beginning to question whether the cut, which most now see as inevitable, will do much to stimulate the nation's sluggish economy. **********Their concern is that the sectors of the economy that respond most readily to a reduction in interest rates -housing and consumer spending -have already contributed what they can to overall economic growth as a result of rate cuts earlier this year. **********Even economists who expect a pickup in growth for the second half of 1986 agree that such growth can hardly be robust or sustained without marked improvement in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, and a rise in capital investment. These areas, the economists say, will benefit only marginally, if at all, from having the Federal Reserve Board lower interest rates another notch. **********''At this stage of the cycle, a decline in interest rates is necessary, but not very helpful,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Chase Econometrics, a forecasting concern based in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. ''The reason for the Fed to ease is to prevent the economy from getting any worse,'' he said, ''and there may be more than one round of easing ahead of us.'' Focusing on Trade Sector **********Mr. Chimerine, who expects the growth rate in the second half of the year to be a meager 2.5 percent or so, said the only real hope for better performance is improvement in the trade sector. Such improvement he said, will require further declines in the dollar against the Japanese yen, as well as currencies of other major United States trading partners. **********''Our trade problems are getting worse with Korea, Taiwan, Canada and the less-developed countries,'' he said. ''What we have gained in currency advantage with Japan and Europe we have been losing elsewhere.'' **********One factor that has dampened the near-term outlook, according to many economists, including Mr. Chimerine, is the pending tax legislation, which would eliminate numerous tax breaks six months or more before tax cuts would take effect and thus exert a drag on the economy. In addition, the legislation is nearly certain to kill the investment tax credit, which along with elimination of other corporate tax benefits is expected to further depress already weak investment in plant and equipment. **********Martin S. Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard University and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the combination of the fiscal drag from the tax bill and the reduction of the Federal budget deficit makes the outlook for the next 18 months highly uncertain. A Problem of Adjustment **********''In a sense, we've already seen the good news that comes from market expectations of a lower deficit - the reduction in interest rates and inflation expectations and a lower dollar,'' he said. ''Now we have to work through the bad news, which is the adjustment problem.'' **********Mr. Feldstein expressed concern about a mismatch in timing between the initial negative economic impact of the tax and budget policies and the improvements that he expects in the trade picture once the effects of a lower dollar begin to take hold. **********Even with a discount rate cut, Mr. Feldstein said, he expects a relatively slow 3 percent pace of economic growth in the second half of this year, with risks on the down side. **********Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University, said one reason the previous round of internationallly coordinated discount rate cuts had failed to produce more substantial growth in the American economy was that some of the stimulus they spurred in consumer spending was siphoned away for purchasing goods from abroad. ''We were the engine that was fueling everybody else, and now that our economy has slowed down so have those of our trading partners,'' he said. Japan's Possible Reaction **********Mr. Ratajczak, who is looking for growth of 3.5 percent in the second half, said he expects a discount rate cut ''because we want to drive the dollar down and scare the West Germans and the Japanese into stimulating their economies.'' He added that the best response from Japan would be not a discount rate cut of its own but rather substantial tax revision to bolster its consumer sector. **********Robert Dederick, chief economist for Chicago's Northern Trust Bank, noted that while nominal interest rates have fallen sharply, real rates remain relatively high, given the current low level of inflation. **********This, he said, gives purchasing managers little incentive to do any long-term inventory building that would translate into employment and industrial production increases."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/05/business/finance-new-issues-new-york-city-refunding-bonds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New York City Refunding Bonds", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; New York City Refunding Bonds", "body_text": " **********A $665 million issue of New York City refunding bonds was tentatively offered yesterday through a group of underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. **********Yields on the tax-exempt issue of general obligation bonds, Fiscal 1987 Series C, range from 4.4 percent for an issue due in 1988 to 5.5 percent in 1991, 6.5 percent in 1996, 7 percent in 2001, 7.25 percent in 2005 and 7.3 percent for the remainder of issues due in 2006 through 2016. **********Merrill Lynch officials said they expected ratings of Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and BBB+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********Proceeds from the sale will be used to refund various outstanding bonds sold in 1982 through 1985, some with interest rates as high as 13 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/04/business/factory-orders-rise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 391, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FACTORY ORDERS RISE", "print_headline": "FACTORY ORDERS RISE", "body_text": " **********United States factory orders rose in December by a sharp 2.7 percent over the November level, the biggest gain in more than a year, the Commerce Department reported today.

The index of leading economic indicators declined by six-tenths of 1 percent in January, which might lead someone to suppose that a recession lies around the corner. Immediately after that, total employment, an important ''coincident'' indicator that could signal a recession in progress, declined in February. And that bit of bearish news was followed on March 7 by a fall in the prime rate, an important lagging indicator, which might prove that a recession is already under way. **********To pessimists, it all adds up to a grim 1986 and beyond. In my view, however, that conclusion would be wrong and would go far to prove why we cannot put much credence in month-to-month blips in the indicators. It also calls into question the accuracy of the three economic indicators - leading, coincident and lagging - which were last updated in 1975. **********The United States can, in fact, look forward to stronger growth in 1986 than in 1985. The drop in the leading index was largely accounted for by one component, contracts and orders for plant and equipment. The February drop in employment, as reported in the survey of households, was partly accounted for by a weather-related decline in farm employment (the California rains), and in any case was contradicted by the rise in nonfarm employment as reported by employers. The drop in the prime rate was triggered by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut the discount rate to 7 percent from 7.5 percent. But this followed similar cuts by central banks in West Germany, France, the Netherlands and Japan, and reflected improved inflation prospects rather than general weakness. **********All this serves to illustrate that one can easily take a too simplistic view of the economic indicators, which are useful tools when used with care and an awareness of their imperfections. The leading indicators sometimes foreshadow downturns by a year or more, sometimes by only a few months. They sometimes emit false signals, suggesting recession when all that occurs is a slowdown. Perhaps most significant, the economy keeps changing, so that a given set of indicators may not be as useful as it once was. New indicators emerge from the statistical mills, and we learn more about how the economy works. **********We may have reached such a point today. No indicator system, once established, should be left as is forever. Every 10 years or so, it needs a thorough review. This year, the Center for International Business Cycle Research is conducting another review, with financial support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and full cooperation from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which publishes the indicators. The objective is to re-evaluate the existing indicators, develop new ones and make the system more reflective of the economy we now have. **********Here are some of the improvements that we can look forward to: *********** Better coverage of the service industries, which now provide nearly three-fourths of the jobs in the country and more than half of the output. We need to give somewhat greater weight in the indicators to the service industries and a little less to manufacturing. *********** More emphasis on foreign trade volume and prices, foreign credit and capital flows and economic indicators for other countries. At $150 billion, the trade deficit in 1985 did much greater damage to the economy than it did 10 years ago. And import prices obviously have a greater effect on domestic demand and on the inflation rate than they did a decade ago. We need to take fuller account of these things in the indicators. *********** New leading indicators, including a new index of industrial materials prices, an improved measure of layoff rates, a monthly ratio of selling prices to unit labor costs and an index that shows how widespread the trends are in the leading indicators in various industries or across the country. *********** A group of new leading indicators such as bond prices or the ratio of sales to inventories, which detect trends even sooner than the existing indicators, as well as a new set of leading indicators for inflation. *********** More up-to-date figures on inventory changes, among the leading indicators, and on sales of consumer goods and capital goods, among the coincident indicators. Inventory changes might be more quickly detected if we used the National Association of Purchasing Managers survey. Retail sales and capital goods sales are available more promptly than total sales, the figure we now use as an estimate in the first set of coincident indicators. By concentrating on figures that are available the first time the indexes are released, revisions will be less of a problem. **********The indicators have many deficiencies that cannot be fixed and never will be. Because they do not all move in the same direction, you have to decide what the dominant tendency is. The big increase in the February unemployment rate, for example, will probably not prove consistent with the other data. And we all want data promptly. But the price of getting it quickly is incomplete information, which is subject to revision. **********Nevertheless, it is worth trying to fix what we can, because the indicators have a long record of successful performance behind them. The accompanying chart shows, for example, how they helped to distinguish the ''growth recession'' of 1984 and 1985, when economic growth falls below its long-term rate, from a real recession, when the economy actually contracts. **********The chart compares the performance of the leading index in the three previous growth recessions with both its current performance and its behavior in the seven previous real recessions. While both types of recessions are preceded by a slowdown in the leading index, a divergence soon appears that distinguishes the real recessions from their milder cousins. The current pattern resembles the growth recession scenario more closely than the other. That was a helpful and accurate diagnosis. **********The leading indicators work because they reflect decisions that subsequently affect production and employment, or because they measure factors that influence such decisions. The volume of new orders is a leading indicator because in many industries production is geared to the receipt of orders. The average workweek is a more sensitive indicator than aggregate employment, because it is usually easier to change the length of the workweek than to hire and fire employees. **********Each of the leading indicators was selected for sound reasons and for good performance over time. In the case of stock prices, for example, the record covers more than a century and more than 20 business cycles. Moreover, studies of the same indicators in other market-oriented countries have shown similar results when tested on entirely new sets of data.

''How can we forget our homes and our lands?'' **********The loss of peasant supporters is a serious blow to the guerrillas, who depend on the villagers to provide them food, shelter and intelligence. But the capture of more than 2,000 guerrilla backers in the last year and a half has also caused problems for the Government because it does not appear to know what to do with them. Promises and Reality **********The uncertain futures of those captured by the army as well as those displaced by the war are one indication of how the Christian Democratic Government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte has fallen short of the promises of change that it made on taking office two years ago. **********There is no effective Government program to assist these captives from rebel villages, or the more than 300,000 other refugees who clot the grimy towns in Government control. **********''There are all kinds of Government programs on paper, but nothing that works,'' said an international relief official who has worked extensively with the Government. ''The refugee problem just goes on.'' **********The peasants captured for supporting the guerrillas represent an especially difficult challenge for the Government. Winning their sympathy will be extremely hard. **********The villagers have been rounded up in army counterinsurgency campaigns that are intended to separate guerrilla sympathizers from armed rebel units. It is an unpleasant business. The army enters selected guerrilla areas and burns the peasants' fields, wrecks their homes and seizes anyone it can catch, according to evidence seen by reporters and to refugee accounts. Camps Outside the Capital **********The army usually hands the rebel supporters to the Red Cross, which turns them over to the Roman Catholic Church. The church then puts them in crowded camps like Calle Real, a neat but desolate row of barracks on the northern outskirts of San Salvador. About 700 people, almost all of them rounded up as guerrilla supporters, live at the camp. **********Without homes, money or a Government identity card, these people face a harsh future. They cannot leave to find work. As sympathizers of the guerrillas, they say, they may be killed or jailed if they wander into the towns. **********The refugees have few warm words for the army. There have been no reliable reports of army massacres in almost two years, but the peasants complain of aerial bombardment and the burning of their fields. They also admit they support the guerrillas. **********''We would have beaten this army if it was not for you Americans and the planes and guns you have given it,'' one villager, who would give his name only as Moises, said bitterly. **********Those peasants in the Calle Real camp whom the army captured on the Guazapa volcano, a major rebel base, can see their former home jutting into the sky just a few miles from the refugee center. On the day of a reporter's visit, they gathered to watch the air force bomb the great slab of volcanic rock and spoke of diving into shelters to avoid such attacks in the past. Meeting With a Rebel **********A few unarmed guerrillas and rebel militiamen have filtered through some of the refugee camps, captured with their families by the army. A reporter was surprised to meet one he had traveled with last year during a trip through guerrilla territory. **********Now the rebel said he was not sure he would return to fight again. He was worried, he said, about his wife and children. But he added that he remained loyal to the rebel movement. **********The fact that soldiers did not kill a peasant man of military age captured in rebel territory is a sign that the army has stopped its worse abuses. But the rebel did not seem very grateful. He contended that the troops who caught him beat him and threatened him with death before a priest interceded and helped him get to a refugee camp, which he has since left. **********''After they beat me, they came back and said they wanted to talk to me again,'' the rebel said with a touch of grim humor. ''But I told them no, that I felt I talked to them enough that day.'' Crowds for the TV **********Like all refugee camps in El Salvador, Calle Real is full of children, many of whose fathers are probably guerrillas or dead. Until they were carried out of rebel-held areas a few months ago, they had never switched on a light bulb at night, watched television or ridden in a car. Such conveniences are not part of life in a war zone. **********So when the two American nuns who administer the Calle Real camp turn on the camp television, a large crowd promptly gathers. No matter how banal the subject matter, curious faces peer at the screen to stare at a world they have never seen. **********Five children accept the offer of a short ride in a visitor's car and hang on with grim determination as they tilt down a hill. It is a bit like a horse, one of them says, only smoother. All agree it is a superior way to travel. **********Nobody seems to know what will happen to these people. Government officials, church officials, American officials, army officers, even the guerrillas themselves have no ready answer. **********Some may eventually be resettled on plots of land bought by the church. Some will probably hang on in the camps. Many say they want to go home, and a few may try to slip back into rebel areas. For now, the refugees line up for food at meal times and stare at the mountains."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/10/business/mcdonald-s-switching-to-old-coke-formula.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 467, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McDONALD'S SWITCHING TO 'OLD' COKE FORMULA", "print_headline": "McDONALD'S SWITCHING TO 'OLD' COKE FORMULA", "body_text": " **********Coca-Cola Classic has been given a resounding vote of confidence, at the expense of ''new'' Coke.

Doubts on New Coke **********But analysts are increasingly dubious. ''Given that McDonald's and the consumer are moving to old Coke, you just have to assume that Coca-Cola will take a hard look at new Coke,'' said Martin Romm, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation. ''They don't want it to be tagged a loser. If it's tagged a loser, the longer it's out there, the greater the potential harm it can do to other products.'' **********Coca-Cola introduced the sweeter-tasting new formula of Coke a year ago in an attempt to compete with Pepsico's Pepsi, which was challenging Coke's lead. At the same time, it dropped its traditional Coke formula. **********However, after vociferous boycotts and consumer protests, traditional Coke was brought back two months later under the new name of Coca-Cola Classic. After Coca-Cola's about-face, many marketing analysts called Coca-Cola's introduction of new Coke a major marketing blunder. **********McDonald's and Hardee's follow Kentucky Fried Chicken, which has 4,600 restaurants.

The longest vacation he ever took was six weeks - and that was 30 years ago. Normally, he allows himself only two weeks a year. **********Even so, Mr. Ferris balks at being labeled a workaholic. ''I don't think there is such a thing,'' he says. ''I've never been a workhorse. But I like to be busy.'' **********Mr. Ferris, like countless others, found himself without a job in 1932, when S.W. Strauss & Company, a New York real estate and investment firm for which he managed the Washington office, folded. He and two other ex-Strauss employees decided to start their own firm by wooing some of the former Strauss clients. **********But then came Franklin D. Roosevelt's inaugural address in 1933. The new President proclaimed: ''There must be strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments, so that there will be an end to speculation with other people's money.'' **********Mr. Ferris's partners thought those words spelled doom for investment banking.

The key to success in the investment world, Mr. Ferris contends, is not aggressiveness, but ''good common sense and good health and the ability to foresee conditions and determine by studying a company whether it will be successful. It's almost an instinct.'' Have there been mistakes along the way? Perhaps not - or perhaps Mr. Ferris's memory has conveniently faded. ''I don't remember any blunders,'' he says.

Stern, co-head of the primary markets group at Shearson Lehman Brothers, who related the story, ''is the kind of half it's been for the Street.'' **********Indeed, the volume of financings underwritten by Wall Street firms has soared to such unprecedented levels in the first six months of 1986 that investment bankers might routinely think of millions where before it was thousands, or billions instead of millions. **********Corporations raised a record $142.3 billion in capital by issuing stock or debt securities during the half, according to the Securities Data Company. That six-month figure was slightly higher than the underwritings done in all of 1985, which had been by far the biggest year for underwritings in Wall Street history. **********Salomon in the Lead **********''There were single months in the first half that seemed as good as entire years used to be,'' said Harold Tanner, co-head of corporate finance at Salomon Brothers, which underwrote more securities domestically in the first half, $28.7 billion worth, than any other firm, according to Securities Data. **********Driving this trend were the booming stock market and the sharp decline in interest rates, which brought corporations to the market in droves to dip into what seemed a bottomless well of capital, made available by institutional investors and the public. With long-term interest rates falling to their lowest level in nine years, numerous corporations leaped at the opportunity to lock in those lower rates. **********However, as many corporation officials emphasized, the bulk of the financings were used to refinance older, higher cost borrowings, rather than for growth because of the generally lackluster economy. **********For instance, the General Motors Corporation issued $500 million in 30-year bonds in April, its first such major financing since 1975. And E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company issued $300 million in 30-year bonds, carrying an interest rate of 8 1/2 percent, the first time in a decade that it found interest rates attractive enough to sell such a long-term security. 'Awfully Attractive' **********''Frankly, we haven't seen rates like that for years and it was awfully attractive,'' said William L. Flaherty, manager of corporate finance at Du Pont. He added that most of the proceeds were used to refinance outstanding debt securities that carried rates of more than 12 percent. **********The same was true for the equity markets, where some companies issued stock for the first time in decades. Citicorp raised slightly less than $300 million with an offering in June, its first visit to the stock market for capital since the 1920's. **********''It was the first time that most of us here had ever done an equity deal,'' said Donald S. Howard, the bank's chief financial officer. ''The overall stock market was at an all-time high so it looked attractive.'' **********The half also saw the development of several significant trends, which represented important changes in the financing business and an explosive reawakening of corporations to various financing options. **********First, after several years of concocting innovative and often complicated new financing products in an attempt to lure reluctant corporate borrowers to the capital market, investment banks found themselves dealing in huge amounts of ''plain vanilla'' bonds and common stock. **********''Why try to sell a client heavenly hash when what he's really looking for is plain vanilla?'' Mr. Stern explained. Longer-Term Securities **********Another shift was the relatively heavy flow of longer-term securities, such as the 30-year bonds. In the last six years especially, when interest rates soared to punishingly high levels, most corporations refused to lock themselves into long-term obligations in the expectation that interest levels had to fall eventually. They were richly rewarded for that wait this year. **********And much of the heavy flow of debt securities represented refinancings by corporations eager for a chance to replace costly debt issued at rates that at times approached 20 percent. **********The Upjohn Company has just raised $200 million by issuing 10-year bonds at 8 percent, its first trip to the market since 1981. The funds will be used to refinance a 14 percent issue. **********''The driving force for us was to lower our interest expense,'' said William U. Parfet, the Michigan-based pharmaceutical company's chief financial officer. ''We think that interest rates will go lower yet, but they could also go higher, and we decided it was not worth taking a chance.'' **********And some companies conceded that they did not even have any particular need for the capital they raised, but found interest rates so attractive they issued securities anyway. 'An Opportune Time' **********''We had no real need for cash when we did our offering,'' said Warren Hollinshead, director of corporate finance at Westinghouse, which sold $300 million of 10-year notes at a rate of 7 3/4 percent. ''We had set our sights on 7 3/4 percent and said that if rates fall that far, we'll do it. It was an opportune time.'' **********Robert G. Scott, head of bond underwritings at Morgan Stanley & Company, said, ''I'll bet you that virtually 90 percent of the debt underwritings from the first half came as opportunistic moves by corporations.'' **********And the equity market came back to life after a dismal stretch over the previous two years. Companies that had not issued stock in years sold equity, or bonds convertible into equity, in huge amounts. **********In addition, the market gave an ebullient welcome to several initial public offerings. For example, The Henley Group, a grab-bag of 38 companies spun off by Allied-Signal this year, tentatively planned to sell $200 million worth of stock, but demand was so great that $1.2 billion was sold. Europeans Taking Part **********The jump in stock offerings also has a new wrinkle. Increasingly, part of these deals is being distributed to European investors, a tangible sign that the long-awaited globalization of the markets is a reality. **********When Morgan Stanley went public earlier this year, about one-third of the nearly $300 million in stock was sold to overseas investors. And one million of the five million shares that Citicorp recently sold went to the European market. **********The flood of such deals made the half rewarding, but taxing, for corporate finance departments on Wall Street. Anthony P. Grassi, head of corporate finance at the First Boston Corporation, said that although his department's staffing had been growing rapidly, it would probably have to expand by more than 20 percent in the next year to match the pace of business. ''We always try to run at a slightly understaffed level, but we've been very understaffed,'' Mr. Grassi said. **********There were, however, several major trouble spots in the markets during the half that singed some fingers on Wall Street. Prices on the bond market were extremely volatile, which left some firms holding on to losses when the securities they underwrote tumbled in value unexpectedly. **********For instance, officials of Salomon Brothers, Goldman, Sachs & Company and E.F. Hutton were among those who admitted to suffering losses in their bond trading departments. Also, the flow of underwritings slowed in the second quarter, suggesting that the second half may not be as brisk. **********''All the bond underwriting volume was really a mixed blessing,'' said Christopher Moore, head of capital markets at Bear, Stearns & Company. ''It was a very treacherous half.''

An increased share of that total was acounted for by equity, rather than debt securities, the firm's traditional strength. And First Boston stayed in second, with $19.8 billion, according to the Securities Data figures. **********But Drexel Burnham Lambert, which is slowly expanding beyond its stronghold in the low-grade, or ''junk,'' bonds realm, leaped from fifth in 1985 to third in the first half, with $17.3 billion in underwritings. It was followed by Morgan Stanley & Company, which scooted up from sixth to fourth. **********That reshuffled Goldman, Sachs & Company to fifth from the third spot, and Merrill Lynch & Company to sixth, from fourth in 1985, although both firms enjoyed big increases in their underwriting totals during the six months compared with the period a year earlier. **********And Prudential-Bache Securities jumped into the top 10 ranking, making the ninth spot on the back of its two huge initial public offerings - for its Australian securities fund and its just-issued new global fund. Together they made up about $1.3 billion of its total during the half of $2.268 billion in underwritings. **********Wall Street firms underwrote a total of $112.3 billion in debt securities during the half, according to the Securities Data Company, which was up from $105 billion issued in all of 1985.

Marcos Broadcast Interrupted **********President Marcos declared a state of emergency in a broadcast today that was interrupted when the television pictures suddenly went blank. Rebel troops had seized control of the Government television studios in Quezon City near here after a brief gunfight. **********The rebels began broadcasting after several hours in which the station was off the air. The rebels announced that what they called the era of using the station for Marcos propaganda was at an end. The one known fatality of the day occurred when a soldier was shot accidentally in the head during the confrontation over the station. **********The rebels at the station had troops in place to protect against a counterattack. Mr. Marcos may be able arrange access to one of the non-Government stations but there was no immediate sign that he was trying to. Declaration's Effect Unsure **********The fast-moving events left the ultimate outcome of the three-day standoff unclear. There was no indication as to what Mr. Marcos's declaration of a state of emergency would mean. **********After the dawn encounter at the military camp, in which several helicopter loads of pro-Marcos troops defected to the rebels, the dissidents claimed victory, but two hours later Mr. Marcos went on television from Malacanang Palace to denounce them at a news conference in the broadcast that was eventually interrupted. **********''I intend to stay as President and if necessary I will defend this position with all the force at my disposal,'' he said. Attacks Rebel Leaders **********''We are in control of the military,'' Mr. Marcos emphasized at the news conference, saying that he would treat Juan Ponce Enrile, the former Defense Minister, and Lieut. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, the former Deputy Chief of Staff, as ''rebels trying to establish a revolutionary government.'' **********The two men resigned from the Government Saturday night after hearing reports that they would be arrested on charges of plotting against Mr. Marcos. They took over military headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo and nearby Camp Crame and demanded that Mr. Marcos resign because of what they called fraud in his re-election. **********Mr. Marcos issued orders that force be used to defend all Government installations from takeovers. **********Rebels at Camp Crame told of having flown three quick helicopter gunship missions this morning. One pilot said that he had flown to the presidential palace and fired six rockets onto the palace grounds, ''to let them know we had the capability.'' Rebel helicopters also attacked helicopters on the ground at an air base in the Manila area, after warning Government troops to stand clear, and destroyed at least two. **********The rebel officers said that they had control of 12 helicopters including 6 gunships, 2 F-5 jet fighters and 6 T-28 trainers. In addition, they say they have control of five battalions, or about 3,000 men, with up to four more battalions reported heading for the camp to join them. **********The military men who gathered at Camp Crame were seen swearing allegiance to what some of them were calling a provisional government. Officials there had no immediate answer to the question of who might head such a government. Officers, for example, were being sworn in as members of the ''air force of the people.'' **********As the confusion and uncertainty continued, a call for a general strike was issued by Bayan, an umbrella organization of leftist political groups and unions, beginning immediately. **********A helicopter appeared this morning near the presidential palace and dropped a grenade, apparently with no damage or casualties. A tank quickly fired three rounds into the air at the helicopter, also with no effect. Soldiers Disperse Crowd **********At Mendiola Bridge near the palace, a crowd of roughly 2,000 people were confronted by soldiers who fired shots into the air and used water cannon to disperse them. **********At Camp Crame this morning, after the apparent failure of the Government attack, the situation was confused. Mr. Enrile and General Ramos opened the gates and let in thousands of celebrating Filipinos who believed Mr. Marcos had left the country. Suddenly, however, the civilians were brought silent at the sight of two jet fighter aircraft circling overhead, apparently at the direction of the President's commanders. **********During Mr. Marcos's news conference, Gen. Fabian C, Ver, the military chief of staff, appeared very agitated. He openly argued with President Marcos, urging him to attack the Camp Crame holdouts with fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships. Orders From President **********Mr. Marcos ordered him: ''Hold on. You disperse the crowd without shooting them.'' **********Mr. Marcos said he considered the military dissidents to be revolutionaries, and he urged all the people forming a human barricade at Camp Crame ''to get out of the line of fire.'' **********Within the palace, anxiety was clear. A news reporter was ordered to leave by an official who said, ''We cannot guarantee your safety.'' **********The focus of the resistance to President Marcos, Camp Crame, is a suburban military post, normally a calm place with green lawns and golf courses. Today, however, the post golf course is being tramped over by soldiers on alert. The three-story constabulary headquarters, normally a quiet retreat of bureaucracy, has been filled with soldiers loyal to General Ramos, their weapons at the ready. Nearby, news reporters and television camera crews have thronged the area throughout the two-day confrontation. Beyond the building, crowds of civilians gathered in sympathy with General Ramos. **********The assault this morning began at Camp Crame when pro-Marcos riot troops, armed with riot sticks and tear-gas cannisters, tried to disperse the crowd of civilian supporters of the dissidents who had gathered outside the military camp. Helicopters Land in Camp **********Moments later, seven helicopters landed inside the gates. The thousands of soldiers and civilian backers of Mr. Enrile and General Ramos, at first thought they were part of the assault team. **********But the pilots and the crew members emerged waving white handkerchiefs indicating that they were sympathizers of the dissidents. Their appearance prompted cheers from the leaders of the resistance. **********Within hours additional reinforcements were arriving by helicopter. **********General Ramos shouted to a cheering crowd: ''The revolution was successfully accomplished!'' **********As he spoke, formerly pro-Marcos troops could be seen climbing the camp's walls to defect to his side while others were pulling back from the earlier confrontation. **********This anxious nation, exhausted from its extended electoral struggle, remained rife with rumors. Citizens listened to radio broadcasts, searching for certain word that the long stalemate was over. **********Scores of thousands celebrated outside the camp, kissing, hugging and shouting for Corazon C. Aquino, the opposition political leader who accused Mr. Marcos of stealing the presidency from her in the election Feb. 7. **********Reports flooded in of fresh military defections from Mr. Marcos's camp. **********There were unconfirmed reports that members of his security guard at the presidential palace were seen marching, waving white handkerchiefs and celebrating. The military dissidents have said soldiers wishing to surrender or join the revolt should wear white armbands. **********Mrs. Aquino, at the height of the overnight confrontation, pleaded over the radio that the Marcos troops desist from an assault on citizens and the garrisons where the dissident military officials were entrenched. **********''I appeal to the soldiers, please do not use force on innocent people,'' Mrs. Aquino declared. Aquino Went 'Underground' **********Little more than a day ago she had been staying ''underground,'' as her aides described it, as the resistance movement to Mr. Marcos was proclaimed by General Ramos and Mr. Enrile. She traveled Sunday to Manila from the city of Cebu, where she had been continuing her protest over the election results. **********While the dramatic arrival of the air force reinforcements at Camp Crame this morning provided a climactic moment this morning, celebrants in the crowd said the true turning point might well have occurred Sunday, in an earlier face-to-face confrontation between Marcos troops and anti-Marcos civilians. **********Tens of thousands of people had filled the street and successfully halted a column of armored vehicles that were headed toward the headquarters of the resistance. Direct appeals from members of the crowd to the soldiers caused them to retreat and bolstered the morale of the resistance movement. **********General Ramos, leader of the hard-pressed anti-Marcos faction in the military, reflected the rapid shifting of emotions in the long night. 'Bloody Horror and Terror' **********As the Marcos troops closed in, the general pleaded over the radio that Mr. Marcos avoid launching a wave of ''violence, bloody horror and terror.'' **********He obviously thought his small group of men was in imminent danger of annihilation. **********In rapid order, however, the general discovered that key parts of the Marcos military were declining to follow their orders and were, in fact, coming to his side. ''I think we have delivered the country from tyranny,'' General Ramos was declaring exultantly soon after dawn broke. 'An Old War Horse' **********In an angry 15-minute monologue of denunciations by Mr. Marcos of his opponents on television Sunday night, the President had said: **********''If they think I am sick, I may even want to lead the troops to wipe out this Enrile and Ramos. I am just like an old war horse, smelling powder and getting stronger.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/22/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 39, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** Ralph D.

Many contended that the sharp November jump in the index of leading indicators overstated the economy's strength, partly because the new tax law that takes effect this week has been spurring demand recently. **********These analysts also cited another report today that sales of new homes fell in November for the seventh time in the last eight months, and many blamed soaring prices.  [ Page D3. ]  One of the relative optimists was Donald Ratajczak, a forecasting specialist at Georgia State University. ''It's a fairly strong report,'' he asserted. ''Take the quirks out and you've still got something there.'' **********But others saw little indication in the data of a pickup from the sluggish pace of expansion. ''We're skeptical about any near-term acceleration in economic growth,'' said Robert L. Marks, president of Siff, Oakley & Marks Inc., a New York consultant. Mr. Marks noted that three months of sizable advances in the index between February and April 1986 did not point to a more vigorous economy. So far this year the economy has grown at a lackluster pace of 2.4 percent despite tumbling oil prices and a general decline in interest rates. **********Eight of the 11 available components of the leading index contributed to the November gain while three declined, the Commerce Department said. Once again, however, the biggest gains were financial components, not business ones, and this further tempered enthusiasm. **********Meanwhile, a private forecasting index compiled by Safian Investment Research climbed 1.42 percent last month after a 0.96 percent advance in October and a slight decline in September. **********This tabulation, which has 21 components, showed particular strength in its gauges of the labor market. This result was seemingly at odds with large job cutbacks announced by some major corporations, but Kenneth Safian suggested that what he called the ''downsizing'' of American industry was perhaps being accomplished generally by companies making modest additions to employment to increase production rather than investing heavily in new equipment. **********The Commerce Department also reported that its index of coincident indicators, which roughly tracks the current economy, rose four-tenths of 1 percent in November while its index of lagging indicators fell two-tenths of 1 percent. A flat or declining lagging index suggests a lack of forces that might curb future expansion. **********Without an extraordinary rise in prices of sensitive materials, the gain in the leading index would have been just seven-tenths of 1 percent instead of the 1.2 percent that was reported, said Gary E. Schlossberg, senior economist at the Wells Fargo Bank. He said the report ''confirms that the economy has been picking up'' over the past few months but he added that he remained skeptical that there will be much additional improvement in 1987."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/21/business/key-rates-627986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/11/business/court-curbs-toxic-waste-tax.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 564, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COURT CURBS TOXIC WASTE TAX", "print_headline": "COURT CURBS TOXIC WASTE TAX", "body_text": " **********The Supreme Court ruled today that some of the special taxes New Jersey has collected from oil and chemical companies for toxic waste cleanups were pre-empted by the Federal Superfund law and must be refunded. **********The decision could also block use of such taxes to create special funds for toxic waste cleanups not only in New Jersey but in New York, California and other states, environmentalists concerned about its potential impact said today. **********But while the decision spread concern among environmentalists and state officials, its import is unclear even for New Jersey, the state most directly affected. This is because the Court did not specify whether the pre-emptive effect of the Federal Superfund law continued after key provisions of that measure expired in September and because of disputes about how much money today's decision requires New Jersey to refund. **********New Legislation Weighed **********Congress is now considering new legislation to continue the Federal toxic waste cleanup tax and program. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, and others said they would try to make sure that any new Federal law did not pre-empt the ability of the states to have their own cleanup programs and taxes. **********New Jersey collected about $50 million in special taxes from oil and chemical companies in the five years the Federal Superfund law was clearly in effect, Mary C. Jacobson, a New Jersey Deputy Attorney General, said today. But she added that the state would not necessarily concede that any of the money had been spent for purposes barred by today's decision, and that it might argue in further proceedings that the pre-emptive effect of the Federal law expired last September and had no effect on taxes collected since then. **********The Court ruled, by 7 to 1, that the New Jersey ''Spill Fund'' tax, passed in 1977, was pre-empted in part by the 1980 Federal Superfund law, more formally known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Justice John Paul Stevens dissented in the case, Exxon Corp. v. Hunt, No. 84-978. Taxes Imposed by Both **********Both state and Federal laws imposed special taxes on oil and chemical companies to create funds to deal with toxic waste problems, and both said the money could be spent to finance governmental cleanups of waste sites and to reimburse others for cleanup costs. **********The New Jersey law also specified that the Spill Fund could be used for other purposes not covered by the Federal law, including compensating third parties for toxic waste damage, to administer the fund, to conduct research and to clean up oil spills. **********The Supreme Court, interpreting what it described as an ambiguous and poorly drafted pre-emption provision in the Federal law, said it barred states from using special taxes on oil and chemical companies to finance cleanups that might be eligible for Federal money, except for the 10 percent share of cleanup costs that the Federal law required states to contribute to any Federal cleanup. **********The state and the five companies that brought the suit, including the Exxon Corporation, the Union Carbide Corporation and the Monsanto Company, have long disputed how much of the Spill Fund money has been spent in ways prohibited by today's ruling and how much has gone to pay for things permitted by it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/22/business/reduced-tax-value-on-vacation-homes.html": {"writer_name": "Kelly Conlin", "pub_date": "1986-08-22", "snippet": "Vacation homes bought more for their value as tax shelters than as tranquil escapes would be less attractive investments under the proposed tax legislation.\n\nThat is because many owners who managed to cut their taxes by deducting losses associated...", "word_count": 871, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REDUCED TAX VALUE ON VACATION HOMES", "print_headline": "REDUCED TAX VALUE ON VACATION HOMES", "body_text": " **********Vacation homes bought more for their value as tax shelters than as tranquil escapes would be less attractive investments under the proposed tax legislation. **********That is because many owners who managed to cut their taxes by deducting losses associated with renting out a vacation home would find those deductions gradually phased out. **********As the law now stands, if owners use their vacation homes no more than two weeks a year, they can deduct rental expenses even if they exceed rental income. The proposed law would phase out this benefit and end it altogether for anyone making over $150,000. **********Property owners who visit their homes more than two weeks a year are now allowed to deduct rental expenses up to the amount of rental income. Although this benefit would continue, owning a second home will nevertheless become more expensive in general because a reduced personal tax rate would mean that deductions from mortgage interest and property taxes - which would still be allowed - would have less impact. **********The proposed law also decreases the amount of depreciation that could be deducted each year by lengthening the depreciation schedule to 27 1/2 years, from 19.Far-Reaching Impact **********The impact of the proposed bill is expected to be far-reaching. Vacation area development will come to a virtual halt, people in the real-estate industry say. Many vacation homes would be put on the market before year-end so the owners can pay the current, lower, capital gains taxes on their profits. And, the experts say, renters would find fewer homes to choose from when they go on vacation. **********''This will have a major negative impact on our business,'' said William (Sonny) DuBose, a real estate agent from Hilton Head Island, the resort community off the coast of South Carolina. ''It's pretty much eliminated the market from the standpoint of the investor,'' he said. **********Investors were drawn to projects in areas such as Hilton Head because their rental expenses, such as depreciation, utilities and maintenance, were substantially greater than the rental income. That meant they could deduct the loss from their tax bill. Now that such deductions would be curtailed or eliminated, many investors will try to sell such properties, experts predict. **********Mr. DuBose said that a large number of investors had already put their homes on the market and that prices had declined between 10 and 25 percent in the last year. **********Real estate experts said that the areas hit hardest by this tax reform would be the coastal resort communities. George Linville, president of the Florida Association of Realtors, predicted that passage of the tax bill would bring 10 percent more coastal property to market than would otherwise be the case. **********Those who rent vacation homes would find fewer units available, according to experts. Investors who keep their units would probably use them more, since they would no longer be limited to using the units less than 14 days to take full advantage of the tax law. **********''They would forgo the rental income, but they would also forgo the wear and tear from renting it,'' said Donald Massoglia, a partner at Peat Marwick, Mitchell & Co.'Double-Edged Sword' **********One industry expert, Thomas Franks of the American Resort and Residential Development Association, looks at the proposed changes as a ''double-edged sword.'' He said that while the decrease in investment activity would shrink the supply of rental units, the lower tax rate would make more discretionary income available for such purchases. **********''At least with a vacation home, you still get to write off the interest expense,'' Mr. Franks said. The bill maintains the deduction for mortgage interest and property taxes -usually the biggest deductions associated with a home - for first and second homes only. The bill defines a second home as one that is used for personal purposes at least 14 days or 10 percent of the number of days it is rented. **********''We think the second-home business will benefit in the long run,'' said William Turchyn, a senior vice president at E. F. Hutton. ''There are very few favored investments under the new tax bill,'' he said. ''In comparison to everything else, a second home will be very attractive.''Time Sharing May Grow **********Since outright ownership is more expensive under the new bill, however, industry experts predict that time-sharing arrangements, where ownership is shared among several families, would become more popular under the bill. **********The uncertainty over the tax bill has already started to affect the vacation home market. ''We're starting to see buyers shift from investors to families who don't worry as much about rentals or tax advantages,'' said Allan Andreason, a real estate agent on Amelia Island, a resort area off the coast from Jacksonville, Fla. **********The proposed legislation would take effect gradually, so homeowners would still be able to write off 65 percent of losses from rental activities in 1987.

Scallen, the president of International Broadcasting, a little-known diversified media company based in Minneapolis. **********The sale marks the end of Metromedia's 23-year ownership of the Ice Capades and its 10-year ownership of the Globetrotters, who since 1927 have demonstrated their flamboyant skills in tours throughout the United States and to 101 countries, including an exhibition in 1952 at Castel Gandolfo, Italy, before Pope Pius XII. A Sale of Assets **********Metromedia has been selling off assets. It recently sold its seven independent television stations to Rupert Murdoch, the Australian media entrepreneur, for about $2 billion. **********John W. Kluge, the principal owner and chairman of Metromedia Inc., bought the Ice Capades in 1963 for $5 million and the Globetrotters in 1976 for $11 million. **********Sources familiar with both operations said that revenue growth could be about 10 percent annually. **********Although the Globetrotters were pioneers in popularizing professional basketball and in providing careers for blacks in professional sports long before major league baseball and football did, their success at the box office had declined in recent years. In the last several years the team cut back to one squad from two. **********Partly to bolster attendance, the Globetrotters last year added their first woman player, Lynette Woodard, co-captain of the 1984 Olympics gold medal team and a former star at the University of Kansas. Attendance at Globetrotters' games has jumped this year. **********The Globetrotters were founded by Abe Saperstein, a promoter who organized sports teams. In their early days, they played competitively against the best basketball teams available, and they continued to hold their own in matches with National Basketball Association teams and college all-star teams into the 1950's. Humor on Court **********They also began, in the 1940's, to add to their game a wide variety of trick shots, hoaxes, jokes and patter, including the fancy-passing warm-up drill to the tune of ''Sweet Georgia Brown'' that has become their trademark. **********By the mid-1950's, when black players such as Bill Russell became dominant forces in the National Basketball Association, the Globetrotters began to have difficulty in attracting and holding on to the best players, and they began to play only exhibition games. Most frequently, they play a handpicked opponent, the Washington Generals, who last beat them in 1971. **********The Ice Capades, founded in Pittsburgh in 1942, plays in 102 cities in North America. Attendance was flat last year, with five million tickets sold, Mr. Scallen said, although it has risen this year. Mr. Scallen said he was not sure why. **********His purchase of the Globetrotters and the Ice Capades, Mr. Scallen said, was prompted in part by his interest in what he called ''production shows.'' Mr. Scallen previously ran the Shipstads & Johnson Ice Follies, Holiday on Ice and the Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus, the largest tent circus in the world. He also produced shows at Radio City Music Hall. **********The acquisitions should improve International Broadcasting's cash flow, Mr. Scallen said. Last year, International Broadcasting had revenues of $5 million and a loss of $800,000. The company also owns a television station in Abilene, Tex., that is a CBS affiliate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/13/world/shcharansky-is-assailed-for-meeting-palestinians.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 681, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHCHARANSKY IS ASSAILED FOR MEETING PALESTINIANS", "print_headline": "SHCHARANSKY IS ASSAILED FOR MEETING PALESTINIANS", "body_text": " **********Anatoly Shcharansky came under attack by a right-wing Member of Parliament today after the rights advocate met with two Palestinians. **********The Palestinians were seeking Mr. Shcharansky's help in preventing the expulsion of a prominent West Bank Palestinian journalist. **********The legislator, Rabbi Haim Druckman, a member of the nationalist Morasha Party, urged Mr. Shcharansky to ''apologize'' to the Israeli people and ''admit his mistake'' for meeting with the Palestinians, who are supposedly sympathetic to Yasir Arafat. **********Later today Mr. Shcharansky, who has tried to avoid getting embroiled in factional politics since coming here after being freed by the Soviet Union, issued what amounted to an apology. **********In a statement, he denounced the Palestine Liberation Organization, supported the Israeli action and said he was not aware of the backgrounds of those whom he had met. **********Last week the Israeli military authorities ordered the expulsion of Akram Haniye, editor of the pro-P.L.O. Arabic newspaper A-Shaab, published in Jerusalem. The authorities charged Mr. Haniye with being a coordinator for Al Fatah's political activities in the West Bank and with organizing strikes, writing leaflets and distributing money for the Arafat faction. **********But in explaining the expulsion, the Israeli authorities conceded that Mr. Haniye had not engaged in terrorism or political violence. Mr. Haniye has appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court to cancel the expulsion, and on Tuesday the court gave the Israeli Army 14 days to prove why Mr. Haniye should be expelled. In the meantime, the expulsion was postponed. **********Many Palestinian journalists fear that if the court rules that Mr. Haniye's expulsion is justified, it could serve as a precedent whereby more Palestinians could be expelled for political, as opposed to ''terrorist,'' activities. **********On Monday, Faisal Husseini of the pro-P.L.O. Arab Studies Center in Jerusalem and another Palestinian journalist met with Mr. Shcharansky for 30 minutes at his home, hoping to persuade him to come out publicly against Mr. Haniye's expulsion. **********Mr. Shcharansky reportedly told the Palestinian delegation that he was opposed to terror, but was surprised to learn of emergency regulations and restrictions on the residents of the West Bank and planned to find out more about them. **********Rabbi Druckman went on the Israel radio and described Mr. Shcharansky's meeting with the Palestinians as ''a great hurt for the state of Israel and the people of Israel.'' He added, ''I think it is only reasonable that he himself admit his mistake and apologize for it.'' **********Israel, Rabbi Druckman said, ''is waging a war and a bloody struggle against base murderers.'' He added: ''Anyone who gives them legitimacy is in fact giving a sword to our enemies. What is this? Do people get deported without reason in Israel?'' **********This afternoon Mr. Shcharansky issued a prepared statement, saying: **********''The people of Israel and the state of Israel are waging a war of self-defense against the P.L.O., a criminal terror organization whose goal is the denial of the legitimate right of the Jewish people to their homeland. The P.L.O. and those who support it have placed themselves beyond the pale of civilized society.'' **********''I learned, only after our meeting, that the delegation that met with me was identified with the P.L.O.,'' he continued. ''Had I known this fact in advance, the meeting would never have taken place. Just as Gorbachev is trying to use the institutions of the West to advance his own cause, so the P.L.O. are trying to use the democratic language and institutions of Israel in order to advance the cause of terror.'' **********Mr. Shcharansky concluded that he had the full confidence that the Government and security forces of Israel were ''waging an unrelenting battle for our protection against the scourge that calls itself the P.L.O.'' He added, ''The pursuit of this goal, in accordance with the laws of the state of Israel and subject to the judicial scrutiny of the Israeli Supreme court, is in no way a violation of human rights.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/11/business/wang-labs-critical-juncture.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Lueck", "pub_date": "1986-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1790, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WANG LABS' CRITICAL JUNCTURE", "print_headline": "WANG LABS' CRITICAL JUNCTURE", "body_text": " **********Frederick A. Wang bristled visibly at the inevitable request: to contrast his management style with that of his father, An Wang, the computer pioneer, philanthropist and founder of Wang Laboratories Inc. **********''I'm the product of a Yankee environment; he is not,'' said the junior Mr. Wang, 36 years old, who was named last month to succeed his Chinese-born father as president, giving him control over most of the company's operations. **********''Wang is rich with vision, and it is my job to implement,'' he added. ''We're going to hit solid singles rather than swing for home runs.'' A Critical Time **********For Wang, a maker of computers and word-processing equipment, the succession could not have come at a more critical time. The company, based here, has been battered by steep losses, product delays, layoffs and an exodus of top-level executives. **********Until 1985, when the entire computer industry fell into a slump, Wang had been one of its stars. With a string of highly successful calculators and word-processing systems developed by An Wang, the company became an almost ubiquitous presence in the American office, selling its goods to more than 80 percent of the nation's 2,000 largest companies. **********But now, as it realigns its management, Wang is also struggling to reignite growth by concentrating its efforts on minicomputers, the machines used to expand and tie together large computer networks. Facing Direct Competition **********Unlike the word-processing systems that fueled Wang's growth during the 1970's, minicomputers put the company in direct competition with I.B.M., the Digital Equipment Corporation and other industry giants at a time that the industry is continuing to contract. So far, Wang has captured only a 3 percent share of the market, according to the International Data Corporation, a Framingham, Mass., research firm. **********An Wang, 66, remains the company's chairman and chief executive. In an interview, he said he did not plan to give up those jobs soon. **********''My role is strategic,'' said the elder Wang, a precise, scholarly man who is known thoughout the company's 12-story office and research complex here as ''the doctor'' in recognition of his Harvard Ph.D. in applied physics. He intends to involve himself in the company's day-to-day operations ''where trouble requires my attention.'' **********Still, Dr. Wang said the appointment of his son as president represents a broad shift in management authority and a continuing effort to groom him for the chairman's job. In his autobiography, ''Lessons,'' published this year, Dr. Wang said he intended to remain chairman long enough so that Frederick, who joined the company in 1972, could demonstrate sufficient skills to succeed him. **********''Fred will have responsibility for almost all operations,'' he said of his son's new position, adding that it is now ''the best time for him to learn the business'' because ''there are problems to resolve.'' Little Surprise in the Succession **********The succession held little surprise for present and former employees. ''If he can turn things around now, he will prove his mettle as a manager,'' said John Cunningham, chairman of Computer Consoles Inc., who resigned as Wang's president in July 1985. **********Frederick Wang has moved quickly. Within hours of his selection as president Nov. 19, he appointed Ian Diery, 37, to head the company's United States sales operation. Analysts believe Mr. Diery, an Australian marketing expert who had been in charge of Wang's foreign sales, will play a role almost as important as Mr. Wang's if the company's sagging fortunes are reversed. **********After a year and a half of erratic earnings, Wang has incurred severe losses in recent months. For its first quarter in the 1987 fiscal year, ended Sept. 30, the company reported a loss of $30 million, compared with net income of $7 million, or 5 cents a share, in the corresponding period last year. Revenues increased 8 percent, to $597.9 million. **********Analysts blame sluggish sales throughout the computer industry and in the minicomputer market in particular for Wang's downturn. Its problems have been aggravated by large losses at Intecom Inc., a Texas manufacturer of electronic switching systems that it acquired in September. **********Reacting to the downturn, Wang has made deep cuts in its work force. In July, it offered voluntary retirement incentives that have been accepted by 1,600 employees. That followed the elimination of another 1,600 jobs last year, its first layoffs in more than a decade. The cutbacks have left Wang with about 30,000 employees. Steep Slide for Stock **********The company's class B voting stock, which traded at more than $40 a share in 1983, has been in a steep downward slide.  [ It closed Wednesday on the American Stock Exchange at $13.25, unchanged. ]  Dr. Wang, Frederick and other members of the family, including Frederick's brother, Courtney, 29, a Wang vice president, control 39.6 million shares, or 28 percent, of all Wang stock, including nonvoting class C shares. **********Frederick Wang, who has a degree in mathematics from Brown University, said Wang's immediate objective is to be profitable this year. **********Mr. Wang, his face boyish under prematurely gray hair, added that his job is far different from the one his father had when Wang was still a relatively small, entrepreneurial concern. ''I've got to delegate more authority,'' he said. **********An Wang, raised near Shanghai, became a pioneer in computer research while still studying for his Ph.D. At the age of 28, he invented one version of the magnetic-core memory that was to be a central component in computer design for two decades. **********After founding Wang Laboratories in a South Boston loft in 1951, he developed a string of highly successful products. They included sophisticated desk calculators, which the company marketed to scientists and engineers during the 1960's, and Wang's word-processing systems, sold to thousands of companies during the 1970's. Earnings Soared **********Along the way, earnings soared. For two decades before the 1985 fiscal year, when Wang reached its peak net income of $210.2 million, its earnings increased by an average of 40 percent a year. **********After being hit by problems in 1985, including the departure of Mr. Cunningham and other key executives and waning demand for word-processing systems, Dr. Wang took upon himself a brutal work schedule as both chairman and president. With earnings in a tailspin, and with employee morale suffering, he traveled almost constantly to visit Wang plants and call on customers across the country. **********Dr. Wang denied speculation by some analysts that the rigors of the last year had prompted him to promote his son sooner than he otherwise might have. Instead, he said, the decision was made because Frederick, after 14 years in the company, was ready for more responsibility. **********One problem facing the junior Mr. Wang results from a series of delays that have plagued its top-of-the-line minicomputer, the VS-300. Introduced in 1983 as one of several new Wang computers, the machine had software problems that put off many potential customers. **********Computer industry experts say the problems have been corrected. But Wang's reputation for reliability has been damaged. ''Wang has a credibility problem on its hands,'' said Stephen Smith of Paine Webber. **********And the difficulties with the VS-300 have done little to enhance Frederick Wang's own image, since the computer was developed - and offered prematurely to customers - while he was in charge of Wang's research and development operations. **********In contrast to An Wang, who gained the devotion of hundreds of the company's engineers, Frederick Wang has been reputed to be impatient and sometimes overbearing. ''Fred tends to be a contentious manager,'' said Mr. Cunningham, the former Wang president. **********For his part, Frederick Wang acknowledged making mistakes, but added, ''There is a maturing process that takes place with most managers, and I am not an exception.'' **********Indeed, while he receives some criticism, Mr. Wang is also getting high marks on Wall Street for his selection of executives to head key departments. Among them is Horace Tsiang, a highly regarded engineer, who now heads research and development. **********''The conventional wisdom is that Fred Wang did a bad job in research and development, but he has also shown a knack for choosing the right people to get things done,'' said Daniel Chertoff of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. **********Wang said orders for the VS-300, although sluggish through most of the first quarter, picked up rapidly before the quarter ended Sept. 30, after several outside experts concluded that its software problems were resolved. **********Mr. Chertoff estimated that sales of Wang's largest minicomputers, including the VS-300, would rise rapidly from $38 million in the first quarter to more than $100 million during the fourth quarter, ending next June 30. **********One advantage for Wang is that its success in marketing word processers - far less expensive and sophisticated machines than the minicomputers - has made its brand name known at thousands of companies. **********Still, marketing minicomputers requires a different strategy. Instead of selling its products to department heads or line managers - as it has with word processers - Wang's sales personnel must now deal directly with Management Information Systems managers, the executives who control companywide computer planning and who tend to have experience dealing with computer companies larger than Wang. **********''In some ways, we are being hurt by past success,'' said Mr. Diery, the new vice president for United States sales. ''MIS managers still think of Wang as a word-processing company, and we've got to get the message across.'' **********To address that problem, Mr. Diery said he would reorganize Wang's 1,200-member domestic sales force. Those whose experience is principally in dealing with word-processing systems will be brought to Lowell for training in the far more complex minicomputer market. Several computer consultants will also be hired, he said. **********An Wang, looking fit, and immaculately dressed in a business suit and bow tie - something of a personal trademark - said he now planned few trips outside the Boston area, but would continue with the company ''indefinitely.'' **********Dr. Wang also said he planned to continue his wide-ranging philanthropic interests in the Boston area, where he has already contributed more than $20 million to Harvard and several cultural and medical institutions. In his autobiography, he said that he was planning to bequeath the bulk of his Wang stock to the Wang Institute, a center for computer research that he established near here in 1979. **********As for Wang Laboratories, he said: ''The current problems are temporary. Our long-term prospects are very good.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/31/world/mubarak-starts-talks-with-officials-in-bonn.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 209, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mubarak Starts Talks With Officials in Bonn", "print_headline": "Mubarak Starts Talks With Officials in Bonn", "body_text": " **********President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt held talks with West German officials today, starting a two-day visit that is expected to center on his attempt to involve the Western European powers in the Middle East peace process. **********Mr. Mubarak, who arrived from France, has proposed that the Western Europeans form a group to prepare a Middle East peace conference that would include Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********President Francois Mitterrand of France reacted coolly to the idea. **********The Egyptian leader held separate meetings today with President Richard von Weizsacker and with West German opposition leaders.

Two prominent senators who were deeply involved in the tax debate, Bill Bradley and John C. Danforth, disagreed on the likely economic consequences of the legislation, as did two former chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers, Murray L. Weidenbaum and Alan Greenspan. **********The bill, which will sharply reduce the tax rates of individuals and businesses and eliminate or limit many familiar deductions and other tax preferences, was given final Congressional approval Saturday afternoon by a Senate vote of 74 to 23.

Mr. Bradley said that by eliminating ''distortions in the economy, you will have a more efficient allocation of capital.'' As a result, he said, ''the economy would be healthy and leaner and, I believe, more competitive.'' Secretary Baker's Stand **********Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, who was interviewed on the same program, and Donald T. Regan, the President's chief of staff, who appeared on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' agreed with Senator Bradley's analysis. **********Mr. Weidenbaum, the President's chief economic adviser in 1981 and 1982 and now director of the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis, sided with Mr. Danforth. ''By reducing incentives for business expansion,'' he said, ''we're going to see fewer new jobs created, a weaker economy, less revenues into the Treasury, more unemployment compensation, a bigger budget deficit.'' **********Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that the measure might raise slightly less revenue than anticipated and that some short-run dislocations in the economy might occur, but he agreed with Senator Bradley that ''we're going to get less of the type of investment which is not all that productive.''

''They are about fairness, and this bill is fair.'' **********The bill will not be sent to the White House officially until senators decide what to do about a 70-page resolution accompanying the legislation that the House passed Thursday.

It could just as easily be found in Valley Stream, L.I., or Morristown, N.J. **********The home is a Japanese vision of American suburbia. With dormers, bay windows, french doors, white picket fence, wrought-iron lamp at the entrance and a statue of a cherub guarding the door, the house is thoroughly Western inside as well as outside. It was built with the platform-frame construction method, which, along with the lumber used, is imported from Canada and the United States. **********These Western-style homes are all the rage in Japan. The Nakamuras' home is what the Japanese call a two-by-four - the construction method uses lumber familiarly known as two-by-four's because of its pre-cut dimensions. In an industry in which overall growth is sluggish, two-by-four homes increased by nearly 25 percent in the fiscal year 1985, which ended on March 31 of this year. **********A Hit With Young Couples **********The total number of two-by-four homes, which began to appear in Japan a few years ago, is still small - nearly 26,000 out of 590,206 wooden homes built in the fiscal year 1985. But industry executives and analysts say their construction is likely to swell as young couples such as the Nakamuras increasingly shop for Western-style homes. **********''The Westernization of wooden homes accounts for the strong growth of two-by-fours,'' said Daniel Nielsen, an industry analyst for the British brokerage firm of W. I. Carr Overseas Ltd. ''The whole area of consumer taste is becoming more individualistic.'' **********When they started house-hunting, the Nakamuras knew they wanted a two-by-four home and the way of life that went with it. Takuo Nakamura, a 37-year-old vice president of a design and marketing company, his wife, Etsuko, and their three children had been living in a traditional Japanese home with his parents. **********The Nakamuras said they liked the two-by-four home's resistance to earthquakes and fire, as well as the insulation that blocks out noise and inclement weather far better than their old Japanese home. And they enjoy the comforts of living Western-style - with chairs rather than tatami straw mats, and with beds rather than the futon mattresses that Japanese have slept on for centuries. **********''We were living the tatami life style, and now we are living the chair life style, and I like it much better now,'' Mrs. Nakamura said. **********She is not alone. Half the households in Japan now own at least one bed, and more than a million beds were sold last year, according to the Japan Bed Manufacturers' Association. As more Japanese choose wooden floors or carpets, tatami makers are suffering - they sold about 20 million mats in 1984, down from 38 million in the peak year of 1973, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. **********Japanese have also shunned the traditional squat toilets. Toto Ltd., which dominates the market here, said more than 70 percent of its sales are for Western-style sit-down toilets. Two External Pressures **********For Kenzo Yamashita, who fought skeptics at his parent company to help bring two-by-four homes to Japan, these trends confirm what he always believed - that Japanese would be drawn to a home with Western architecture and Western construction methods. **********The two-by-four home came to Japan as a result of two external pressures: the after-effects of the 1973 oil shock, and the determined lobbying of the Canadian Government and lumber industry. **********With governments concerned about a shortage of natural resources, Mr. Yamashita said, both Canada and states in the American Northwest would not export whole logs, which Japanese manufacturers had been importing and then cutting to size as befitted their traditional post-and-beam construction method. Only pre-cut lumber was available. Home Fairs Set Up **********At the same time, the Canadian Government and lumber industry began vigorous promotions of the platform-frame construction method, setting up home fairs throughout Japan to extol its virtues, and training Japanese carpenters in the method. Lobbying by the Canadian Government also persuaded Japan's Construction Ministry to change regulations that had discouraged the growth of two-by-four housing. **********Canada's efforts paid off, and by far the majority of the lumber imported for two-by-four homes comes from Canada. More than three times as much of the lumber is imported from Canada as from the United States, according to Chuichi Kikawa of the Japan Two by Four Home Builders Association. **********He said that Canada remained more aggressive and more adaptable to Japanese demands. ''Canadians are better in adjusting products to fit Japanese tastes, because for them the export market is very important,'' Mr. Kikawa said. ''U.S. businesses tend to take the attitude that if the product is O.K. for the domestic market, it should be O.K. for Japan, too.'' 'Summit House' Built **********Lumber is one of the continuing trade disputes between Japan and the United States, and this year Washington and the American industry took a leaf from Canada's book and built what they called a ''Summit House,'' a two-by-four home with American carpenters, to show Japanese the quality of American lumber and worksmanship. **********The early Canadian promotional efforts drew the attention of Mr. Yamashita and fellow members of the Mitsui Real Estate Company, who were late entrants in the housing market and wanted to try something new. Mr. Yamashita said that executives at the company opposed the idea, thinking it would not catch on. **********Now Mr. Yamashita is the managing director of the Mitsui Home Company, the leading builder of two-by-four homes in Japan, with 25 percent of the market. The company, which earned $11 million on sales of $454 million in the fiscal year 1985, has recorded nine consecutive years of increases in sales and profits. **********''We are on top of the trend of the Westernization of Japanese living style,'' Mr. Yamashita said. 'Nooks' and 'Hobby Rooms' **********Mitsui Home's catalogues feature styles such as the ''Colonial,'' with dormer and bay windows and a Greek revival portico, and the ''Harvard,'' with brick veneer and a brick chimney jutting up from the roof. The catalogues boast of ''nooks'' for ''family communication'' and ''hobby rooms'' for what the company calls the ''playing stage'' of home life. The company uses a team of American and Japanese architects. **********About 40 percent of Mitsui Home's clients are couples in their 30's, Mr. Yamashita said, and many want more from their home than their parents. He said they wanted more room to entertain and to pursue the hobbies that their shorter working hours permit. Customers for these homes pay an average price of $226,000, which is slightly higher than that for a comparable Japanese home. **********Because of the high cost of real estate in Japan, The lots for these homes generally are not as large as those in the United States. **********But Mitsui Home has also had to make concessions to Japanese tastes. Since many customers still live with their parents, Mitsui provides tatami rooms for older Japanese. **********The company's early models included thick wall-to-wall carpeting, but in Japan's humid weather, it grew sodden, and the thick piles proved a breeding ground for insects. Now the company supplies wooden floors. **********And Mitsui invariably designs a genkan, or recessed entrance hall, for people to leave their shoes before stepping inside. That is one custom, Mr. Yamashita said, that will surely resist Westernization."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/12/world/around-the-world-us-and-poland-hold-talks-in-vienna.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. and Poland Hold Talks in Vienna", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; U.S. and Poland Hold Talks in Vienna", "body_text": " **********The United States and Poland have resumed high-level contacts in a sign of a possible thaw in relations that were frozen after the crackdown on Solidarity and the imposition of martial law five years ago. **********Rozanne L.

But his accountant cautioned him that what seemed like a bargain could increase his taxes -because the difference between fair market value and incentive option prices is one of the tax preference items of the alternative minimum tax. **********After discussion with the accountant, the executive decided instead to exercise some nonqualified stock options that he held. That way, he would be creating ordinary income, which would raise his adjusted gross income and not trigger the A.M.T., as it is known. **********The alternative minimum tax was intended by Congress to insure that every individual with significant income pays at least some tax. It may seem a remote matter to many taxpayers, but to millions of self-employed, professionals, executives and affluent, particularly those with significant incentive stock options or investments in tax shelters, the A.M.T. is an increasingly familiar and unhappy presence. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that as many as 3 percent of all taxpayers might be paying the A.M.T. on their 1985 returns, according to a spokesman, Steven Pyrek. **********The A.M.T. is a flat tax that starts with a taxpayer's adjusted gross income and adds back to it a number of tax breaks, known as ''tax preference'' items. Certain deductions and an exemption are permitted, and the taxpayer must then pay 20 percent of the balance, or the income tax due by conventional calculations -whichever is greater. **********Under the tax bill passed by the House, the miminum tax would increase to 25 percent from the present 20 percent and and more tax preference items would be added. **********The minimum tax has been around in various forms for some years. But it had few teeth until Congress stiffened it in the 1970's, then tightened it further in 1981. **********''The intent of Congress has always been that every individual who has significant income will pay at least a minimum tax,'' remarked Jerry P. Leamon, national director, executive financial services, for Deloitte Haskins & Sells, who is based in San Francisco. ''And the way to do it was to add to the income such preference items as capital gains and other devices.'' **********Among the seven categories of preferences added back under current law is the normal 60 percent exclusion for long-term capital gains. A taxpayer receiving capital gains might review his investment portfolio to search out possible capital losses and take them, if his realized gains are substantial enough to subject him to the A.M.T. **********Warren M. Bergstein, senior manager at Ernst & Whinney, the accounting firm in New York, suggested that a seller of a substantial property find a buyer willing to take it on an installment plan, with payments made over several years. Accepting payment over several years, Mr. Bergstein said, ''might eliminate or lighten the tax load under A.M.T.'' **********Another preference item is the excess of accelerated depreciation over straight-line depreciation on real property. **********Other preferences are the value of incentive stock options, and a variety of complex technical items that pertain mainly to those who use tax shelters that invest in mining and oil development. **********On the other side of the ledger, before being subject to the A.M.T. taxpayers can reduce their income with a $30,000 personal exemption ($40,000 on joint returns) and six itemized deductions. **********These include medical expenses in excess of 10 percent of the adjusted gross income, rather than the 5 percent used on Schedule A; home mortgage interest; other interest paid, but only up to the amount of net investment income; charitable contributions; casualty losses in excess of 10 percent of the adjusted gross income, and certain estate taxes. **********The remaining figure is the taxable income, which is then taxed at 20 percent, and only one tax credit - for foreign taxes paid - can be applied against the bottom line. **********What can be done to minimize the A.M.T.'s impact? **********Accelerate income, including short-term capital gains, so that it will be taxed at 20 percent instead of at a 50 percent marginal rate, and defer deductions, so that they can offset income that may be taxed at the top bracket next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/03/business/micron-drops-chip-suit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Micron Drops Chip Suit", "print_headline": "Micron Drops Chip Suit", "body_text": " **********Micron Technology Inc., a semiconductor maker based in Boise, Idaho, has dropped its antitrust complaint against six major Japanese chip makers and their subsidiaries in the United States.

Finally, as the night wore on, one longtime diplomat grumbled under his breath, ''I just hope that the Messiah isn't an American.'' If he is, Israelis feel, they could be in for a long wait. **********Israeli officials say the American ''hysteria'' about traveling abroad has dealt a severe blow to their country's $1.5 billion tourist industry and handed Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya a victory the likes of which he probably never dreamed. **********Since the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro in September, Israeli tourism officials estimate that their country has lost at least $300 million in tourist revenue. This was largely a result of a decline of more than 40 percent in visitors from the United States in the first four months of this year - from 93,300 in 1985 to 54,900 in 1986. It is the largest percentage decline in Israeli tourism outside a wartime period. Hotel Dismissals Seen **********Israeli hotels, tour operators, restaurants and souvenir shops have all been squeezed. If the situation does not improve soon, Israeli tourism officials say, as many as one-third of the 23,000 hotel employees may have to be dismissed. **********''There is something going on in America which I just don't recognize,'' Israel's Minister of Tourism, Avraham Sharir, said in an interview. ''We are facing an unprecedented hysteria that is sweeping the land. Americans were always known for bravery. They fought two world wars to defend freedom, and now some of them are showing such cowardice by not traveling abroad. **********''I heard that Sylvester Stallone would not even go to the Cannes film festival,'' Mr. Sharir said. ''How could that be? Rambo himself?'' **********The signs abound. A few weeks ago Trans World Airlines announced an hour before takeoff that its flight from the Tel Aviv airport to Paris would make an unscheduled stop in Athens to pick up a tour group. A small riot almost broke out among some passengers, and 50 of them refused to board the flight if it went through the Athens airport. T.W.A. had to make arrangements for the 50 to travel on other carriers. Not Waiting for Surgery **********Dr. Leon Gross, an eye surgeon from Atlanta, who visited Israel in early May, told this story: **********''Before I left, I was making arrangements with a woman patient who was going to have cataract surgery when I returned. While we were scheduling her surgery, she asked me where I was going on vacation. I told her, 'Israel.' As soon as she heard that, she demanded I perform the surgery before I left. **********''I told her, 'Thanks for the vote of confidence in me, but no thanks for the vote of confidence in my coming back,' '' Dr. Gross said. ''I got so many calls from other patients urging me not to go that I finally had to tell my receptionist to inform anyone who calls that I was going to Hawaii.'' **********In another sign of the times, Tourism Minister Sharir recently came up with an interesting new statistic: More tourists from West Germany have visited Israel so far this year than have American Jews. **********In fact, Israel's tourism situation would be far worse if it were not for a small increase in tourists from Europe. The most crowded tourist center in Israel today is the Red Sea port of Eilat, which deals almost exclusively with package tours from Europe. El Al Israel Airlines reports an increase of 2 to 4 percent in traffic from Europe in recent months, in contrast with a roughly 10 percent decline from the United States. Europeans Less Intimidated **********The same Europeans who, except for the British, refused to cooperate in the American air strike against Libya have been much less intimidated about traveling abroad after that attack, since, Israeli tourism officials say, they have lived with terrorism in their own countries for many years. Meanwhile, the Americans are in many cases afraid to leave the confines of the United States. **********What makes the situation doubly annoying for Israelis is the fact that through all the years in which Israel has been a target, the terrorists and guerrillas have never managed to alter Israelis' ways of life. **********''They put bombs on buses, but people never stopped riding buses,'' said Shlomo Gazit, a former chief of military intelligence. ''They put bombs in supermarkets, but no one stopped shopping. They hijacked planes, but no one stopped traveling. **********''But now, you Americans are handing Qaddafi a victory he never could have imagined,'' Mr. Gazit said. ''It is as though you have been fighting terrorism with aspirin and suddenly decided to inflict a heart attack on yourselves. Instead of encouraging Americans to stay home, President Reagan should be urging them to go abroad.'' Israel Opening Campaign **********In the absence of such urgings, Israel is opening a campaign to convince Americans that Israel is basically a safe place to visit. **********The Ministry of Tourism is bringing to Israel 250 American pastors, whose churches have more that 1,000 members, to show them how secure Israel is and to try to induce them to return with congregational tours. Sixty percent of Israel's tourists are non-Jews. About three months ago, the Israeli tourist authorities did the same with 200 rabbis, and today 102 of them are now organizing tours, according to Moshe Shoshani, the Ministry of Tourism's director for North America. **********Also, El Al is adding two to three more nonstop flights a week from New York to Tel Aviv to cater to American tourists who are afraid to travel through Europe. El Al has also decided to take commerical advantage of its excellent record for security by adding to its current advertising slogan - ''El Al the airline of Israel'' - the words, ''the airline people believe in.'' **********The Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel has pitched in by sending 100,000 bumper stickers to Jewish groups across American that read: ''Don't Let Qaddafi Win - Visit Israel Now.'' #50% Cancel U.J.A. Trips Naftali Lavi, the director of the United Jewish Appeal's office in Israel, which is responsible for bringing thousands of American Jewish tourists on philanthropic visits, found that 50 percent of those scheduled to come on U.J.A. missions this spring had canceled. He decided that if the tourists would not come to him, he would go get them. **********''We have many good guides who are now unemployed,'' Mr. Lavi said. ''I just sent four of them to the United States to meet with Jewish community leaders and potential visitors to talk about Israel, and how peaceful life here really is.'' **********More important, Mr. Lavi armed his tour guides with a battery of bizarre statistics. These include the fact that in 1984, 18,700 Americans were murder victims, or roughly 8 per 100,000. In Israel, only 21 people were killed in guerrilla or terrorist-related attacks in 1985. In addition, only 70 murders were committed in Israel in this period, making a total of 0.02 casualties per 100,000. **********''We want people to know that in percentage terms they are actually safer coming to Israel than staying at home,'' Mr. Lavi said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/23/business/economic-scene-global-appeal-of-capitalism.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1986-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 847, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Global Appeal Of Capitalism", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Global Appeal Of Capitalism", "body_text": " **********THE most remarkable development in the century-long struggle between capitalism and socialism is the growing recognition among many socialist leaders that capitalism delivers the goods of economic development.

But that was not true here of the Japanese, who are playing an increasingly outspoken role in the Trilateral Commission.

''Actually,'' he said, ''the reason for my early arrival is that I was leading a group of Japanese businessmen who are excited about investment opportunities in Spain and Portugal following their entry into the European Community.'' Japan, he said, sees Spain as a new avenue of contact with European trading partners. **********The Trilateralists also held out hope of greater investments in Africa and the third world. They invited as one of the key speakers Babacar N'Diaye, chairman of the African Development Bank. Mr. N'Diaye said the African countries had some control over their macroeconomic policies, which they can manipulate with the view to promoting economic growth. But, he added, as regards other factors such as exchange rates, trade and external debt, African economies are much influenced by economic developments in the Trilateral countries. **********He urged the Trilateralists to help alleviate the third-world debt crisis through increased direct foreign investment, provision of fast-disbursing loans, increased commercial bank lending and assistance through the institutions of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. **********Richard N. Gardner, a law professor at Columbia University and former American Ambassador to Italy, suggested a new device for helping the developing countries: establishing funds in the Trilateral countries to invest in a diversified portfolio of shares in profitable third-world companies. He saw opportunities that might go well beyond what governments could do, since pension funds, insurance companies, investment companies and mutual funds in the industrial democracies manage a pool of capital of more than $2 trillion - a pool that is growing 15 percent a year. Just 1 percent of the annual growth in those assets would provide an annual capital flow of $3 billion. **********The creation of new capital funds, Mr. Gardner added, could also be a way to help repatriate some of the capital removed from those countries by their own citizens, which amounts to well over $100 billion, according to Federal Reserve estimates. **********To be sure, stock market investments in third-world countries represent a high-risk option, but the rewards could be commensurate. **********By one calculation, Mr. Gardner said, a weighted stock index of nine developing countries more than doubled the rate of return of a similar index for industrial countries. India's stock market, for instance, showed more than a threefold increase. **********And the risks of investment in third-world countries could be reduced through international insurance and diversification devices. The International Finance Corporation, the private-enterprise arm of the World Bank, is putting growing stress on stimulating portfolio investment in developing countries. For openers, it is asking private investors in the industrial world to put up $50 million in a new Emerging Markets Growth Fund to put money into a diversified portfolio of stocks in Brazil, Mexico, Thailand and Malaysia. **********Lenin may have been right about global imperialism being the final stage of capitalism. But he did not anticipate that, by the final years of the 20th century, the socialists would be inviting the capitalists in. Mr. Rockefeller, now retired as chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank and just back from a meeting at Baku in the Soviet Union between American and Soviet businessmen, said here that even the Russians are seriously interested in discussing joint ventures with Western companies. **********As far as the Trilateralists are concerned, Kipling's dictum that ''East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet'' is obsolete."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/11/business/japan-easing-entry-of-us-drug-items.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1986-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 664, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPAN EASING ENTRY OF U.S. DRUG ITEMS", "print_headline": "JAPAN EASING ENTRY OF U.S. DRUG ITEMS", "body_text": " **********Japan will accept foreign clinical test data in approving the sale of pharmaceuticals and will ease the transfer of manufacturing licenses within Japan under agreements announced today to widen access of American companies to the Japanese market. **********The agreements were described in a 39-page report, published by the two Governments, on the market-oriented, sector-selective talks on medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. **********These talks are part of a process in which the United States and Japan have pinpointed industrial sectors where the Japanese maintain regulatory, tariff and other barriers to imports.

In the past, if an American company tried to change a joint venture in Japan to a 100 percent owned subsidiary there, it had trouble getting the necessary license transferred from the old entity to the new one. **********Virtually all Japanese citizens are reimbursed for the cost of medical products under health insurance, so a product cannot sell in Japan unless it is on the official reimbursement list.

''We are moving to produce a public report.'' **********Political Motive Denied **********A senior White House official denied that Mr. Reagan's request was intended to allow him to claim credit for disclosing the findings. The official said it was a procedural move by the President because only the executive branch could declassify materials. **********Mr. Reagan contends that he is doing everything possible to make public the truth about the secret operations in which weapons were sold to Iran and some of the proceeds diverted to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras. **********But members of the Senate committee and its counterpart in the House, which conducted a similar inquiry, have repeatedly charged that the Administration was not fully cooperating with the investigation.

Rodino Jr., Democrat of New Jersey and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d today for not providing the House panel with answers to written questions about the Iran affair. **********By releasing the report on its own, the committee could say that it was Congressional oversight, and not the President, that was responsible for informing the public about what the panel's three weeks of hearings have discovered. Appeal to Poindexter and North **********The committee had rejected Mr. Reagan's request last Tuesday that it grant limited immunity to two former White House officials as a way of getting them to tell what they knew. The two, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, had invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in appearances before the panel. **********Mr. Reagan, speaking at a White House conference on small businesses, said today that until Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North told what they knew, a complete understanding of what had taken place would not be possible. **********''Until Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North make public disclosures of the facts, the American people will not know the full story of what happened in the Iran arms sales matter or the alleged diversion of funds to the contras,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''However, that doesn't mean that substantial portions of the facts, as gathered thus far, cannot be made known.'' **********''As the committee prepares a report on its findings and conclusions, I urge them to make that report available to me for declassification as promptly as possible,'' he said. ''To be sure, that report will not have all the answers, but it will be the most complete statement available, and I call on the committee to release it so the American people can judge for themselves.'' Request Called 'Twisted' **********The Senate committee's ranking Democrat, Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, indicated that the panel would reject the request. **********''The President ordered this whole operation on Iran,'' he said. ''He ordered his Administration not to tell the intelligence committees what he was doing. Now he wants the intelligence committee to tell him what his Administration was doing during the time they were under his orders not to tell the intelligence committee.'' **********''Even Alice in Wonderland doesn't get this twisted around,'' Mr. Leahy said. **********But Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, said Mr. Reagan was right in urging the committee to make transcripts public once they are declassified. He said this would be another step toward making sure the public and the Congress get all the facts about the secret dealings soon. **********Mr. Holliday pointed out that a potential problem in granting Mr. Reagan's latest request was that the full committee would have to approve it. There was the possibility that the panel might split on what should be included in such a report, he noted. Heated Meeting at N.S.C.  In another development today, Administration officials confirmed that efforts to make staff changes at the National Security Council in the aftermath of the disclosures of the Iran-contra scheme had resulted in a tense meeting on Friday.

It will coordinate all of G.M.'s European operations, particularly Opel of West Germany and Vauxhall of Britain. **********G.M. appointed Ferdinand Beickler, the 63-year-old head of Adam Opel A.G., its big West German subsidiary, to head the centralized unit. At a news conference in Frankfurt, Mr. Beickler said the changes were aimed at ''more strongly combining'' research, styling and production throughout Europe. **********Analysts said the reshuffling paralleled changes made at Ford Europe in the 1960's, when the American auto maker laid the groundwork for a Europe-wide manufacturing and marketing network. It was also said to reflect trends now under way in Europe, as companies like Volkswagen and Peugeot try to save money through greater economies of scale in production and marketing. 'A Complex Situation' **********In Detroit, F. James McDonald, G.M.'s president, said the changes came ''in response to the increased importance and growing competitiveness of the European market.'' In a statement, Mr. McDonald said that ''substantially increased passenger car volume in Europe'' created ''a complex situation that calls for quick decisions.'' **********Much of the European management, the company said, will be drawn from Opel. Richard E. Durkin, Opel's chief financial officer, will be in charge of finances at the Zurich organization, which the company said would consist of about 200 employees, half of them from Opel. **********The changes will also affect G.M.'s British subsidiary, Vauxhall Motors Ltd. John M. Fleming, Vauxhall's chief executive, was named vice president for sales of the new European unit. **********The company said that Horst W. Herke, 54 years old, who now heads General Motors Espana S.A., the Spanish unit, would succeed Mr. Beickler as head of Opel. 'It Is Good News' **********Analysts generally welcomed the changes. ''It is good news from a General Motors standpoint,'' said Donald Kress, an auto analyst at Booz Allen & Hamilton, in Paris. **********G.M.'s European investments in recent years, such as the construction of large factories in Spain and Austria and development of the highly successful subcompact Corsa and compact Kadett models, both sold by Opel, increased G.M.'s European market share to 11.4 percent last year, from 8.2 percent in 1981. **********G.M. is still ranked fifth among the European majors, but its sales success has enabled it to close in on fourth-place Peugeot, and put it less than two percentage points behind Ford, the 1985 market leader. **********Last year, G.M.'s European production rose 10 percent, to 1,317,000 cars, from 1,200,000 in 1984. Registrations, a barometer of sales, increased to 1,210,000 cars, from 1,122,000 the year before, widening the company's European share to 11.4 percent from 11 percent in 1984. **********But the sales rise has not been matched by comparable profits. In 1984 Opel posted a loss equivalent to $163 million, and Vauxhall, the British unit, one of $99.4 million. Mr. Beickler said Opel's losses would be lower in 1985. Products Praised **********Auto analysts generally give G.M.'s European products high marks. John Lawson, senior analyst at D.R.I. Europe Ltd., in London, said, ''In a sense, they bought market share, but by investing heavily in the product.'' Auto engineers rank the Corsa and Kadett among Europe's finest products, and last year an international panel of experts named the Kadett Europe's Car of the Year. **********G.M.'s new plants, such as the big Corsa assembly factory in Saragossa, Spain, and the European engine plant near Vienna, are considered leaders in technical development. **********But the changes have been costly. In 1984, Mr. Beickler announced a five-year, $2.6 billion investment plan for Opel, to modernize factories and develop models. And the return on sales has been thin. **********''They're beginning to ask why they are not making any money in Europe,'' said Mr. Kress, the analyst at Booz Allen. **********Part of the problem, analysts say, is the G.M. product mix in Europe, where sales of small cars like the Kadett and Corsa, with thin profit margins, dominate and account for most of G.M.'s market share gains."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/20/business/company-news-goodyear-in-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goodyear in Deal", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Goodyear in Deal", "body_text": " **********The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company said it had bought Britain's Engineering Consultancy Service, a former Dunlop Ltd. subsidiary that has been researching and developing automation in tire manufacturing.

Critics say that promotions undermine the image-building investments in advertising and erode brand loyalty by encouraging consumers to make purchase decisions on the basis of price rather than brand attributes. While promotions provide a short-term lift for sales, they eventually lead to declining profits, critics contend. **********Expenditures on consumer promotions increased to 30 percent of total marketing outlays last year, from 22 percent in 1978, according to Donnelly Marketing Services. Media advertising, meanwhile, declined to 35 percent last year, from 43 percent in 1978. Trade promotions, which go directly to retailers and wholesalers, accounted for the remainder. **********According to the A. C. Nielsen Company's coupon tracking unit, manufacturers distributed 179.8 billion coupons last year, up from 102.4 billion in 1981. **********Coupons are by far the most common form of promotion, but companies are increasingly using other methods. And promotions are no longer limited to packaged goods. British Airways, for example, recently helped increase its trans-Atlantic travel through a sweepstakes that offered flyers prizes such as free trips to London and use of the Concorde for eight hours. **********Promotions, once started, can be difficult to stop. If competitors respond with similar programs, it is difficult to stop unilaterally. The result can be a spiral of profit-sapping discount offers. For example, several times in the last five years the car rental industry has plunged into promotion wars that have cost millions of dollars. **********However, promotions are by no means always destructive. Used properly, they can help persuade consumers to try a product or to use more of the product. They help gain and keep space on crowded supermarket shelves. And they can help clear out excess inventories. **********Edward D. Meyer, senior vice president and director of promotion services at DFS/Dorland, said marketers are also learning to use promotions to build brand images, rather than simply offering a savings of a few cents. Companies such as Procter & Gamble, American Express and Coors, for instance, have tied promotions to charitable causes, offering to donate money when a product is purchased or a coupon redeemed. **********''All these are really image enhancers for the company,'' he said. ''Manufacturers are looking for more and more of these.'' **********But as use of promotions has increased, the decades-old debate about their long-term efficiency has intensified. **********Robert M. Prentice, a marketing consultant in Cos Cob, Conn., who has studied the effects of different mixes of advertising and promotion spending on the long-term interests of companies, said that a certain amount of promotion is justified and necessary. **********''But there is a point beyond which companies are spending too much,'' he said. **********His case studies of 43 products and product categories found that in every instance, profits began to diminish within two years when promotion spending reached a certain percentage of total marketing spending. Depending on the product and category, that percentage might be anywhere from 30 percent to more than 70 percent, Mr. Prentice said. **********He has also found that in general, promotions are not as efficient as advertising in building long-term sales. ''I can demonstrate that most promotions cost four times as much as advertising to generate one point of market share,'' Mr. Prentice said. **********So why are companies pouring more and more money into promotions? ''It's a matter of short-term vs. long-term thinking,'' Mr. Prentice said. ''It's a sales vs. profit emphasis.'' **********He and others make the point that product managers are under pressure to generate quarterly sales increases. That encourages short-term solutions - and if it also creates long-term problems, well, who cares, because that product manager is likely to have been moved to another assignment by the time they show up a few years later."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/10/world/rabin-at-new-york-rite-calls-synagogue-raiders-animals.html": {"writer_name": "Frank Prial", "pub_date": "1986-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 444, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RABIN, AT NEW YORK RITE, CALLS SYNAGOGUE RAIDERS ANIMALS", "print_headline": "RABIN, AT NEW YORK RITE, CALLS SYNAGOGUE RAIDERS ANIMALS", "body_text": " **********Speaking at a memorial service in New York for the 21 Jews slain by Arab gunman in Istanbul last week, Israel's Defense Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, appealed yesterday to ''everyone who believes in the basic values that distinguish a human being from an animal'' to band together to fight terrorism. **********Mr. Rabin joined Israeli and Turkish diplomats, city officials and members of the American Jewish establishment at Congregation Shearith Israel, 8 West 70th Street, to condemn the killings carried out during sabbath prayers last Saturday in Neve Shalom Synagogue in Istanbul. **********''They were killed for one reason,'' Mr. Rabin said.

Heavy Demand for Aircraft **********The gain was led by the largest one-month rise in military orders in 12 years with demand particularly heavy for military aircraft. Business spending also showed strength as companies placed rush orders for computers and other equipment in order to qualify for tax treatment that is more favorable than it will be after a current law expires on Jan. 1. **********''There isn't anything of consequence in this report to get excited about,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. He predicted that the order boom would be short-lived. Many analysts believe economic growth is receiving a lift in the final three months of this year as both businesses and consumers increase spending to take advantage of expiring tax breaks, and they contend this will be followed by weaker growth in 1987 as the new tax law takes effect. **********The November increase in orders for durable goods, which are items expected to last three or more years, was the largest since an 8.2 percent order rise in November 1984. **********The 110.8 percent jump in orders for military equipment was the biggest rise since a record 140.2 percent increase in August 1974. Big Swings Not Unusual **********But analysts said big month-to-month swings in the volatile military category were not unusual, noting that military orders have ranged between $5 billion and $11 billion a month all year. Military orders totaled $10.54 billion in November after declining 43.4 percent in October. **********The key category of nonmilitary capital goods rose 7 percent, to $28.78 billion, after declining 4.6 percent the month before, with part of this gain tied to equipment purchases made to take advantage of current more liberal tax depreciation rules. **********By category, orders for transportation equipment increased 15.9 percent, to $30.3 billion, reflecting the big demand for military aircraft. Without the military orders, demand for transportation equipment would have fallen 6.4 percent with the automotive and civilian aircraft industries both showing declines.

Although Goldman's management committee had discussed in February the possibility of selling shares to the public, according to sources close to the firm, John L. Weinberg, Goldman's chairman, was reportedly startled when first approached by Sumitomo in March. **********The approach was taken seriously, though, and what followed was a series of long and complex negotiations. Advising Sumitomo was Lazard Freres & Company and its senior partner, Felix G. Rohatyn. **********Spurring Goldman to talk were two factors, according to sources close to the firm. There was the prospect, these sources said, of the withdrawal over coming years of a significant amount of capital, perhaps more than $150 million, by retiring partners. Trading Losses Cited **********Also, Goldman had suffered huge securities trading losses in February, estimated by some at as much as $200 million, prompting some partners to seek a financial cushion against their personal capital being eroded by such unpredictable setbacks, the sources, who asked not to be named, said. **********The March meeting in Mr. Weinberg's office on Wall Street was a face-to-face encounter with Koh Komatsu, Sumitomo's president, according to the sources. That first meeting had followed two months of preliminary discussions between Sumitomo, Lazard and McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm that had been working with Sumitomo for several years on a strategy for the future. **********McKinsey had approached Mr. Rohatyn late last December about taking on Sumitomo as a client. He was not told the name of the Japanese bank, or the nature of the transaction they had in mind. **********On Jan. 10 this year, the McKinsey officials showed up at his Rockefeller Center office with three Sumitomo executives, Mr. Rohatyn said yesterday. Sumitomo spelled out its plans; the big Japanese bank had already zeroed in on Goldman as the ideal partner to teach it the ways of the investment banking world. Mr. Rohatyn accepted the assignment and all sides agreed to maintain secrecy. 'A Passive Window' **********''Implicit was always the idea that they wanted a passive window into the investment banking business,'' Mr. Rohatyn commented. ''I told them that we had the highest regard for Goldman, that they were one of the best-managed, if not the best-managed, firms in the business.'' **********Mr. Rohatyn flew to Tokyo with his wife in February to meet with Sumitomo's top officers. So strict was the secrecy that Mr. Rohatyn was not even able to tell his son, who works at an American bank in Tokyo, the real purpose of the two-day visit. **********As a further precaution, Mr. Rohatyn met with the Sumitomo officers in a guest house owned by the bank. **********After weighing Sumitomo's aims and how they might be met, much of this through an interpreter, Mr. Rohatyn set up the March meeting with Mr. Weinberg, to whom the idea had not yet been broached. At first, Goldman was cool to the idea, several sources said, but was willing to talk because of longstanding relations with Sumitomo. **********Soon, Mr. Rohatyn was joined by three Lazard partners, George Ames, David Dillard and Luis Rinaldini. At Sumitomo, Hiroshi Mineoka, a senior managing director, took charge. Goldman was represented by Donald R. Gant, a partner, and Robert A. Friedman, the firm's chief financial officer. **********The negotiations were long and difficult, sources said. Sumitomo appreciated from the start that it would have to accept a minority role in the firm's ownership and that it would not be able to have a voting interest. American regulations limit the voting ownership a commercial bank may take in an investment bank to less than 5 percent. But even with a nonvoting stake, Sumitomo had to steer clear of a conflict. A Complex Structure **********Finally, a complex structure evolved where Sumitomo would be a limited partner, holding, at first, very little equity in the firm, and mostly debt securities, in return for an investment of $500 million. Those securities will gradually turn into equity, according to one source, until the stake reaches 12.5 percent. Also, the sides agreed to an escape hatch - the arrangement can be dissolved by either side after 10 years. **********It was only about two months ago that the negotiations seemed serious enough to suggest that a deal would be concluded. Goldman's partners met about six weeks ago and decided to go ahead, sources said. **********Mr. Rohatyn described it as the longest and most complex negotiations he had ever been involved in.

And scarcely a day passes in which a Government official is not quoted calling for the same ''structural changes,'' saying that Mexico cannot progress without them. **********Rarely are the changes spelled out. Rather, the vague references are part of a low-key Government campaign that has become a litany, a seemingly ordinary recitation of longstanding policy. **********But in reality, ''structural changes'' are code words for a new economic direction that President Miguel de la Madrid is attempting, which would bring to Mexico the sort of free-market economy long advocated by President Reagan as the best engine of economic growth. On several fronts, the de la Madrid administration is turning away from a system that for decades has kept social peace by subsidizing many sectors of the Mexican economy, providing strong support for Mexican-owned companies and protecting them from the competition of world trade. **********Now, in a bid to attract more foreign investment, the Government is relaxing rules that had barred foreign companies from majority ownership in their Mexican operations. They are rules that have their roots in the Mexican revolution of 1910. The Government is also trying to divest itself of some of the hundreds of state-owned companies, many of which have been money-losers for years. And as a prelude to membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which it hopes will strengthen its trade position, it is dismantling its restrictive import-licensing system. **********The problem, however, is that the changes are being made just as world oil markets are collapsing, throwing Mexico into a huge economic crisis. **********The plunging crude prices have made many Mexicans feel like prisoners of oil - and that, in turn, is increasing pressure on politicians and economic planners to move toward accepting a new economic order, particularly the goal of diversification into non-oil exports. Yet the changes have the potential to draw substantial politicial opposition and that opposition could force the Government to abandon - or modify -some of the moves it has made. **********''The direction they have taken is the correct one and they have no choice but to follow it,'' one economist said. ''But what happens to oil prices and Mexico's need for new financial help from abroad greatly complicates everything.'' **********The Mexican Government, which devised the plan last year after watching the economy get battered by a steady decline in oil prices, owns its petroleum resources and extracts and sells oil through Petroleos Mexicanos, a state-run monopoly. Oil, rather than tax revenue, generates a large part of Government revenues -41 percent, in fact - and accounts for 70 percent of export earnings. **********The steady decline of oil prices in recent years has generated large Government deficits - almost 10 percent of the 1985 gross domestic product, or more than $8 billion. The deficits are largely responsible for inflation rates of 63 percent last year and a shortage of credit that has plagued Mexican businesses. And economic planners are revising their budgetary expectations as crude oil prices plunge even more. It means that Mexico's borrowing needs will likely be greater, now that the foreign currency earned from oil exports fall far short of serving Mexico's $97 billion debt, which requires about $9 billion in annual interest payments. **********The Government believes it will have a deficit this year about equal to the interest payment, although some American officials and foreign bankers think that estimate is high. Whatever the figure, the assumption is that Mexico must receive more financial help, either through new loans from banks and international organizations, or, as Mexico would prefer, through reductions or postponements of interest payments. **********Additional financial aid or an easing of the interest payments in effect give the de la Madrid Government more time to carry out its economic changes. Since the debt crisis began in 1982, the Government has introduced many austerity measures, in an attempt to rein in the deficits and put the economy on an even keel. **********International lending agencies such as the International Monetary Fund, which have played a key role in extending credit to Mexico in recent years, have been pushing for the economic changes slowly being tried by Mr. de la Madrid. Increasingly, the need to open the Mexican economy has been tied to further loans. The Baker Plan, named after United States Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and which would extend further loans to Latin American debtor countries, emphasizes the need for the countries to open up their economies in order to grow. But how to do this in Mexico's case? Mr. de la Madrid's answer has been to quietly embark upon a bold economic liberalization program designed to lessen the Government's overwhelming dominance of the economy, integrate Mexico into the world economic order after decades of protectionism and greatly expand non-petroleum exports. He seems to be proceeding quietly so as not to rock the political boat too severely in a year when a number of key governorships and mayoralties are up for election. **********Taken singly, all the Government's economic moves do not seem particularly earthshaking. As a whole, however, they reflect a significant policy shift as important as any since the Mexican revolution began in 1910. What remains to be seen, of course, is whether the plan will work. Numerous obstacles stand in the way, the most potentially troublesome of which is Mexican politics. **********The liberalization flies in the face of long-held and cherished tenets of Mexican political philosophy. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known here as P.R.I., has held power for nearly six decades by pulling a diversity of interest groups under its political tent. But there is something in virtually every element of the economic reforms likely to draw opposition from one politically powerful group or another. ONE of the tenets of the plan is to relax Mexico's rules barring foreign companies from majority ownership of their operations in Mexico. Mr. de la Madrid says that Mexico will choose the companies allowed to have 100 ownership on a case-by-case basis. He hopes that foreign manufacturers will generate exports, create jobs and bolster investors' confidence. But last year, officials say they received commitments from foreign investors totaling only about $1.8 billion - and that actual investments came to only about $400 million. **********At least part of this difference is attributed to foreign investors' lack of confidence. There are fears that the relaxation of foreign investment rules might later be tightened, making it difficult for a company to earn an adequate return. Potential foreign investors also worry about the possibility of future expropriation of their Mexican operations if government policies change. What also complicates the plan, diplomats say, is the fact that companies permitted to own 100 percent will be chosen on a case-by-case basis, a situation that diplomats consider too arbitrary. **********Chrysler, Ford and General Motors already have fully-owned operations in Mexico, but they were established under deals negotiated decades ago. Now, the International Business Machines Corporation is the Government's most notable success story of a big company coming in under the rule change. I.B.M. will invest $90 million in new Mexican facilities and retain full ownership. It plans to manufacture XT personal computers, exporting 90 percent of the factory's output. Projections are for exports of $600 million in five years, which would thrust I.B.M. into the ranks of Mexico's top 10 exporters. **********But I.B.M. received permission to build its new plant and retain full ownership only after first being rejected and then entering into long negotiations. In the process, I.B.M. had to agree to invest $84 million more than it had originally intended, accept some marketing restrictions and agree to help Mexico create a semi-conductor design center in which microchip design technology will be taught to Mexican companies. MR. DE LA MADRID has also ordered that the Government divest itself of some of the hundreds of state-owned companies that have been a hallmark of the Mexican economy. Besides owning such things as the oil, electrical and communications industries, which will be retained, the Government also owns a host of companies ranging from hotels and steel mills to bakeries and motion picture companies. **********Many of these companies are industrial derelicts, plagued by labor troubles or requiring huge subsidies to survive. Indeed, economists and bankers estimate that half of the Government's deficit is generated by subsidies to the state-owned enterprises. So far, however, lines of eager investors waiting to buy the companies have not materialized. **********''Who would want to invest his money in a bankrupt company or a company with irresolvable labor problems?'' asked one Mexican bank executive who requested anonymity. **********Last year, 236 Government-owned companies were ordered liquidated, sold or transferred to state governments. Many of the companies were acquired when they went bankrupt, others when their demise threatened to create unemployment. Some were created because the Government thought it could do a better job or better protect the public interest. **********So far, the major sale has been in the hotel industry. Last fall, a group of hotels and restaurants, including some of Mexico City's best hotels and hotels in several other major cities, were sold by the Government for $60 million to a group of Mexican investors. The hotel group was described as one of the few Government-owned enterprises on the auction block that was profitable. **********Despite that, hotel owners familiar with the sale said that most prospective buyers had been reluctant. They felt the terms for the sale were not sufficiently favorable and that the general decline in Mexico's tourist industry was a threat to future profitability. But a deal was concluded, a hotel executive said, ''after the Government did some arm twisting.'' **********The Government's attempt to sell its steel works on the Pacific Coast near the town of Lazaro Cardenas illustrates some of the problems faced. Several groups of foreign investors have studied the possibility of buying all or a part of the complex, at prices said to range from $600 million for part of the complex to $1.5 billion for it all. But each investor group has backed away. **********''The major barrier to anyone considering buying it is the prospect of being in partnership with the Government,'' said a Mexican businessman who represented one group of potential foreign investors. ''The price for which you can sell your steel is set by the Government. But you also must buy your electricity and coal and natural gas from the Government, which sets those prices. The Government runs the railroads and decides what transportation is to cost. The more you look into the matter, the more difficult appears the prospect of turning a profit.'' **********The Government also has begun dismantling its complicated and highly restrictive import licensing system, in which items could be imported only after laborious and time-consuming applications for import permission. **********Although import licenses still remain on about one-third of all items, for the other two-thirds, only tariffs now stand in the way. Admittedly, the tariffs are quite high in some cases. But expectations are they will be gradually lowered and the remaining license requirements eventually eliminated. Moving to a tariff system is a prelude to Mr. de la Madrid's other major change - the decision late last year to enter GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. **********In its move away from import licenses, the Government could face problems. With its trade balance already endangered by falling oil prices, Government economists fear that imports will soar because Mexican consumers want foreign goods. They say this loss of foreign exchange could more than offset any increase in non-petroleum exports generated by the early effects of the economic liberalization. That could further exacerbate economic problems, forcing the Government to sharply restrict imports. Relations with GATT would then become more complicated. THE LOOMING DANGEROF LOWER TARIFFS **********MEXICO CITY As Mexico becomes a member of GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the potentially large Mexican consumer market will be opened gradually to foreign competition and Mexican products will be more easily marketed abroad. **********The Government hopes that Mexican manufacturers, particularly the small and mid-sized companies, will be able to increase their efficiency and product quality so that they will not lose markets to superior foreign-made products. **********But Government and private economists believe that Mexico's decision to join GATT, which will gradually pull down high tariff walls, will cause some Mexican industrial concerns to fail in the face of foreign competition. ''I personally believe the number of failures is going to be larger and the process more painful than the Government is letting on,'' said one foreign diplomat, who asked not to named. ''But there are many other Mexican companies that are ready and will thrive under GATT.'' GATT is an international group that fosters trade between nations. **********Mexico decided to enter GATT once before, during the previous administration of President Jose Lopez Portillo. But opposition developed and, since Mexico was still basking in seemingly endless petroleum wealth, the decision was revoked. **********Now there seems to be little choice. Mexican trade negotiators traveled to Geneva last week for preliminary discussions about entering GATT. They are optimistically predicting entry by next September, but expect to obtain agreement allowing the Mexican economy to be phased gradually into GATT. Eliminating the import licensing system, which often required a year or more to obtain permission to import an item, and sometimes involved favoritism, bribes or other special considerations, was a necessary prelude to membership."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/business/the-executive-computer-extra-power-without-the-hassles.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Sandberg-Diment", "pub_date": "1986-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1320, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXTRA POWER, WITHOUT THE HASSLES", "print_headline": "THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER; EXTRA POWER, WITHOUT THE HASSLES", "body_text": " **********THE Software Publishing Corporation has had remarkable success with its basic, no-frills software packages, familiar to most under the company's own PFS label and to others as the Assistant series licensed to I.B.M. The PFS family of programs offers about 80 percent of the features that most users need in, say, a word processor or a data base manager. More important, these programs are capable of being put to work by the average - even the computer-shy - individual without any of the mental gymnastics so often associated with computer software. **********But a new generation of users is with us. People who have been employing such no-frills software for a year or so now have become reasonably comfortable with computing, thanks to these relatively effortless programs. Most of these users are not about to trade in their PFS:File, say, for dBase III. The latter is still a program for the aficionado. But 80 percent is no longer enough for many users. If they are not ready to go the full route, they would at least like something offering 90 percent of the features they want - although without any more complexity than they are already coping with. **********It is this market of movers-on that Q & A ($299 for the I.B.M. PC family and compatibles from the Symantec Corporation, Cupertino, Calif., 95014, (800) 441-2345) seems to be addressing. And in large measure, the program succeeds in remaining as easy to run as more limited file managers, while offering many of the more complex features of a true data base manager. In short, the program offers 90 percent, maybe even 95 percent, of the functions needed in a business data base manager, and combines these with almost effortless ease of use. **********Q & A's biggest hurdle in capturing the market it is wooing is probably the fact that the tutorial accompanying the program is not complete or interactive enough to carry the user over the initial learning hump, however small that hump might seem compared with other programs. What makes clambering over the hurdle easier, however, is the fact that the program is quite similar to PFS:File in both appearance and structure. **********Those who have dealt with the PFS software will be halfway home before they start. They will also discover that Q & A includes among its many attractions not only the file manager and a report generator to extract information from those files and print it out as desired, but a quite useful word processor integrated into the package as well. **********The word processing segment of the software can, in fact, be used by itself. It allows the user to delete single words, lines or entire blocks of text; copy and move blocks of text from one area of a document to another; assign temporary margins; search for given words in the text and, if desired, replace them with others; take an automatic word count, and merge files. All of these features take the ''What you see on screen is what you get on paper'' form. **********Some bells and whistles are missing. The program does not, for instance, have footnote capabilities. But obviously, the program will serve for most business applications, and even supplies some touches that business users will find quite handy. One such feature is its envelope printing option. **********When composing letters using Q & A, one need not enter names and addresses a second time in a separate address file in order to have envelopes printed for the enclosures, as is so often necessary with other packages. Instead, Q & A searches letters for the initial name and address and prints these out in standard business-sized envelope format. **********How does it know which part of the letter provides the address to which the missive is supposed to go? Well, that's where the program's so-called artificial intelligence comes in, although ''automatic abstraction'' might be a more appropriate term for its capabilities. What Q & A does is to search the document for the first line of text beginning at the left margin. It ignores any lines that are indented, like the sender's address. It also ignores any line ending in two or more digits, for instance March 9, 1986, interpreting such an entry as a date. **********Once past this process of elimination, the envelope addressing facility prints all the lines it finds flush left until it comes to one that is blank. Thus international addresses and others containing more than the standard four lines present no problem. On the envelope, the address is positioned 10 lines down and 3 1/2 inches from the left edge. INFORMATION from Q & A files can easily be merged into documents produced by the word processing segment of the program. Consider, for instance, the ubiquitous form letter. All that is needed to generate the individually addressed copies of such a letter is to insert an asterisk as a marker on either side of the field name corresponding to an entry in the data base. **********For example, entering ''Dear *title* *last name*'' at the beginning of the letter would result in the automatic salutations ''Dear Miss Willard,'' ''Dear Mr. Lewis'' and so on throughout the whole gamut of individuals chosen to receive the letter. The same ''*title* *last name*'' sprinkled throughout the body of the letter would further customize the missive with all the familiar ''Now you, Miss Willard, have been chosen . . .'' or if one preferred, the less formal ''*first name* *last name*'' ''Now you, Nancy Willard, have been chosen . . ..'' **********The selection of the range of data to be used by a form document, in this case the people to whom the letter is to go, say all one's potential customers in Oklahoma, is made by using the program's Search function. One would simply ask one's machine to call up all the addresses with Oklahoma zip codes. **********The real plus of Q & A, however, is the ease with which a data base can be designed and reports generated from it. To design a form, one simply selects the Design File function and scribbles away on screen as if the display were a piece of scratch paper. Field names are delineated simply by colons or the ''less than'' and ''greater than'' symbols. **********Once a layout has been completed, a Format screen is called up so that the type of data to be placed in each field can be specified. Q & A also provides for text, numerical and some special data types such as, for example, hours or dates and incorporates logic functions such as yes/no. A Customize File menu permits one to restrict values in such a way that, for example, a typist cannot enter, say, $2,000 in a field covering items costing less than $20. **********All in all, I found the least useful feature of Q & A to be its Intelligent Assistant, the much touted arificial intelligence component of the program. The software comes with a 400-word vocabulary and the users can ''teach'' the program what the particular data base in use is all about. Then one can instruct it in plain English to, say, ''list the total salaries for the marketing department,'' and the program should do just that. It's all very cute, and, I am sure it's a great sales tool. But surely the program would have been virtually as effectve a working tool without the assistance of its ''intelligence.'' **********It seemed to me that the primary effect of the Intelligent Assistant was to eat up memory, in an already memory-hungry program. All the same, whether one considers the Intelligent Assistant to be a boon or not, Q & A is probably the best middle-of-the-road data base manager currently available."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/11/business/company-news-mcdonnell-and-airbus-differ.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McDonnell and Airbus Differ", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; McDonnell and Airbus Differ", "body_text": " **********Airbus Industrie said today that it had failed to reach an accord with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation to build a long-range civilian airliner, although the two groups had not ruled out eventual longer-term cooperation in other areas.

He said they had agreed that the trip should go ahead even though there was a strong possibility of a clash with Libya while Mr. Shultz was in the region. **********He said in an earlier news conference in Ankara that even though Colonel Qaddafi ''belonged in a box,'' the purpose of the trip was to demonstrate resolve not to allow international seas and airspace to be denied the United States and other nations. **********Mr. Shultz was asked how he would deal with countries that have not condemned Libya, including Greece, where he is to remain until Friday morning, and Italy, where he will spend the weekend. He replied that both nations should support the United States since they both use international seas. **********''Greece and Italy are both martime nations, and therefore they have a stake in being able to sail their ships in international waters,'' he said. ''And they have a stake in not being shot at in international waters. And everybody who has that stake should be standing around, applauding the United States.'' **********Mr. Shultz said he had explained the American motivation for using force against Libya in his meeting with the President of Turkey, Gen. Kenan Evren, earlier today. **********He said the Turkish leader had a ''fascinating response,'' but declined to say what it was. Turkey, which in the past has resisted American efforts to join in sanctions against Libya, had not issued a statement by the time Mr. Shultz left for Greece. **********American security has been particularly concerned about Mr. Shultz's safety on this trip. Protection in Ankara and Istanbul, where Mr. Shultz spent last weekend, was tight, and it seems to have increased in Greece.

That agreement runs out in 1988, and Mr. Shultz has said that budget decisions have to be made in Washington shortly and that the Administration wants to know the status of the bases for future planning. **********Mr. Papandreou described the agreement when it was signed in 1983 as one that would be terminated in 1988.

But the similarity is misleading. **********Both are typical high fliers in the French civil service, brilliant graduates of France's elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration who made their careers in the Finance Ministry. Both climbed to the top, holding the prestigious post of Directeur du Tresor, the Finance Ministry's senior civil service job. They are close in age: Mr. Camdessus is 53 years old, Mr. de Larosiere, 57. **********Central Bank Rumors **********The new director, it is true, comes to the fund after serving as governor of the French central bank, a distinction Mr. de Larosiere has not yet achieved. But he soon may. If the Paris rumor mills are right, the reason France's conservative Government fought so hard to get Mr. Camdessus the prestigious I.M.F. post was to permit it to replace him with Mr. de Larosiere without offending President Francois Mitterrand, the country's Socialist head of state. Mr. Mitterrand had appointed Mr. Camdessus to the central bank. **********Yet despite this superficial sense of continuity, Mr. Camdessus's appointment may prove a turning point in the I.M.F.'s development at a time when its position in the world economic system is clearly in flux. **********First, the indecorous and unprecedented public struggle for the post, which pitted Mr. Camdessus against H. Onno Ruding, the Dutch Finance Minister, has weakened Europe's traditional claim to nominate the I.M.F.'s managing director since the United States always appoints the head of its sister organization, the World Bank. (With the Camdessus appointment, France continues to hold down the three top international economic posts in the Western World, including the presidency of the European Common Market's executive commission in Brussels and the Secretary General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.) Possible Opening for Japanese Because Europe had a contest for a candidate this time, many monetary officials believe it will now be easier for Japan, or another financially important country, to claim the I.M.F. job for one its citizens when the post becomes vacant in five years. **********More important, however, are signs that Mr. Camdessus's appointment could bring a more creative approach to the I.M.F.'s two major concerns - the continuing third world debt crisis and the campaign begun by major Western nations at their Tokyo summit meeting last May to achieve faster growth and more stable currencies through better coordination of economic policy. **********Mr. Camdessus brings to the I.M.F. extensive knowledge of the third world's debt problems and sympathy for that sector. Both were acquired at the French Finance Ministry where he ran the so-called Paris Club, a secretive body in which debt-ridden developing countries negotiate special terms with Western creditor nations. Disenchantment With I.M.F. Moreover, Mr. Camdessus is taking over at the I.M.F. just when current approaches to the debt crisis are manifestly running out of steam, with private banks reluctant to increase their third world exposure and developing countries growing increasingly disenchanted with the I.M.F.'s harsh economic recommendations. **********Mr. Camdessus's close association with the French Socialists also suggests that he may strive for a new and more flexible approach to the developing world's difficulties. **********Just as Mr. de Larosiere made no secret of his conservative affiliations, serving as former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing's chief of staff when he was Finance Minister, so Mr. Camdessus's career prospered under the Socialists after they came to power in 1981. It was the Socialists who gave him the top Finance Ministry job in 1982, and two years later made him governor of the central bank. Lessons From the Socialists **********Yet his close association with the Socialists also taught him the importance of a cooperative, international approach to economic policy making, as well as a healthy respect for conservative values. **********As head of the French Treasury he presided over President Mitterrand's disastrous dash for growth in 1981. The policy led to three devaluations of the franc and pushed the country to the brink of bankruptcy. **********But Mr. Camdessus also presided over the Socialists' great about-face on economic policy in 1983, when they decided on austerity and discovered the virtues of lower taxes, higher profits and more economic freedom. **********And as governor of the central bank, Mr. Camdessus was a model of financial orthodoxy, adopting a tough anti-inflationary monetary policy and deregulating France's financial markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/business/carter-hawley-silent-on-offer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Carter Hawley Silent on Offer", "print_headline": "Carter Hawley Silent on Offer", "body_text": " **********Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., the owner of Bergdorf Goodman Inc. and Neiman Marcus, said yesterday that it would not comment on whether it had responded to a $1.8 billion cash offer for the retailer made a week ago today. **********Yesterday was the deadline for a response set by The Limited, a major retailer, and the Edward J.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 says every employee has to submit a new W-4 to the employer to make sure that enough is being withheld from paychecks in light of the sweeping tax changes. Workers who expect to pay more tax under the new law may need to have more money withheld from their earnings. Others may be able to have less withheld. The Internal Revenue Service plans to introduce the new forms and instructions this month and send them to employers in December. **********Although the new law gives employees until next Oct. 1 to fill out the new W-4 forms, the I.R.S. is encouraging them to act much sooner. **********Making Estimated Payments **********''We're urging they do it as quickly as possible so they are withheld at the proper amount during 1987 and don't run into the danger of being under-withheld,'' said Roderick Young, a spokesman for the agency. **********The income tax is still a pay-as-you-go system, so people must pay taxes during the year either through payroll withholding or by paying estimated taxes to the I.R.S. in quarterly installments. Otherwise, the taxpayer can be subject to penalties. **********For those who must pay estimated taxes, the new law requires that their payments total 100 percent of their previous year's tax liability or 90 percent of the current year's expected tax liability. Taxpayers are allowed to pay according to either formula. The 90 percent figure was increased from 80 percent under the old law. Amounts withheld from wages count as estimated tax payments. **********The first quarterly payment to be affected by the 90 percent guideline will be April 15, 1987, which is the due date of the first estimated payment for the 1987 tax year. **********Taxpayers do not have to make estimated tax payments if the amount they would owe through this method is less than $500 a year. Social Security Numbers for Children Parents also will need to get a Social Security number for each son and daughter who is at least 5 years old. Parents have more than a year to complete the task because these numbers will not have to be reported until they file their income tax returns in early 1988. At that time, parents need to include the Social Security number for every child of age 5 or older for whom a dependency exemption is claimed. **********Congress imposed this requirement because the Internal Revenue Service found that many parents had been claiming more dependency exemptions on their tax returns than they were entitled to. Sometimes both divorced spouses claimed an exemption for the same child. In other cases, parents claimed exemptions for fictitious dependents. **********The Social Security Administration expects to issue an additional nine million Social Security cards next year because of the new requirement. Last year the agency issued 5.7 million new cards. How to Apply for a Number **********Parents can apply for the number either at their local Social Security office or by mail. John B. Trollinger, a spokesman for the agency, said they should write or phone the local Social Security office for application form SS-5. Along with this form they will need to submit a certified copy of the child's birth certificate (a plain photocopy is not acceptable) or other documentary proof of age, as well as something providing proof of the child's identity, such as a school identification card. **********The Social Security Administration will return these documents to the applicant after it processes the application, Mr. Trollinger said. **********Neglecting to include the correct Social Security number on a tax return will draw a $5 penalty. The reporting rule goes into effect for returns due on or after Jan. 1, 1988. Tax-Exempt Interest **********On the tax returns due at that time, taxpayers also must start reporting all the tax-exempt interest they receive. Most people will not have to pay a cent in taxes on such interest, but Congress decided to make everybody report it. This is being done partly to assure compliance with the revised alternative minimum tax, which will make some upper-income individuals subject to tax on certain recently issued private-purpose municipal bonds. **********Lawmakers also wanted to make sure that higher-income retired people correctly figure the tax, if any, on their Social Security benefits. As under the old law, retirees have to pay tax on part of their Social Security benefits if their adjusted gross income plus tax-exempt interest and half their Social Security benefits exceeds $32,000 on a joint return or $25,000 for single individuals. New Passport Form **********When you apply for a United States passport or renew the one you have, beginning in 1987, you will have a new I.R.S. form to fill out. Everyone will have to fill it out, even if just going on a short vacation overseas, but the form is actually intended to help the I.R.S. track down American citizens living abroad who fail to pay their share of United States income taxes. According to a recent Congressional estimate, 61 percent of the 1.8 million American civilians living abroad fail to file a tax return. New Form 1099's **********Beginning in 1987, the new law requires new Form 1099 reports, which are sent to the I.R.S. by financial institutions and other payers of interest and other forms of income. Real estate transactions will have to be reported by the person responsible for the closing, which is usually the settlement attorney or the title insurance company. Royalty payments of $10 or more also have to be reported, compared with a $600 minimum under the old law. **********The I.R.S. is getting some more potent weapons for its arsenal. ''The penalties for carelessness and intentional 'carelessness' are getting tougher,'' said Albert Ellentuck, national tax partner at the accounting firm of Laventhol & Horwath. **********Tax-shelter investors will face a $250 penalty for failing to report the tax-shelter identification number provided by the general partner on their tax return. **********Taxpayers who fail to include any income shown on Form 1099's face a negligence penalty of 5 percent of the underpaid tax. Under the old law, the penalty applied only to interest and dividend reports. **********Interest on late tax payments will be set one percentage point higher than the rate the I.R.S. pays taxpayers on overpayments of tax. Aggressive Claims **********In an effort to discourage taxpayers from taking aggressive positions in calculating their tax, Congress sharply increased the penalty for ''substantial understatement'' of tax. Understatement is the difference between what the I.R.S. asserts is the correct tax and the tax as shown on your return. You are deemed to have substantially understated your tax if the understatement is more than 10 percent of the correct tax or more than $5,000 - whichever is larger. **********The tax revision bill raised the penalty on substantial understatement to 20 percent, from 10 percent. But Congress subsequently passed budget legislation before it adjourned that increases the penalty to 25 percent and makes it apply to penalties assessed after Oct. 21, 1986. So the increased penalty could apply to returns previously filed as well as to returns due in the future. **********The increased penalty will make many tax advisers and taxpayers think twice before taking an aggressive position on the tax treatment of certain items on tax returns. When the Tax Dollars Are Big **********''You've got to be very sure that you've got substantial authority for your position - particularly if the tax dollars are big,'' said Gerald Padwe, national director of tax practice at the accounting firm of Touche Ross & Company. **********The amount of the understatement, Mr. Ellentuck said, can be reduced only if you have ''substantial authority'' for the position taken, such as court precedents, or if you disclose the relevant facts and basis for the tax treatment. ''The new penalty gives a big incentive for disclosing,'' he said. **********According to Mr. Padwe, an example of a position that might be subject to the penalty is someone trying to claim a deduction for a 20-year subscription to an investment journal. **********''You probably can't do it,'' he said. He termed it unlikely that you could find substantial authority for taking an immediate deduction for 20 years' worth of such an expense as opposed to allocating the cost over 20 years. **********NEXT: Long-term tax strategies and the new law."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/09/world/white-house-don-t-want-act-like-judge-excerpts-testimony-shultz-mcfarlane-house.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 7904, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM TESTIMONY BY SHULTZ AND McFARLANE IN HOUSE", "print_headline": "THE WHITE HOUSE: 'I DON'T WANT TO ACT LIKE A JUDGE'; EXCERPTS FROM TESTIMONY BY SHULTZ AND McFARLANE IN HOUSE", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from testimony of Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Robert C. McFarlane, former national security adviser, at the House Foreign Affairs Committee in Washington yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times: **********George P. Shultz REPRESENTATIVE FASCELL: The committee meets this morning to continue its public hearings on the President's foreign policy initiative toward Iran and the diversion or the allocation of funds to the contras. The committee began its hearings on Nov. 24, taking testimony from Deputy Secretary of State Mr. Whitehead. At that hearing, I made clear that the President's initiative raised very grave and unprecedented implications for the effective foreign relations coordination and implementation of U. S. foreign policy. So we continue to seek explanations of just what our policy is, what we hoped to achieve, who recommended it, where do we go from here. ... **********Now I'm pleased to recognize our ranking Republican member, Mr. Broomfield. **********REPRESENTATIVE BROOMFIELD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This morning we begin a series of hearings that should assist the committee greatly in the review of U. S. policies toward the Middle East, Central America and terrorism, and its review of the effectiveness of the current organization of the U. S. Government for formulating and implementing U. S. foreign policy. **********The Iran initiative apparently began with a good idea; namely, that the U. S. should make an effort to try to improve relations with some moderate elements in Iran. I think that was a worthy objective, which we could have supported. But some of the means used in the efforts to achieve that objective, such as arms transfer, were extremely ill-advised and mistaken. I remain gravely concerned that officials were - who thought that they saw a promise of quick success - endangered long-term objectives of U. S. foreign policy. **********I think the greatest disappointment with this whole matter stems from the transfer to the Nicaraguan resistance of funds generated by arms sales to Iran in a matter the committee has yet to ascertain. Many of us in Congress, Mr. Secretary - both Republicans and Democrats - have worked very hard within the hall of Congress to secure Congressional approval of U. S. support for the contras. The strategic interests of the United States in continuing to stand with the Nicaraguan freedom fighters has not changed. ... Secretary's Role **********SECRETARY SHULTZ: Before I read my opening statement, let me just remark quickly on the two comments that have been made by the chairman and the ranking member. And I'll interweave my reactions because you both touched basically on the same things. **********First of all, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Broomfield, you asked in one way or another about my role in the diversion of funds for aid to the Nicaraguan resistance. My role in that was zero. I know nothing about it, until it came out. So I don't have anything that I can contribute to your deliberations on exactly how that came about. ... **********The hearings you are holding, Mr. Chairman, come at a crucial point for the nation. The President has recognized that serious problems have been created on our conduct of foreign affairs by the manner in which some individuals implemented our effort to establish better contacts with Iran, and by the diversion of funds from arms sales to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance. **********He has taken the lead in rectifying any problems that may exist. ... **********He has ordered me to implement an interagency study of our relations with Iran and that process is under way with the experienced leadership of Under Secretary Armacost. And he has instructed his Cabinet officers to share with the Congress and the American people all that they knew about the recent initiative toward Iran, which is why I'm here with you this morning. ... **********I want to put to rest now any doubt as to my readiness to respond to questions about my prior knowledge and activity. I have already made all the information at my disposal available to the F.B.I. I have been interviewed by the Department of Justice. I am ready in this open session to bring forward all the materials I properly can, and at whatever appropriate time you choose I am prepared to make a statement and to answer questions in closed session, giving classified details of my knowledge and activities. ... **********We must put recent events into proper historical perspective. The President has been here for six years. When he took over, the nation was neither as secure nor as confident as it should have been. President's Policies **********Where do we stand after six years of President Reagan's leadership in foreign affairs? Working with Congress and with the broad support of the American people, President Reagan's policies have brought us to a threshold of a new and remarkably different world, a world in which America's interests, America's pride and American's ideal are flourishing. ... **********Only a few years ago, the democracies of the world were believed to be an embattled, shrinking handful of nations. Today, people struggling under oppressive regimes of the right and the left can see democracy as a vital force for the future. Vital but nonviolent movements toward more open societies have succeeded. The failure of closed, command economies is more evident every day. A new wind of change is blowing. People who are ready to stand up for freedom and have no choice but to fight for their rights now know that Communism's march is not inevitable. **********President Reagan is a freedom-fighter and the world knows it. And I stand with Ronald Reagan. Strong defenses, sound alliances and support for the free economic and political development of peoples everywhere, that's what President Reagan stands for. His policies are not the policies of a party, they are the policies of all the American people. They are inevitable policies if our country is to remain the best and greatest on earth, and the hope of humanity everywhere. **********Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ... **********REPRESENTATIVE FASCELL: Now, it has been alleged that you were opposed to this Iranian initiative, Mr. Secretary, as a member of the National Security Council, Secretary of State. If you were, did you convey your concern to the President and, if you did, when did you do it? **********A. I conveyed my concerns on many occasions, in two full meetings, on another occasion, according to my records, and I don't think anyone involved in this is under any illusion whatever about my views. **********Q. I'm not sure whether or not you conveyed your concern to the President or not. A. Yes.  Q. In opposition to the Iranian arms deal. . . . **********A. Let me comment on that, Mr. Chairman. I supported and continue to support, as my statement indicates, the idea of trying to see if we can't rearrange the furniture a little bit insofar as Iran is concerned. And there are various ways to try to do that which I support, and which is the President's basic intent. So I support his policy. However, when it comes to the use of arms, I have a different view. But I do believe that it's a legitmate subject for debate as a policy matter. The President listened to views, pro and con, and he has said publicly that in the end he decided that he should send a signal - I think that was his word -to Iran to show our serious intent. And so he authorized some arms shipments to Iran for that purpose. ... **********REPRESENTATIVE BROOMFIELD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, there's two aspects of this that really disturb me, and one is the arms transfer to Iran, which I thought was extremely ill-advised. But my question this morning deals with the transfer of funds to support the contra effort. Over the weekend, we read about the Sultan of Brunei contributing large sums of money into a secret Swiss bank account to support the contras. I wonder how many other third world countries have done the same thing, who has control of this fund and who handles it, basically? What knowledge do you have on that particular fund that circumvents what I believe the spirit of the law in support of the contra effort in Nicaragua? **********A. First of all, it would not be proper for me to talk about any particular third country and so I will not do that. I did see a report in the press that during a visit to Brunei last summer, I raised this issue, or sold the Sultan on transferring funds. That is not correct. I did visit Brunei, it was the only Asean country that I had not visited and I wanted to visit each of them, just as I try to stop in the Pacific island states . . . on that same trip. But there were no conversations with any Bruneian during that visit by me of this matter. Humanitarian Aid **********Having said that, let me go on and say - first reminding you that in August 1985, Congress approved $27 million in humanitarian aid for the Nicarauguan democratic resistance. The funds were appropriated in December for obligation through March 31, 1986. At the time the Congress expressly confirmed that, in addition to expending this $27 million the law did not preclude - I'm quoting from the law that you passed - ''activities of the Department of State to solicit such humanitarian assistance for the Nicaraguan democratic resistance.'' So it was a perfectly proper activity for the Department of State, for me, to do that. There's nothing illegal about it, there's nothing improper about it. Quite the contrary, it was the policy of the United States, put into place by Congressional action, signed by the President after due debate, to provide humanitarian assistance and to permit the Department of State to solicit funds. **********We went about it very carefully and considered it last summer because, with the delays, you remember, in enacting the final appropriations -even though both Houses had voted -the resistance was having great trouble. They were incurring debts, they didn't have funds. And so, in discussions with Assistant Secretary Abrams, we tried to think through where we might properly solicit some funds. We wanted to be very careful that we lived completely by the spirit, let alone the letter, of the law and didn't get involved with a country where it might be thought that we had tremendous leverage, say, because of our aid program or something of that kind. So we were very, very careful about that. 1st ADD CAPITAL TEXT xxx careful about that. And we did successfully persuade one Government to make a contribution. So that is what we did. The discussions with the Government were conducted by Assistant Secretary Abrams, but with my authority explicity. And I feel very good about anything that I can do to support the people in Nicaragua who are fighting for the freedom and independence of that country. If you don't think it's of any significance, let me just read you a snippet, a little insight into what's going on down there, excerpts from a report I got the other day from our embassy in Nicaragua. And there are people in our embassy who have been around. This is - I'm just reading from this report: **********''The Nicaraguan Communists celebrated their anniversary this year on Nov. 7, exactly the anniversary date of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The Soviet motif was nicely carried through, as the special foreign guests here for the 25th anniversary were taken by the Nicaraguan hosts night after night to performances of the Bolshoi Ballet. Fragments of 'Swan Lake' passed before the eyes of third world revolutionaries and rustic Sandinistas, whose sensibilities to the expression and synchronization of the dance are, to put it kindly, imperfectly developed. But Nicaraguans are getting used to all the Kremlin arts, both the arts of peace and those of war.'' Those of you who know our mission can probably figure out who wrote this. **********''For anyone who has been in Moscow's Red Square on Nov. 7, what happened here on that day and the next was redolent of similarities evoking those sounds and sights. In Moscow, the Nov. 7 parade was always worth very careful attention because it tended to reveal both what the leadership thought it most important to say about Soviet society as well as some aspects of its true nature. All of the things present in Moscow, or almost all, were to be found in Managua on the day of its parade, Nov. 8. Just as the Soviet Defense Minister begins the ceremonies by taking the salute of his troops standing in an open car, before returning to the top of the Lenin Mauseleum to join his colleagues for the march-past, so Umberto Ortega did the same in Managua to the recorded hurrahs of the troops. **********''Then the parade began with various Sandinista units marching in tight, perfectly formed squares, using the port arms tradition of the Soviet forces and the goosestep borrowed from the Prussians by the last czars for their household regiments, but in our time sharply odorous of Nazi parades. Then came armored - REPRESENTATIVE FASCELL: Is that a regular mission report to the Secretary of State? A. This is a special - **********Q. I think we got the drift, could we just -A. Well, let me just finish it because I think you've got to hear it. ''Then came armored personnel carriers, towed artillery and tanks. The only thing missing from the Soviet model were the intercontinental ballistic missiles -Q. Mr. Secretary. Mr. Secretary. **********A. - with the warheads painted red, which always bring up the end of a Moscow parade.'' **********Q. Mr. Secretary, I hate to interrupt you, but I'm constrained to ask you: How long is this report? **********A. I got one more paragraph. Q. Go ahead. A. ''The Nicaraguan troops are uniformed exactly like the Soviets. The marines look just in from the Baltic Fleet at Kronshtadt, the infantry formations could have been Soviet regiments, uniformed in sand-colored fatigues, for Afghanistan. The T-55 tank commanders in their leather helmets were directly out of a Soviet armored division, and the reservists carried in Soviet trucks, with their wide-beamed Soviet helmets, recalled the motorized rifle divisions one sees in the western military districts of the Soviet Union.'' **********So that's what's going on down there. **********REPRESENTATIVE HAMILTON: Mr. Secretary, we appreciate your appearance here today. As I understand your testimony at this point, you've said that you personally opposed the sale of arms to Iran and, secondly, you've said that you did not know of the diversion of any of the funds to the contras until it became public, or shortly there before. I have two things I'd like you to comment on. Mr. McFarlane has said publicly, ''I talked to the Secretary of State repeatedly and often of every item in the relationship with Iran.'' **********And secondly, I'd like you to clarify for me what the Administration believes the mistakes to have been. The President has said, ''I did not make a mistake,'' and then in his radio address the other day, he said mistakes were made. I think it's important for the Congress to understand how the Administration analyzed this event. Was the mistake in supplying arms to Iran? Was the mistake in diverting funds to the contra? Was the mistake in not informing the Congress? **********Just what is it that the President referred to when he said that mistakes were made? **********A. Well, very clearly it was a mistake to get involved in the illegal arms transfer - or funds transfer. Mistakes and the Law **********Q. To the contras? **********A. To the extent - I don't know the ins and outs of that, I don't want to act like a judge passing judgment on what happened. I don't have the facts. But from what I have seen and what the Attorney General said, some things took place that were illegal. And so that's clearly a mistake. I might say it's not only a mistake because it's illegal but it has - it has confused the situation insofar as our support for the Nicaraguan resistance is concerned. And unfairly to them, because they have no part in that. And so it's a mistake from that standpoint as well. **********I do not know in detail - in fact, I don't know much at all - about the arms transfers that apparently took place in the calendar year 1986. I know more about what took place during 1985, and I'm prepared in a closed session, based on documents that I have, cable traffic and notes that were taken at the time - and I don't claim that my notes encompass everything that I knew, but I've tried to stick in what I've prepared for a closed session to things that I could be pretty confident of. Recognizing that in these things, when you go into them and you are questioned and people remind you of this or that, it jogs your memory. **********But at any rate, I knew that arms transfers to Iran were periodically considered after June 1985 as part of an effort to improve relations with Iran and secure the release of our hostages. There was a lot - there was considerable discussion between Mr. McFarlane and I about that, and at least on one occasion that I distinctly recall, with the President. **********I learned not as a result of being involved in the development of the plan but, so to speak, as a plan was about to be implemented. I learned in various ways of two proposed transfers during 1985, but I was never informed and had the impression that they were not consummated. I later learned - heard - that one shipment had misfired, that is, it had been delivered but due to Iranian rejection of the arms involved, was not - not consummated. **********I knew that in December 1985, following a full-scale discussion of this matter with the President, that we instructed a mission that talked with the Iranians that were being - that were the interlocutors, or representing themselves as the interlocutors -they were told on instructions that we would engage the Iranians in a dialogue if they release our hostages but that we would not sell them arms. That was an explicit part of the instruction that the President had authorized. **********So there was, you might say, a period of time from more or less the middle of 1985 until this period following the December meeting in which there was a fair amount of discussion of the subject - and I expressed my views during that period - in which some things were apparently structured. I can't tell you exactly how, but which, so far as I could see, never came off. And at the end of this process, after a full discussion, wanting to see the dialogue with Iran continue but not - but having become convinced that there shouldn't be an arms transfer connected with it, the instructions that I referred to were the instructions of the mission. ... Meeting in January **********The subject was reviewed again by the President in a full-scale meeting in January of 1986. This was not a meeting in which an explicit decision was stated. People made arguments, I made my arguments. However, I could fairly conclude from the meeting that the point of view that I thought had prevailed in December was not - didn't seem to be prevailing. But it wasn't as though there was some sharp decision. **********I learned in November that a finding was made authorizing among other things arms sales, but I was not informed of that finding at the time so I can't tell you anything about the thinking that went into the finding as such. That came as a -Q. The finding was in January, Mr. Secretary. **********A. The finding was in January, and I was notified of it at about the same time you were notified of it. I did not learn about any transfers of arms during 1986 in a direct way. But, as is always the case, you have bits and pieces of evidence float in and so I weighed in on the basis of that, restating my views. What I heard was conflicting: at times that there was some sort of deal or signal in the words, and at other times that the operation was closed down. And, in fact, the word used at one time with me was that the people involved had been told to stand down. President's Plan **********So, again, there was this ambiguity from my standpoint. I would say to you that I did take the position in part because of all the problems that we have with leaks, and recognizing that if the President's initiative had any chance of success it would have to be a secret initiative for all the reasons that have been developed - perfectly good reasons. That whenever I would be called upon to do something to carry out those policies, I needed to know, but I didn't need to know things that were not in my sphere to do something about. **********Now this past weekend, our Ambassador in Beirut, Mr. John Kelly, responded to an all-posts directive that we put out. We put out a directive from the State Department - I don't have the date of it but shortly after this investigation started - telling our posts to discover anything that they had about this, to secure it and to make it available here in Washington. So I got a response from Mr. John Kelly and I will read his response: **********''I met in Washington in July or August 1986 with Robert McFarlane, who briefed me on the hostage negotiations involving arms to Iran as an inducement. Between the dates of Oct. 30 and Nov. 4, 1986, I had numerous conversations with Lieut. Col. Oliver North and Richard V. Secord, relating to the hostage negotiations with Iran. During that period, I received and sent numerous 'back channel' messages to and from the White House, Admiral Poindexter, concerning the hostage negotiations. Those messages were transmitted and received in what is referred to as the 'privacy channel,' using C.I.A. communications facilities. **********''In accordance with our standard practice at Embassy Beirut'' -which they have to do, given the situation there - ''all of that message traffic was destroyed thereafter, at my direction.'' That is a standing order in a post like Beirut; nothing wrong with that. ''I would assume that copies may be available at C.I.A. headquarters or at the White House situation room. With regard to my conversations with McFarlane, North and Secord, I stand ready to discuss them with appropriate officials upon the Department's direction.'' Records of Activities **********I have instructed Ambassador Kelly to return to Washington immediately, bringing with him all records of such activities, to be available to the F.B.I. and other appropriate investigative bodies. I am, to put it mildly, shocked to learn this, after the event, from an ambassador, but at any rate, I'm just reading you this report. **********Throughout the entire period, I opposed the transfer of arms to Iran until Iran stopped the war in the gulf, ended its support for terrorism and obtained the release of the hostages. Throughout the entire period, I fully agreed with the President's objective of finding a way to modify Iran's behavior in a manner consistent with our strategic interests, and those of our friends in the region and around the world. **********The President has confirmed publicly that he believed in principle, in the light of all the circumstances, that we should use a limited amount of arms to send a signal. There are legitimate arguments to be made in favor of this decision and the President has made them. And I fully accept their legitimacy, and the legitimacy and propriety of the President's decision, and right to make that decision, and support that. **********It's difficult for me to talk about particular incidents without violating security requirements, to give you a full accounting - which, as I've said, I'm perfectly prepared to do. But it must be done in a way that is proper. But I believe a review of the classified record, if you go through it with me, will support the statements that I have made. And it will also show that my knowledge of what took place was sporadic and fragmentary, and materially incomplete. So I'm not the witness to tell you all of the things that took place because I'm not informed. **********Insofar as any question - I'm repeating, but I want to repeat - any question of diversion of funds to support the Nicaraguan democratic resistance, my knowledge was not fragmentary, it was nonexistent. ... **********REPRESENTATIVE YATRON: Mr. Secretary, did the Inter-American Affairs Bureau at State have any knowledge of, or was it involved in the coordination of, funds for the contras from the Iran arms sales? A. No.  Q. Was the Bureau aware of any -A. Let me say, not to their knowledge. If there were some funds put somewhere, that were useful, then they were trying to provide, properly, humanitarian aid when that was authorized. And, since the $100 million authorized, they've been involved in that. And there is an explicit Congressional mandate for the State Department to play a strong role in that, and we're trying to do that. But nobody in our bureau, that I know of - and I'm certain Elliott Abrams and his group had no knowledge of this Iranian funds transfer question at all. Zero. Boland Amendment **********Q. Well, was the bureau aware of the method by which the contras were receiving lethal aid during the period in which the Boland Amendment was in effect? **********A. We are - we don't presume to know everything that a person may do somewhere in the Government. It was clear that - from private sources, presumably - some aid was flowing to the people fighting for freedom and independence in Nicaragua. And personally, I applaud that. There's a lot of aid flowing from America to the Nicaraguan Communists, quite a few Americans down there. That's their right to be. And it shouldn't be surprising that there are Americans who want to help the people fighting for freedom. **********Q. To what extent do intelligence operatives from other agencies apprise the bureau of their activities with respect to coordinating funding for contra operations, and does the Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs receive such reports? **********A. He does, and he chairs the inter-agency group that includes people from all of the agencies involved whose task it is to evaluate what is going on and to make recommendations, if needed, for new legislation or what our policy should be, and to oversee the tactics involved. 2d ADD SUB CAPITAL TEXT xxx the tactics involved. Intelligence Reports **********Q. One final question. From the management standpoint, are you apprised on a regular basis of the department's involvement in contra operations by Assistant Secretary Abrams, and do these reports include summaries of the intelligence community's operations? **********A. Well, I see reports from time to time. I see Elliott Abrams frequently. And so I try to keep abreast of what is going on, as best I can. I have lots of things to keep abreast of, but I do try to stay informed and, of course, most importantly, to see that the people involved are strong, capable people. And I put Mr. Abrams down as one who knows what he's doing. ... **********REPRESENTATIVE GILMAN: Can you tell us whether you were under any constraint, or whether the department was under any constraint, not to reveal any of the information with regard to the Iranian arms sales? **********A. No. We were, of course, bound by the decisions that would be made about something that was to be held in confidence. But as far as our measuring up to our responsibilities were concerned, we were engaged, you might say, in an argument about what should be done. And there were these incidents that came along that I have pointed up for you, without being in a position to - for various reasons; partly lack of knowledge, partly because of the nature of the open hearing here - to give you full information about them. **********Q. But once the project was under way, didn't you feel that the department had a necessity of consulting with the Congress with regard to these initiatives? **********A. Well, I don't feel that we should sort of bring all our internal debates to the Congress, particularly on something like this. Of course, policy toward Iran, policy toward terrorism, all of these basic things that have been laid out, we have discussed here in the committee many times. Consulting Congress **********Q. But I'm not talking about debate, Mr. Secretary, I'm talking about the actual operation that was under way. Once that was under way and some of that was brought to the department's attention, wasn't there then a responsibility to the department to consult with Congress? **********A. Well, perhaps so. I don't - I'm not here to claim that my actions in all of this were all that they should be. You'll have to judge that for yourself. And I can tell you what I knew and what I didn't. **********Q. Just one other question, Mr. Secretary. You mention Ambassador Kelly's report to the C.I.A. but a failure to report to your office. Is that an unusual or a unique situation, or something that's in violation of any of the State Department's regulations? **********A. I hope it's unique. Ambassadors - there is supposed to be, I say supposed to be - a chain of command that goes from the President, to me -not to the N.S.C., to me - and through the Assistant Secretary, by and large, to the ambassador. That's the chain of command. President's Authority **********Q. And was that a violation, sir? **********A. And if something comes up that causes an ambassador to go outside the chain of command, there needs to be a good reason. Now it may be very well that Ambassador Kelly will say that he was told on the authority of the President that he was supposed to do this and that. And I would think that he would have checked with me to see if that were so. **********Q. Who would enable such an ambassador to waive that responsibility? **********A. At this point, all I can tell you is the cable that I got. I don't consider it a satisfactory situation. **********I do have to - I think we should recognize, however, what life is like in Washington. Now, come on, here we are. And who was it? The Canadian Ambassador coined the phrase, ''It's never over.'' Nothing ever gets settled in this town. It's not like running a company, or even a university. It's - it's a seething debating society in which the debate never stops, in which people never give up, including me. And so that's the atmosphere in which you administer. And what I try to do is stay as close to the President as I can, and I feel very close to him. And I admire and respect him tremendously. I think he has transformed the situation, done a marvelous job. And I try to stay very close to him and I support his policies. **********I don't win every argument, by a long shot, but I am in the argument. And when the President decides something, then I do my best to make it work. ... **********REPRESENTATIVE SOLARZ: Mr. Secretary, for six years the Administration has said it would never yield to the demands of terrorists, pay ransom for hostages, or sell arms to states that sponsor and support terrorism. It now turns out that we've done all three. How could this have happened? How much damage has it done to our credibility, and what assurance can you give us that it won't happen again? **********A. Well, the President decided to give a signal. I'm just quoting the President here, and he's made a public statement of what he authorized and why. And he has acknowledged that in doing so he recognized that there were risks as well as potential benefits, and he had to weigh that. And right now, because of the way this has blown up, the emphasis is all on the risks. I dare say that if somehow we had our hostages all returned, and we saw a different kind of situation in one way or another emerging in Iran, and this came out, people would say, well, the President showed guts. He took a risk and he knew that if it didn't work out he would get panned but he did it for a good purpose. ... On $2 Million Fund **********Q. Mr. Secretary, just one other question on this point. Were you consulted or informed about the request of Lieutenant Colonel North to Ross Perot to pay $2 million in ransom money for the release of our hostages? And is it conceivable to you that Lieutenant Colonel North would have made such a request without the approval of the President or some higher authority? **********A. I was not informed. And, so far as I know, the President wasn't informed. But I have no knowledge about Lieutenant Colonel's activities in this regard. I think the offer of Mr. Perot, if that is what took place - I don't know, I just read about it - I think it's outrageous. ... **********REPRESENTATIVE LEACH: Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, you come before us as a man of very great integrity. You've been a good soldier even when I think many of us considered Administration policies very, very wrong. In the past when those of us have differed with you, the issues have entirely been those of judgment and policy. It appears today we have a political crisis that's become a Constitutional confrontation. **********A. I don't believe it's a Constitutional confrontation at all. What the President has done is - is move out people who seem to be involved, he has put in a new and outstanding National Security Council director, he has appointed - or asked for the appointment of a special prosecutor. He has said that he will make available to the Congress, and instructed me to come here and talk to you. Where is the Constitutional crisis? There is no Constitutional crisis. 3d & LAST ADD SUB CAPITAL TEXT x x x ''no Constitutional crisis.'' **********I can assure this committee that the effort to deal with the present Iranian matter that we're discussing here today is going to have nothing to do with decisions about arms control or other activities. Those have to stand on their feet. And what I was trying to do in my opening statement - and I believe in doing so I was following what both the chairman and ranking member were recommending - is to say that, in addition to doing the investigation the important thing is to get on with the business, and to let the people who are supposed to do the investigating investigate. **********But let's not get it put in the center of all activity so that we're paralyzed. We are not paralyzed, we are working hard on all of these issues and including the issues of arms control. There, at least in my judgment, we're finally getting up and on the table at least the numbers of dramatic reductions in intermediate-range missiles on an equal basis. . . . ... On Funds' Diversion **********REPRESENTATIVE BONKER: . . . Now as the Cabinet officer who is responsible for the conduct of this nation's foreign policy, if you are telling us this morning - and I believe all of us feel you're stating the truth - that your role was zero, or nonexistent, then how is it - A. My role was nonexistent insofar as the apparent reported use of funds generated by sales of arms to Iran and the diversion of those funds to help the Nicaraguan resistance. I knew nothing about that. I did not say that I knew nothing about any of the other things. On the contrary, I tried to tell you what I knew about it. **********Q. I appreciate that clarification. But nonetheless, many of these activities were directly contrary to stated policies of our Government. My question is, how is it possible for this duplicitous activity to go on? In other words, how is it possible that another agency, aside from the State Department, is engaged in activity, or operations, that are contrary to the official policy of the United States? Shouldn't the State Department assert its natural, Constitutional, proper role over the conduct of the foreign policy so we don't end up with contradictory policies that possibly confuse not only our allies but people here in America? **********A. First of all, the President made a public statement explaining his reasoning for sending a signal. A signal involving arms transfers that you have characterized in various ways and which have been widely characterized as such. There is a whole other side to that argument which the President presented, explaining to the American people and to you why he decided to send that signal. Knowing full well the risks involved but seeking an objective that, if it could be achieved I'm sure everybody would applaud. So that's the decision that the President made, legitimately. **********Now insofar as the State Department is concerned, I believe it is correct to say that we do not have a foreign policy in the State Department. The President has a foreign policy. I work for the President and we are engaged in a process - and I am by directive and by common understanding and, I hope, by my association with the President - principal foreign policy adviser to him. But it is the President's policy . . . **********Now, I believe that the conduct, the operational conduct of diplomatic activity, should be lodged in the State Department. And by and large it is. And if there is a lesson out of all this, insofar as how things operate are concerned, I think the lesson is that the - that operational activities, and a staff for conducting operational activities out of the National Security Council staff, is very questionable and shouldn't be done except in very are circumstances. The example is given of Henry Kissinger's diplomacy with China and, of course, that was spectacular. Everybody refers to it and it was a wonderful thing. On the other hand, to the extent that it causes other people to aspire to be Henry Kissingers, it can get you into trouble. There's only one, they broke the mold when they made him. ... Robert C. McFarlane **********REPRESENTATIVE FASCELL: . . . We're happy to welcome Mr. Robert McFarlane, who served with great distinction as a former assistant to the President in national security affairs, and after he left office, undertook at the President's request a secret mission to Iran. And so we'd like to hear from him a full explanation of his role in the Iranian initiative in the sale of arms to Iran, what part he played, if any, in the diversion of funds from the arms sales to the Nicaraguan contras, and who in the White House and in the Administration he kept informed about all of these matters. ... Central Points **********Mr. McFARLANE: I would like in short narrative compression to make what I believe are its two central points, and they are these: that the questions at issue regarding U. S. initiatives toward Iran - which is the only issue on which I have first-hand knowledge - the questions are was it sensible to try to make contact with elements appearing to want change in Iranian policy; people against terrorism, against the war, and conscious of the state of decline in their own country. And secondly, if it was sensible, was it feasible? Are there really such elements? If so, how can you identify them and how ought one proceed. ... **********There are many, many reasons why any prudent Iranian official, looking at the conditions his country faces beyond as well as the more tangible pressures he sees from his own people each day, to want to change. And these conditions were very apparent to the President and to others in the Administration for a long time. But it wasn't until the summer of last year that elements that fit that description surfaced and we became aware that elements that were both in the Government and close to it, as advisers, wanted to know whether the United States had any interest in such a discourse. **********The President considered the matter in his original proposal. There was no direct linkage made at all between arms and the relationship. And only over time - but soon, within a month or so - it became clear that while a political agenda was proposed and accepted by our side, that the elements making the proposal from within Iran, high officials, made clear that for them to be able to sustain that dialogue and, over time, exert any influence to change policy within Iran, they would need to strengthen themselves. And in their terms, this would require them to reach out to elements within the military, the revolutionary guards or both, and that the currency of that undertaking was arms. **********Now I think this is probably the most difficult - understandably difficult - issue to understand, for anybody in our country. It is not in our tradition. And yet, when one looks at countries in the Middle East, whether in Lebanon or elsewhere, you find that historically - particularly in the recent past - the course to power, to governance, by leaders both of the right and left, have been first to establish a power base, to build a coalition, and that that process without exception has required the appeal to those elements through weapons and arms. Indeed, very unlike our own system, it is the rule, not the exception, in the Middle East. **********The President acknowledged, faced with this opportunity, that any element within Iran who truly were committed to change and reform were certainly going to be very vulnerable. And he acknowledged that the transfer, indirectly, of weapons to support these individuals and allow them to build a constituency would indeed not be a violation of policy but, to the extent that it dealt with people who opposed Iranian policy, oppose terrorism, that modest levels which could not affect the balance in the war with Iraq, nor could be applied to terrorist undertakings, would be central. **********President's Concern . . . I want to stress that throughout, from the outset last July in 1985, to the time I left Government in December of 1985, it was very clear that the President of the United States was motivated by two concerns. And that was the imperative of trying, if it were possible, to establish contact with those oriented toward changing Iranian policy, and secondly, toward the recovery of Americans and other nationals held hostage. **********The President was profoundly concerned for the welfare of these human beings. At no time, in my experience, nor since leaving government, can I imagine that the President would ever countenance nor endorse any departure from law nor of policies in promotion of U. S. interests against terrorism. Thank you, sir. ... **********REPRESENTATIVE LANTOS: Mr. McFarlane, actions in the real world are judged by their consequences and not the motivations that might lie behind them. This policy, it seems to me, was doomed from the outset because what you were looking for was the political equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. What you were looking for was the attainment of goals without destroying the policy of anti-terrorism, relations with allies, relations with moderate Arab countries, relations with the Congress. And the two simply could not be fitted together. **********Earlier today, the Secretary said -and the President said and Mr. Bush said - that there have been some mistakes in the execution of the policy but there is nothing wrong with the policy. Well, I suggest the policy is an example of mind-boggling myopia, of staggering stupidity. My simple question to you is, give me the scenario that would have made this policy not destroy all the other objectives I touched on. ... **********A. I would certainly agree with your implication that we do not identify, cannot identify with the purposes nor brutality of the Iranian regime that came to power seven years ago. We do aspire to hoping that perhaps one day elements within Iran will see it in their interests to change. But we're not naive. It was important that when reports came to us that there were such elements that we try, as we did, successfully, to validate those bona fides -and the specific concrete evidence of that I'll be glad to treat in a closed session. ... Reagan Authorization **********REPRESENTATIVE BERMAN: Your statement is just being passed out at this time and I don't think many of us had a chance to review it specifically. But I'd like to ask you a couple of questions based on some reporting by Bernard Gwertzman of The New York Times late last week. He indicated in his article that according to your - that President Reagan in fact gave you a general authorization to proceed with the authorizing the sale or the resale of arms to the Iranians as early as the fall of 1985. Is that correct? **********A. I don't know the text of what you're referring to. But in sum, to say that the President authorized of the indirect delivery of small levels of arms to Iran for the purpose of strengthening elements that were against terrorism, and that was communicated ultimately to the Iranian authorities and that in the conduct of that, that certain transfers occurred which were reviewed again in December of last year. **********Q. When did that authorization occur? **********A. In August of 1985."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/world/the-talk-of-lagos-in-chaotic-nigeria-bread-and-roadblocks-endure.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1986-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1283, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN CHAOTIC NIGERIA, BREAD AND ROADBLOCKS ENDURE", "print_headline": "THE TALK OF LAGOS; IN CHAOTIC NIGERIA, BREAD AND ROADBLOCKS ENDURE", "body_text": " **********Toward evening, just before the day's heat begins its reluctant nocturnal retreat, the bread ladies come out. **********Along four-lane paved boulevards, at bus depots squeezed onto patches of hard-packed mouse-brown dirt and among squatting cassava and yam sellers at little markets, the bread ladies, like a ships gracefully slicing through churning water, glide along with golden brown loaves of bread stacked on their heads like so many blocks of wood. **********They are a welcome sight here, reassuring signs that despite economic woes and political maelstroms, there is still something that endures, the certainty of bread. **********That constancy shuddered a bit recently with a surge in bread prices that seemed to augur the beginnings of a nationwide bread shortage. Prices began their spurt soon after Flour Mills of Nigeria Ltd., the main flour mill in the country, announced it was shutting down for three weeks because it could not import wheat. **********Prices Doubled and Tripled **********Flour prices doubled and tripled overnight as bakers frantically tried to buy what was left of a suddenly dwindling supply. Officially, a 110-pound sack of flour should sell for about $22. But flour merchants were seen hawking bags at anywhere from $62 to $80. **********''If this state of affairs continues, there will be no bread anywhere,'' said J. O. Elijah, the marketing manager of Defacto Bakeries. **********Even before the price of flour began its ascent, the bread ladies were raising their prices so that the smallest loaf, which used to cost 30 cents, is now is selling for 40 cents. The largest loaves, almost as big as a box of Saltines, shot up to $2, from about $1. **********A bread lady swayed down Keffi Street on Ikoyi Island and stopped in front of a whitewashed cement chamber large enough to hold the Xerox machine inside, where documents can be copied for 30 cents. The lady stopped to sell a loaf at the new price. **********The copy man seemed to sigh a bit. ''Nothing to do,'' he said. Roadblocks, a bane for motorists in Lagos and a headache for the Government, have been sprouting and wilting like dandelions doused in a weak herbicide. **********Throughout the city, especially at night, there are groups of policemen, many with automatic pistols or Belgian-made automatic rifles slung over their shoulders, positioned next to battered oil drums blocking all but one lane of traffic. **********As cars push slowly ahead, a police officer looks at the occupants of each car and then, sullenly, usually waves it on. Private cars tend to pass roadblocks quickly, but taxis and the little vans packed with passengers are often pulled aside and questions are asked, papers scrutinized and bundles examined. **********''They want a little something,'' said a Lagos resident of the police. He said the roadblocks were a fact of life as long as the police were underpaid. **********Outside the city, on the main roads heading east, the roadblocks increase, manned here by policemen, there by soldiers. In some cases both policemen and soldiers are at the same collection of oil drums and stacked tires, searching vehicles. **********A short while ago, the Government issued harsh instructions ordering the dismantlement of roadblocks. For a time, traffic picked up and cars whizzed around the city unmolested. **********Then, three lanes of traffic ground to a halt on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway in Ikeja, a northern section of the city. Squeezing into one lane, traffic crawled forward toward a cluster of policemen who were pulling cars over, opening trunks and looking at identity papers. ''Why are you doing this?'' a sergeant was asked. **********''We ask the questions,'' he said, before waving the gray Peugot on. **********Although now part of a buried past, the leader of what used to be Biafra won a territorial skirmish with the Lagos state government recently. **********The leader, Chief Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, who as a lieutenant colonel led the Ibo people of eastern Nigeria into a fierce secessionist war in 1967, has successfully battled his way through the courts and into his old house on Queens Drive, on Ikoyi Island here, one of the city's toniest residential areas. **********As Biafran troops were finally being crushed in the east, Chief Ojukwu, by then a general, fled to London, where he remained until Nigeria returned to civilian rule in 1979. After the war's end, the Government had enacted legislation designed to restore former property to Biafrans who had fled the north and west of Nigeria. Chief Ojukwu's house dispute is one of the final legacies of that law. **********In November 1984, after he and other Nigerians were released by the former military Government, Chief Ojukwu moved into his Queens Drive house, grandly called Villaska Lodge, a two-story white edifice with a red-tile roof and hemmed in by a solid stone wall. The Lagos state government, after some time, decided that the lodge belonged not to Chief Ojukwu at all, but a company owned by the chief's father. **********Last October, with the help of 100 policemen, 50 armed soldiers and several dump trucks, Chief Ojukwu's household belongings were hauled away and the doors padlocked. Undaunted, the chief pitched tent outside the house, began a hunger strike and took up legal cudgels. **********In January, the courts gave in to Chief Ojukwu's legal onslaught; the Lagos state government retreated, and he moved back behind the white walls. **********Outside, a wooden sign still reads, ''Beware of snakes.'' **********Nigeria's military Government, which took power in a coup in August, has, in a rather pointed departure from the practices of its predecessors, given the country's press free reign. **********Intoxicated by the sudden liberty, the country's newspapers and magazines emerged with fists windmilling, publishing impassioned editorials and showing a noticeably reduced reverence for official authority. Headlines scream of corruption in high places, favoritism and incompetence by Government officials. The press was feeling good. But on Feb. 6, official tolerance seemed to reach its limit. **********Six editors of the influential weekly magazine Newswatch were hauled into court by Judge Samson Uwaifo. Judge Uwaifo, the head of a special tribunal that had just ruled that Nigeria's last civilian President, Shehu Shagari, was not guilty of corruption charges and should be released from detention, was angered by Newswatch's editorial reaction. **********''The whole thing was a farce, inelegantly contrived much in the manner of a kangaroo court rendered even more kangarooic - permit the coinage - by the abject naivete of the presiding judge,'' wrote Ray Ekpu, Newswatch's deputy editor in chief. **********When Mr. Ekpu and his colleagues appeared before him, Judge Uwaifu lashed out, declaring that Mr. Ekpu's editorial was a calculated attempt to destroy the very basis of the tribunal. **********Turning to Mr. Ekpu specifically, the judge said: ''If you have enemies to fight, you don't look to this panel. If you want to destroy them, you pray for thunder or rainstorm and that may help you to strike them down.'' **********Judge Uwaifu then fined Mr. Ekpu $20. **********Newswatch said it would appeal. The president of the National Union of Journalists, George Uzobo, ordered a boycott of all tribunals by reporters for a week. **********For his part, Mr. Ekpu said he was undeterred.

Shafts Are Started **********Napoleon strongly backed a plan in 1802 for two 10-mile tunnels meeting in an artifical island on a mid-Channel sandbank. The tunnels would carry mail, be lighted with oil lamps and be ventilated by pipes sticking up above the sea. **********In the 1870's British and French companies were founded to build a tunnel along plans drawn up by another French engineer, Thome de Gamond.

Such fears were to dominate British thinking for over half a century.

''We've shown that we've had major increases in the cost of claims. Regulating our rates won't change those costs. Tort reform was the problem, and tort reform continues to be the problem.'' Curbs Are Criticized **********Mr. Barnert argued that most of the proposed restrictions on insurers would actually be counterproductive. **********''The proposed prohibition on cancellations in the middle of a term, for example, won't solve the availability problem,'' he said. ''If anything, it will make insurance less available because insurers will have to be even more careful about who they insure. The way to make more insurance available is not by having the industry file its rates with the state, but by making the market more stable, and that means getting rid of the excesses in the legal system.'' **********Larry Kibbee, assistant vice president at Utica National Insurance Group, agreed. ''More regulation just makes companies more selective about who they will insure,'' said Mr. Kibbee, whose company once insured more than 200 New York municipalities but has not renewed those policies over the last year. **********Mr. Kibbee said that without the $250,000 cap, he doubted that his company would issue such policies again. **********The American Insurance Association, a trade group for 171 property and casualty insurance companies around the nation, also objected to some of the Cuomo proposals. Lawrence M. Zippin, the group's executive vice president, said the proposals to create a joint underwriting association, enlarge the State Insurance Fund's authority and establish an insurance consumer advocate ''could have a negative impact on the availability of insurance in the state.'' 'All or Nothing' **********In a statement, Utica National said the recommendations were ''encouraging only if they are adopted in total and as long as the legislators who will consider a package of legislation based on the report approach the tort reform measures with the same fervor with which they approach insurance regulation.'' **********''It's all or nothing at this point,'' Mr. Kibbee said.  Mr. Barnert said he was unhappy that the commission did not discuss the contingency-fee system, under which lawyers who take personal injury cases get paid a percentage of whatever they recover for their clients: ''That's a fundamental part of the problem; lawyers won't settle if they have this incentive to go for the million-dollar verdict.'' **********Lawyers who represent the victims in such cases, meanwhile, argued that it was the insurance industry's practices, and not the legal system, that needed changing. **********''I am very happy with the recommendations that deal with the insurace industry, but I do not like the parts on the tort system,'' said Fred Queller, president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association. ''If it's not going to help the insurance problem, why should we cut off the victims' rights to full compensation for injuries that destroy their lives?'' Opponents of Cap **********Mr. Queller and others, however, were jubilant that Governor Cuomo had rejected the $250,000 cap. **********''I was delighted that he didn't go with the cap,'' said Paul Rheingold, a New York personal injury lawyer. ''Fear of the cap is 99 percent of why I wake up in the middle of night. We're having a cascade of caps in other states, and it really isn't fair to victims. Even a million dollars is not anywhere near enough to compensate someone who's lost his arms or legs.'' **********Recently, both Maryland and Washington have adopted caps on pain and suffering awards. **********For many personal injury lawyers, the most upsetting part of the proposals was the recommendation that a given party be responsible only for its share of the damages in a liability case involving several parties. **********''I think it's completely unfair to the victims,'' Mr. Rheingold said. ''If a driver with a $10,000 insurance policy has an accident and injures someone, and 1 percent of the fault lies with the city because of a pothole, that accident victim is going to take it on the chin. Under the new proposal, he'd only be able to collect the $10,000 from the driver plus 1 percent of the damages from the city, and as a practical matter, that's not going to compensate him for his injury.'' **********Besides opposing the liability recommendation, Mr. Queller objected to other provisions in Mr. Cuomo's proposal, including the move to pay victims their money over a period of years rather than in a lump sum and to impose sanctions on lawyers who bring frivolous suits. **********Mr. Rheingold and some other lawyers, however, said they did not object to the proposals on lump sum payments and frivolous lawsuits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/17/world/palestinians-in-protest-at-west-bank-school.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Palestinians in Protest At West Bank School", "print_headline": "Palestinians in Protest At West Bank School", "body_text": " **********Palestinian students threw stones and blocked roads with burning tires today as Al Najah University in Nablus opened its doors after being shut down for a week by the Israeli authorities, the Israeli radio said. **********Israeli forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to control crowds of students and keep them away from the main road, a military spokesman said. **********The Israeli radio said the soldiers maintained a distance from the protesting students, and a military spokesman said the soldiers ''operated with restraint.'' **********The protests today followed several days of relative quiet after more than a week of Palestinian demonstrations sparked by the army's killing of two students in a protest at Bir Zeit University on Dec. 4."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/business/briefs-305986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Continental Bancorp Inc., Philadelphia, said its shareholders had approved the merger of Continental into Midlantic Banks Inc. of Edison, N.J. *********** Doxsee Food Corp., Baltimore, said it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Borden Inc. for $10.75 a share, or about $32.5 million. *********** GATX Corp., Chicago, said it had repurchased four million shares, or 30.8 percent, of its common stock for $38 a share in cash and notes, or about $150 million. *********** Pillsbury Co., Minneapolis, said it had acquired Buiscuitbrie Vinchon-Jeanette and Biscuitbrie Minimax & N.V.

Aquino Jr., the opposition leader whose death began the chain of events that drove Ferdinand E. Marcos into exile last week. **********The original trial that ended in aquittals for 26 defendants was denounced by the Marcos Government's chief prosecutor as so stage-managed by Mr. Marcos that a new trial would not risk double jeopardy. **********The prosecutor, Manuel Herrerra, disclosed that Mr. Marcos had gathered the judges and prosecutors in a private meeting and instructed them: ''Let's do some play-acting.'' **********''There was already a decision even before the start of the trial,'' Mr. Herrera said. ''The nullification of the trial is proper,'' he declared in a statement in which he said there were ''clear indications of failure of justice.'' **********Plea by President's Secretary **********The most significant call for a new inquiry was voiced by Joker Arroyo, the exective secretary to President Corozon C. Aquino, the widow of Mr. Aquino, and considers him the ''No. 1 suspect'' in her husband's murder. **********''It is important to reopen the case,'' said Mr. Arroyo, a human-rights lawyer with a reputation for fighting the Marcos Government.

He said he would report to the commission and expected a new investigation. Absent From Closing Sessions **********Mr. Herrera was clearly viewed as a man under pressure during the trial last year. His statement characterized the trial as akin to a movie scenario for which he ''already knew the ending.'' **********''That's why he decided to step out of the movie house,'' Mr. Herrara's statement asserted, referring to his absences from the closing sessions. **********Mr. Herrera's recollections were disputed somewhat by his superior in the Marcos Government, the ombudsman Bernardo Fernandez. He conceded he faced pressures from Mr. Marcos, but added: ''I can honestly say I didn't do anything that I should be ashamed of.'' **********He said Mr. Marcos did not have to engage in direct pressure. ''He had a way of making you feel what he wanted you to do,'' he said. #26 Defendants Involved The murder trial occurred after a special investigation panel concluded that the shooting was not the work of a lone Communist agent, as the Marcos Government contended, but was a military conspiracy directed by ranking officers in the Presidential palace. **********The trial involved one civilian defendant and 25 military men, including Mr. Marcos's principal aide, Gen. Fabian C. Ver, former chief of staff of the armed forces, who fled the country with Mr. Marcos. **********A three-judge panel eventually agreed with the Marcos Government's version of the shooting and found none of the 26 defendants guilty. The ruling was widely disputed and unpopular. **********Mrs. Aquino's main goal lately for Mr. Marcos is to keep him away from the Philippines during her current attempts to stabilize the country. Her aides have indicated that any reopening of the inquiry would likely not include plans to force his return home. Judicial Resignations Accepted **********On other matters, Mr. Arroyo indicated that the Aquino Government was meeting success in the call for the resignation of the nation's ranking judges appointed by Mr. Marcos. Critics had long contended Mr. Marcos exercised despotic control of the courts through the appointment process. **********Mr. Arroyo said President Aquino might begin her promised reformation of the judicary within a few days, since various resignations had come from the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals. **********Asked about the state of the Communist insurgency now that Mrs. Aquino had released ranking Communists jailed by Mr. Marcos, Mr. Arroyo said, ''There is no real fighting.'' **********''There is relative peace even without a cease-fire,'' he said at a news conference. He said the release of the Communists, which caused some dissent in military circles, was ''an indication that both civil government and its military component have a healthy working relationship.'' **********''We start with a clean slate,'' Mr. Arroyo declared. ''All who fought Marcos are entitled to be released.'' **********The Defense Minister, Juan Ponce Enrile, the Marcos official who defected to Mrs. Aquino's side, was openly critical today of her decision to promote her chief military aide, Adelberto Yap, to colonel. Mr. Enrile, in a remark considered indicative of continuing divisions within the military, said the promotion of Colonel Yap, a well-known critic of Mr. Marcos, had prejudiced 34 other colonels senior to him in the air force.

The Administration proposed that the leaders meet here late in May or early in June, but no agreement was reached, and talks were broken off after the attacks this spring on Libya by United States warplanes. **********White House officials are now hoping for a meeting late in November or early in December. **********Mr. Reagan appeared to go out of his way during the news conference, his first in more than a month, to suggest he was hopeful that Mr. Gorbachev was ready to do business. He described him as ''the first Soviet leader to my knowledge that has ever voluntarily spoken of reducing nuclear weapons.'' Tourism and Terrorism **********On another topic, Mr. Reagan said that while he did not want to put himself in the position of encouraging Americans to travel abroad in a world beset by terrorism, he did not disagree with the statement on Charles Price, the United States Ambassador in Britain, that London was one of the safest places in the world. The British and other Europeans are appealing to Americans to reinstate European vacation plans canceled after the raids on Libya and other terrorist crises. **********Mr. Reagan, asked about his policy toward the 1979 treaty on strategic arms, said the United States could not go on observing its terms while the Soviet Union disregarded them. **********''The Soviet regime for seven years has been violating the restraints of the treaty,'' he said. ''We could not go on unilaterally observing the constraints while the Soviet Union violated them and gained even greater superiority over us.'' 'Legitimizing' Arms Race **********He said the treaty was ''nothing but the legitimizing of an arms race,'' and he noted that the United States had never ratified it. **********The treaty, he said, did not reduce arms stockpiles, but only regulated how fast the superpowers could increase the numbers of their weapons. **********Asked whether the United States would go over the treaty's limits or whether it would dismantle another submarine, the President said ''we've got several months to see'' what the Russians do and whether they join in arms-reduction programs. **********Asked about the new Soviet proposal on long-range missiles, the President said he could not comment because of the need for confidentiality in the situation, but he confirmed that the proposal had been received and said the United States would now study it. Presses Aid for Contras **********Asked what means the United States had to stop Nicaragua from becoming another Cuba, the President said he would not comment except to say that there should be aid to the rebels, who are sometimes called contras but whom he called ''freedom fighters.'' He said contras was a term used by the Nicaraguan Government, and ''I don't like to do anything they're doing.'' **********Asked why he lumped together Yasir Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and Mr. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, in a speech this week, he said that had been a misunderstanding. He repeated that he never meant to put Mr. Gorbachev in the same category as the others, because he was the first Soviet leader to say he was for reduction of nuclear weapons. **********Asked about a Warsaw Pact proposal for withdrawal of half a million troops on each side in Europe by the 1990's, Mr. Reagan, gave an answer that apparently referred to a separate Soviet proposal on strategic arms. He said that the Soviet side had made offers and that the United States had made counteroffers, but that the difficulty lay in the fact that the two sides had different mixes of weapons. Types of Weapons Differ **********He said Soviet weapons have more of an offensive character, while American weapons are based more on the deterrent idea. These differences, he added, ''have kept us from having agreements so far.'' **********He said the latest Soviet offer, made today, was ''in response to one of our counteroffers.'' **********''You can depend on it,'' he said. ''We will make every effort.'' But he stressed that any agreement had to be ''fair and balanced.'' **********Mr. Reagan was also asked whether he was concerned that Mexico might default on its foreign debt. **********''This is a possibility,'' he said, not only for Mexico, but also for other nations with heavy debt burdens. ''Obviously we'd like to be of help to them,'' he said, referring to the Mexicans. ''Our fortunes are linked on many fronts.'' **********Mr. Reagan said Paul A. Volcker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, visited Mexico this week for consultations because ''we want to be of as much help as we can.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/26/business/kohlberg-bid-seen-on-safeway.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1986-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 616, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KOHLBERG BID SEEN ON SAFEWAY", "print_headline": "KOHLBERG BID SEEN ON SAFEWAY", "body_text": " **********The Bankers Trust Company, one of the nation's biggest banks, is lining up a multibillion-dollar loan among other banks to finance a client's takeover of Safeway Stores, banking sources dislosed yesterday. **********The sources said Bankers Trust's client was Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company of New York, a leader in corporate leveraged buyouts. **********George Fasel, a spokesman for the bank, said that Bankers Trust did not comment on its customers' business. Henry Kravis, a Kohlberg, Kravis partner who acts as its spokesman, did not return phone calls. **********Meanwhile, Safeway's directors met yesterday to consider an offer from Kohlberg, Kravis to head a takeover of the company in a leveraged buyout, sources said. Safeway had identified the potential buyer earlier simply as a ''third party'' **********Safeway is expected to have an announcement on Sunday, sources close to the company said last night. Management Generally Stays **********Leveraged buyouts generally call for the company's top management to remain in command and for the loans to be paid off out of the company's own operating cash flow or by the sale of assets. **********Just last Monday, Herbert H. Haft, chairman of the Dart Group Corporation, wrote to Safeway's chairman, Peter A. Magowan, that, while Dart had been offering $58 a share, or $3.6 billion, he was prepared to raise the price to $64 a share, or $3.9 billion in cash. Safeway had rejected the $58-a-share offer, calling it inadequate. **********On Tuesday, Safeway replied that it needed more time to evaluate the offer, also announcing that it was holding talks with the ''third party.'' The company noted at the time that there was ''no assurance'' that the third party would make an offer. Purpose of Notification **********No parties to the talks would acknowledge the presence of Kohlberg, Kravis by name. Robert Hirsch, a Washington lawyer for Dart, said Thursday night that an officer of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Safeway's adviser, had told Dart's advisers that Safeway's board would be meeting on Friday to consider a takeover bid from the third party. **********The point of the notification, Mr. Hirsch said, was that Merrill Lynch told Dart's advisers that, if Dart was willing to raise its offer beyond $3.9 billion, it would have to move by Friday morning. According to Mr. Hirsch, Dart was also told that the third party said it would not bid if Safeway information it had been provided was also furnished to Dart or if Dart was told the third party's offer. **********Insiders at Dart are understood to regard this warning, particularly about supplying information to Dart, as bargaining rhetoric. In a letter to Mr. Magowan late Thursday, Mr. Haft complained that Safeway's failure to negotiate and to let Haft look at its financial records was not the ''level playing field'' called for by the courts in the recent takeovers of Revlon, SCM anf Fruehauf. In each of those cases, the courts opposed circumstances where one bidder was favored over another. **********Dart said it would sue Safeway and its directors if Safeway approved an offer from a third party, and, particularly, any protective moves that would be a part of such an offer. **********In a new letter to Safeway yesterday, Dart said that the right to fair and equal treatment was a ''fundamental legal requirement'' and that it expected to hear from Safeway shortly ''concerning the procedures which will be followed to fairly conclude the auction which is currently in process.'' **********In the biggest leveraged buyout in history, Kohlberg, Kravis led a group that bought the Beatrice Companies last year for $6.2 billion. It also bought Storer Communications last year for $2.5 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/02/business/electronic-publishing-on-rise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1024, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING ON RISE", "print_headline": "ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING ON RISE", "body_text": " **********The looming changes in Federal tax law have created a special challenge for Accountants Microsystems Inc., a Bellevue, Wash., maker of software for accountants. If Congress passes the tax revision bill, the company must revise its software packages and nearly six dozen support documents, including both graphics and text. And next year will require more product changes, according to Ole Kvern, the company's publications specialist. **********Yet Mr. Kvern said he was confident the task would be completed on time and within budget - all because of electronic publishing. **********''Our cost per page is now $1 to $3,'' he said. ''Before we got an electronic publishing system in November 1984, it was $10 to $15. And it shaves two-thirds of the time off the process.'' **********An electronic publishing system lets workers combine the basics of word processing - the ability to write, edit, proofread and transmit documents - with a graphics capability that allows them to integrate charts, tables, headlines and drawings into the documents. All the steps can be done at a video terminal. The result, whether one page long or of book length, can then be sent electronically to a typesetter or to a more modest office printer. Good Enough for Inside Use **********Although companies must still turn to outside commercial printers for sophisticated color printing and elaborate binding, desk-top publishing now enables them to produce almost any documents needed for internal use. **********Robert Reisner, director of financial analysis for the RCA Corporation, said: ''With such a compression of time and dollar savings, it's a non-issue. You have to buy an electronic publishing system.'' **********Such enthusiasm helps explain the spurt in computer publishing, an industry that grew to more than $500 million in sales last year from almost nothing in 1983, according to CAP International, a market research concern in Marshfield, Mass. **********Investors have been pouring millions of dollars into stock offerings by companies that provide software or integrated hardware-and-software systems for desk-top publishing. **********Interleaf Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., developer of software for computer-aided publishing and a packager of integrated systems, raised $24.6 million in its initial public offering in June. Xyvision Inc. of Wakefield, Mass., a software publisher, raised $18.9 million in the same month. Adobe Systems Inc., based in Palo Alto, Calif., which creates software for publishing, raised $5.6 million last month. I.B.M.'s Plans for New Unit **********The industry gained further attention when the International Business Machines Corporation announced the formation on July 2 of a unit to develop and market hardware and software designed specifically for computer-aided publishing (C.A.P., in industry jargon). **********The industry's rapid growth, with more than 150 companies now producing C.A.P. software, has led many observers to predict a wave of failures, acquisitions and alliances. **********''In the next six to 18 months we'll see the shakeout,'' said John Minniti, a contributing editor of Infovision's Electronic Publishing Buyers' Guide. **********But David H. Goodstein, president of Interconsult Inc., a Cambridge market research company, said, ''Electronic publishing is probably the richest unstaked territory in computers.'' **********Desk-top systems, which sell for $10,000 to $40,000 and are built around a personal computer, represent the industry's fastest-growing segment. Larger work-station systems, which can accommodate as many as five workers, sell for $30,000 to $120,000. The most sophisticated and costly systems, starting at $150,000, use powerful computers and are able to accommodate numerous work stations throughout a company. Savings in Time and Money **********Mr. Goodstein asserted that users of desk-top systems realized 50 percent savings in time and money. From an existing base of 40,000 to 50,000 units, he estimated, the number of desk-top publishing installations will increase by 1,000 a week this year and 2,500 to 3,000 a week in the next two years. **********The industry has developed in high-tech fashion. Interleaf was started in a basement by David Boucher and Harry George, with $20,000 of the $200,000 they earned in 1980 when the Xerox Corporation bought another company they had helped establish -Kurzweil Computer Products Inc., which makes optical scanners and voice synthesizers. **********Three of the founders of Xyvision left a NASA laboratory where they had worked on computer time-sharing technology to form a consulting firm. Its first product was a computerized pagination system. **********Apple Computer Inc. has also benefitted from the growth of computer publishing. Its Macintosh computer and Laserwriter printer ''were built almost ideally to do electronic publishing,'' Mr. Goodstein said. **********Software suppliers, such as Altos, Manhattan Graphics and Boston Software Publishers, all produce programs that allow Apple machines to perform publishing functions. Sectors May Blur Together **********Richard A. Shaffer, the editor of Technologic Computer Letter, predicts that the lines between this segment of the computer industry and others are likely to blur. **********''The incorporation of electronic publishing into other software requires general-purpose machines,'' he said. ''In the next two years, we'll see most word processing incorporate the basics of desk-top publishing.'' **********Such changes may hamper some companies. Atex, owned by Eastman Kodak and one of the nation's leading producers of newspaper production systems, ''is focused on the high end of the traditional graphic arts market and isn't so threatened,'' said Arlene Karsh of CAP International. **********But the situation is different for a smaller company like Compugraphic, another supplier of newspaper systems, she said. ''Their market has cracked open,'' she explained. ''More suppliers can produce products for smaller newspapers, shoppers, pennysavers and weeklies that are easy to use, don't involve chemicals, aren't so expensive and - by the way - can also run accounts receivable.'' **********In response, such companies as Compugraphic are expected to expand their line of products.

At some private exchange houses, the rate exceeded 500 pesos to the dollar by the end of business Friday. **********The 15 percent loss in the peso's value came after a monthlong recovery of the troubled currency that had led to talk of renewed confidence in Mexico's economic future. Dual Exchange Rate Cited **********Explanations for the dramatic slide revolved around Mexico's dual exchange rate system and the gap between the two rates, which had been steadily narrowing through December and early this month. The spread stood at 7.3 percent last Wednesday, the day before the sharp drop. **********One exchange rate, called the regulated float, is set daily by central bank officials and officials of the country's nationalized commercial banks. About 80 percent of Mexico's foreign exchange is conducted at this rate. **********The other rate is completely free and fluctuates in response to currency market demands. Through the fall, the value of the peso on the free rate steadily declined, reaching a range of 520 pesos to the dollar in the private exchange houses in November. The difference between the two rates then was 50 percent. **********Through December, however, the free-exchange peso began to strengthen, reaching 413 to the dollar on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the regulated rate steadily declined, one or two pesos a day. On Wednesday it stood at 380.8. **********The narrow gap between the two rates led to speculation here that Bank of Mexico officials might merge the rates into a single free rate. **********Fearing the creation of a new rate at the level of the lower regulated rate, some businesses decided to use their free market dollars before they lost more value. Others began buying dollars, creating demand in excess of supply. More Dollars Bought **********Thursday's 32-peso drop led to even more dollar buying on Friday by those who feared that the peso was on another bottomless plunge. **********Before the upheaval last week, Bank of Mexico officials and Government economists had been expressing pleasure at the peso's resurgence. They cited several factors. One was extremely tight lending policies imposed by the central bank on Mexican banks. Another occured when the central bank imposed new regulations intended to stop speculation in pesos abroad. Its target was the peso's futures market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The move worked, and within a few days trading in peso futures was halted. **********If central bankers had planned to merge the two exchange rates into a single free rate, that opportunity has been lost for the moment. **********If the free-rate peso continues to drop, central bankers may have to adopt other measures to shore up the currency.

Its stock was trading then above $33 a share - not far below its record price of $36.75 set in mid-1985. Here was an issue with steadily rising profits that, adjusted for numerous splits, sold as low as $1 a share in 1977. **********But, as 1986 unfolded, Humana's attraction began to fade in the marketplace. In retrospect, Humana offers a case history of how a single company, let alone an entire industry, can lose its glamour status with investors. **********The rumblings - not fully appreciated at the time - began as far back as 1983 when the Government changed the rules under which hospitals are reimbursed for their costs in treating Medicare patients. The result of various cutbacks by both the Government and private insurers was a rapid rise in the number of unused beds in the nation's hospitals. Hospitals are like hotels in that occupancy rates affect their profit picture. **********Early this year, analysts said the appeal of Humana was that the company had put into place a sort of insurance program designed to help fill its hospital beds. Humana had made what was widely believed to be a smart strategic move in entering the health insurance market with its Care Plus health maintenance organization - a marriage, as it were, of hospital management with insurance. **********''My sense is that the company's basic marketing thesis was correct,'' Margo L. Vignola of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin said yesterday. ''But the breakdown came in Humana's overly optimistic assumptions in its ability to steer patients to its own hospitals.'' **********To the surprise of the company and securities analysts alike, it turned out that many people insured under Care Plus used hospitals that were not part of Humana's chain. And, as a result of Humana's pricing structure with lower-than-average insurance premiums, medical expenses for treating these patients turned out to be far higher than expected. ''In all fairness,'' one analyst said, ''I think that Humana's management is quite savvy.'' **********But mounting losses, attributed chiefly to the Care Plus insurance program, led management to announce early this month that it would take a pretax charge of about $232 million in the final three months of the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 1986. After taxes, this charge is $131 million, or $1.27 a share. **********For all of the fiscal year 1986, the company expects to report operating income - before the charges - of $1.85 to $1.90 a share and net income of about 53 to 58 cents a share. For the fiscal year 1985, Humana earned a record $2.19 a share. **********By June of this year, in response to a company statement that earnings would show a decline for the third fiscal quarter ended May 31, Humana's stock already was under pressure as doubts began to arise in the minds of investors. Then, in July, the shares traded as low as $21.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock closed yesterday at $22.875, up 37.5 cents. **********Some analysts, such as Mrs. Vignola and John F. Hindelong of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, currently give the stock a ''neutral'' rating. **********''Because it is entrenched in Care Plus, Humana is less susceptible than other hospital management companies to restructuring moves in order to enhance shareholder values,'' Mrs. Vignola said. ''However, I don't anticipate that the company will make additional write-offs of any substance in fiscal 1987, when I estimate the company's earnings at $2.15 a share. Earlier, I had estimated those earnings at $2.35 a share.'' **********Despite her neutral rating on the stock, the Rothschild analyst believes that Humana took ''appropriate pre-emptive action'' with its $232 million pretax charge. **********Two other companies - the Hospital Corporation of America and National Medical Enterprises - have already instituted share repurchase programs as a means of enhancing shareholder values. And both Mrs. Vignola and Mr. Hindelong recommend these two issues over Humana. **********David H. Talbot of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said that Humana still faced ''a lot of rebuilding of investor confidence.'' However, among what he describes as ''the pure hospital management companies,'' Humana remains the analyst's best candidate for an earnings recovery in the coming year.

The Nicaraguan Government has treated the incident as a major political issue and as conclusive evidence of American aggression against Nicaragua. **********Some political analysts inside the Government, including militant members of the Sandinista Front, say they think Mr. Hasenfus must be imprisoned to satisfy demands of the new ruling party that he be punished and also to set an example for other Americans who might be tempted to assist the rebels, who are known as contras. 'The Smartest Thing' to Do **********But other Government officials, as well as foreign diplomats with close Government contacts, say that although they expect Mr. Hasenfus to be judged harshly by the political tribunal, they believe he may then be released in a carefully considered political gesture intended to show the world, and the American public in particular, that the Sandinistas are not vindictive. **********''It would be the smartest thing they could do,'' a Western diplomat said. ''He goes through the political tribunal, but is then released in show of magnanimity.'' **********Foreign Minister, Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann has indicated that Mr. Hasenfus will be treated generously, and President Daniel Ortega Saavedra seemed to signal a degree of tolerance as well, telling reporters that the Government considered Mr. Hasenfus as no more than a low-level employee of the rebel supply operation. **********But Mr. Ortega also said that justice would have to be done in the case - a consideration that might mean a jail term for Mr. Hasenfus, who has told reporters he did intend to drop guns to guerrillas. He is charged with political crimes that carry a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. There is no death penalty in Nicaragua. The Problem with a Pardon **********The problem with pardoning Mr. Hasenfus, say members of the Government and ruling Sandinista Party, is that it might anger Sandinista militants and those who have lost friends and family in the war that is now spreading over the northern regions of the country. **********Mr. Hasenfus presents an unlikely object of the debate. Until four months ago, he appears to have lived quietly with his wife and three children in Marinette, Wis. Urged by an old friend from the Vietnam War days, he says he flew to Central America to work on rebel flights mainly because he needed the money and it was an adventure. **********Mr. Hasenfus says he thought he had joined an operation backed by the Central Intelligence Agency. But he cannot prove that assumption, and he seems bewildered and irritated by the repeated assertions of American officials that he was not working for any branch of the Government. **********Because his case is being handled by the Sandinista political court, known as the Peoples Anti-Somocista Tribunals, Mr. Hasenfus has few legal rights and almost no access to his Nicaraguan lawyer, nor to his American legal adviser, former Attorney General Griffin B. Bell. **********Mr. Bell said Friday that the Sandinistas were making Mr. Hasenfus a scapegoat for more than 100 years of Nicaraguan altercations with the United States and that the imprisoned American stood little chance of fair treatment. He called on the Nicaraguan Government to narrow its case to specific charges, like arms smuggling, that Mr. Hasenfus could reply to. **********Mr. Hasenfus's Nicaraguan lawyer, Enrique Sotelo Borgen, has tried to challenge the legitimacy of the political court, and the Minister of Justice who controls it, to judge the case.

The arms include $261.8 million worth of equipment in Government warehouses and hundreds of millions of dollars' worth held by military contractors and a private Virginia warehouse. **********The equipment includes ammunition, at least one dismantled helicopter, air defense weapons, missiles, communications and radar equipment, jet aircraft engines, inertial navigational systems and chemicals as well as spare parts for F-4, F-5 and F-14 fighter planes, helicopters, missiles, armored personnel carriers and C-130 transports, and equipment for loading, shipping, cargo carrying and offices. **********'In Pretty Bad Shape' **********James A. Placke, an international affairs consultant and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, said: ''My impression is that over a period of time, the equipment has deteriorated considerably and most of it is worthless. By the time the Iranians can get it, they won't want it.'' **********A Government official acknowledged that much of the material ''is in pretty bad shape.'' **********Iran has said that the only way to improve relations is for the United States to release the Iranian-owned military equipment. **********In June 1985, for example, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan passed on a message from President Reagan to the Speaker of Iran's Parliament, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, expressing interest in improving relations. **********The Iranian leader replied that if the United States was serious, it should release the weapons that belong to Iran. U.S. Offered to Buy Back Arms **********State Department sources said the United States offered to buy back the weapons, but Iran refused. **********''Even if it is true that some of the equipment has deteriorated, it belongs to us and it is our decision to do what we want with it,'' an Iranian said. **********Some critics of the recent dealings with Iran have been wondering why the United States secretly sold arms taken from Israeli and American Government stocks instead of releasing the arms already owned by Iran in American warehouses. **********Arms experts believe that the Iranian-owned equipment would have had to be overhauled after seven years of storage. In addition, Iran probably asked for arms that were more up-to-date than the equipment ordered before 1979. Moreover, the release of the equipment in warehouses might have involved too many people to preserve secrecy. **********Even the best-kept military equipment has a limited shelf life, according to arms experts. Shelf Life Is 8 to 10 Years **********Woolf P. Gross, a former political-military adviser to the State Department who is now in private industry, said: ''Anything left in storage with Iran's name on it isn't worth very much. Anything chemical is long since gone, and even the shelf life of spare parts goes after 8 to 10 years.'' **********He said that Hawk missiles, for example, which use a solid chemical propellant, last eight years at best. **********Defense Department officials contend that the Iranian equipment under Pentagon control has been properly stored. **********When an Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague ruled in June that Iran could transfer $8 million to $10 million in arms from an unheated and unventilated New Jersey warehouse leased by Behring International, Inc. to another location, Iran found that flammable chemicals had leaked and had to pay $30,000 for these chemicals to be discarded, according to Iranian sources. **********''It was a rotten facility, a rathole,'' Bruno A. Ristau, a lawyer for Iran. ''In practical terms, probably half of the sophisticated equipment has rotted away.'' Moved to Virginia Site **********The equipment, which has now been transferred to Victory Van Corporation, a storage company in Alexandria, Va., included military aircraft components and spare parts, ground support equipment, miscellaneous machinery and chemicals, and equipment for inertial navigational systems and electronic systems, according to a 1985 ruling by the Claims Tribunal reprinted in the Iranian Assets Litigation Report, a newsletter. **********During the move, the Pentagon discovered that the equipment included a box of secret missile testing parts and took them to a secure Government warehouse despite Iranian charges of theft, an American official said. **********The American embargo on arms deliveries to Iran was imposed in November 1979 when militants seized the United States Embassy in Teheran, and President Carter ordered a halt in the shipment of $300 million in arms and spare parts. The value of the equipment rose to $575 million as other arms paid for by Iran was produced, according to Defense Department officials. Title to $123 Million in Arms **********Of that equipment, Iran had taken title to $123 million in arms, spare parts and other equipment. That arsenal is stored in Government warehouses, including $5 million in equipment at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. Since Iran never took title to the rest of the equipment, the Government sold all but $138.8 million of it, putting the proceeds into a trust fund that is being used to pay Iran's bills, including storage fees. **********The equipment that was not sold sits in Government warehouses, although it could be sold off or disposed of at any time by the Government as long as Iran is reimbursed. **********American officials and legal experts say that for the Government to lift the Executive Order that embargoed Iran's equipment could pose an interesting legal problem. **********Since the equipment was already paid for, it might not be subject to Congressional approval, but there is other legislation that prevents the Government from shipping arms to any country that is on the State Department list of nations that foment terrorism. And Iran remains on the list despite the Government's secret sales of arms that have given rise to the current furor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/business/turner-mgm-ua.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turner-MGM/UA", "print_headline": "Turner-MGM/UA", "body_text": " **********Ted Turner and his fellow stockholders, as expected, approved the entrepreneur's takeover of the MGM/UA Entertainment Company, which could open new doors for his cable television system. **********Stockholders of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. - including Mr. Turner, the chairman, who owns 81 percent - formally approved the merger plans in a 15-minute meeting.

Today, the French warned that, if they were not granted concessions by the big farming nations, the meeting could fail.  [ Page 37. ]  The Reagan Administration, while maintaining that a failure will put crushing strains on the world trading system, is still threatening to walk out if it does not win approval of its priorities. **********The Administration wants to show protectionist forces in Congress that the United States will gain more by opening foreign markets than closing American markets. But to convince Congress, the Administration has to show real opportunities for trade expansion. This is the reason for the push it is making to extend fair-trade rules to services, which employ 75 percent of all Americans and make up 57 percent of the gross national product. **********Developing countries, struggling with debt payments and declining prices for the commodities they export, are deeply suspicious about any accommodations they might have to make. They are resisting American demands for international rules covering trade in services, such as banking, insurance and telecommunications, government investment policies that sometimes distort trade flows and counterfeiting and copyright piracy. **********The weeklong meeting will bring together the 92 governments, or contracting parties, that are signatories to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a pact worked out 38 years ago to establish rules for world trade. **********The governments, whose ministers will converge upon a vacated hotel gambling casino at Uruguay's beach resort of Punta del Este, sell each other four-fifths of the $2 trillion of annual global exchanges of goods and services. **********After seven previous rounds, all within a GATT framework, world trade has grown eightfold. But it is now 13 years since the last effort was started. Called the Tokyo Round, it cut tariffs and made a stab at limiting nontariff barriers, such as government procurement codes, customs valuations, testing guidelines and rules covering subsidies. These are today's biggest restraints to trade growth. **********The latest initiative comes as the world economy has been battered by the precipitous rise and fall of oil prices, the foreign debt crisis in Latin America and other developing countries, severe trade imbalances in the industrialized countries and, in recent months, the greatest threat of protectionism in the United States in the postwar era. Dependent on Global Market **********At the same time the United States is more dependent on the global market than at any time in its history. Last year imports and exports represented one-fifth of the nation's output of goods and services. A quarter century earlier they amounted to a tenth. **********Reagan Administration officials call the new round a cornerstone of their international economic policy. Global trade expansion is seen as the key to renewed growth and resolution of both the debt crisis and the huge American trade deficit. **********By failing to deal with services and such other sectors as investment and intellectual property, ''GATT does not address many of the realities of modern trade,'' said Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative, who will head the large American delegation to the talks. But developing countries, led by Brazil and India, see the services initiative as a means of pushing American banks and insurance companies into their economies. **********Yet the same third world countries are calling for a standstill on protectionist measures in the United States and other developed countries and a commitment to roll back existing protection. Henry R. Nau, formerly on President Reagan's National Security Council and now a professor at George Washington University, said standstill and rollback commitments might lead to the phasing out of American textile, steel and other restrictions. **********The European Community and Japan, both of which favor extension of the negotiations to services, might make similar commitments. Compromises Discussed **********Even before the delegates begin to gather at Punta del Este, some compromises have been discussed. One is to swap a freeze by the United States on filing unfair trade cases for a date for completion of negotiations on services. The United States has initiated cases in recent months against Brazil, South Korea and other countries under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. Under threats of import curbs both South Korea and Taiwan recently agreed to permit more American insurance companies to operate in their markets. **********Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and an influential member of the Senate Finance Commitee, said: ''There have to be trade-offs. I think we've got to be willing to discuss everything.'' **********In agriculture, Mr. Yeutter has already indicated American willingness to put all its subsidies on the negotiating table. The United States and the European Community each spend $25 billion a year to support farm production. France, the biggest agricultural producer in the European Community, is willing to discuss agriculture but unwilling to commit to any phaseout of subsidies. **********The aim of the GATT conference this week is to write a document that would serve as the guidelines for a new trade round. Forty-eight of the participants at a meeting last July in Geneva agreed on one draft, maintaining reservations on some of the language. But 10 developing countries - India, Brazil, Yugoslavia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, Argentina and Egypt - wrote their own draft, which made no mention of services and other areas the United States was interested in. No Mandate Seen **********Those countries, which have become known as the Group of 10, argue that GATT has no mandate for negotiation in the new areas and that industrial countries should live up to their existing anti-protectionist commitments on trade before moving into new fields. Mr. Yeutter was referring to these countries when he said recently that a ''small group of nations continues to hold the interests of the majority hostage to their objectives, which seem to me contrary to their own self-interest.'' **********Although GATT is a relatively weak agency, with no enforcement powers or other sanctions, the United States has used it as the centerpiece of its trade policy for nearly four decades. To meet complaints by American companies about unfair foreign trade practices, another American goal in the talks is to strengthen GATT's machinery, especially its dispute settlement procedures. **********Ironically, Congress, reluctant to cede authority over American trade policy, rejected a strong world trade organizaton when the issue was first taken up by the international community in 1947. GATT was not intended to be a trade organization, but only a specfic trade agreement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/15/business/massey-ferguson.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 40, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Massey-Ferguson", "print_headline": "Massey-Ferguson", "body_text": " **********Massey-Ferguson Ltd. is changing its name to the Varity Corporation and expects to announce an acquisition soon, its chairman, Victor Rice, said.

He said the plan was ''different from the things that we have heard in the past from leaders in the Soviet Union.'' **********''It's just about the first time that anyone has ever proposed actually eliminating nuclear weapons,'' Mr. Reagan said, responding to questions at a civil rights ceremony in the Cabinet Room. **********His comments came as American and Soviet negotiators resumed arms talks in Geneva, where the Russians formally introduced Mr. Gorbachev's proposal. It was announced Wednesday on Soviet television and by the official press agency Tass. #4th Round of Arms Talks The session today in Geneva marked the first time that the two sides had met since the conference between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev there in November. It was the fourth round of talks since the latest phase of arms negotiations began last March 12. **********Mr. Gorbachev's offer called for a timetable to eliminate all nuclear weapons within 15 years. The Soviet leader insisted, however, that the scrapping of nuclear weapons could start only if the United States renounces the testing and deployment of space-based defenses, popularly known as ''Star Wars.'' **********''We're very grateful for the offer,'' Mr. Reagan said this morning. ''We're studying it with great care, and it is going to depend now on what takes place in Geneva.'' 'Historic Significance' **********In Moscow, the Soviet press today heralded Mr. Gorbachev's latest proposal as ''a peace initiative of historic significance.'' The full text of the plan filled the front pages of all Soviet newspapers. Tass, in an analysis, proclaimed it ''truly a milestone.'' **********Tass also reported President Reagan's statement that he would study the proposal carefully and said it detected ''constructive'' elements in the initial American response. But the Soviet report said the White House ''completely passes over in silence the issue of preventing the creation, testing and deployment of space strike weapons.'' **********Mr. Reagan's public reaction, coupled with a cautiously worded official White House statement, reflected the interest and, to some degree, surprise, stirred by the Gorbachev proposal. Publicly and privately, White House officials criticized the Soviet leader, however, for publicizing the sweeping offer in what Administration officials termed a blatant effort to gather Western European support. ''We think the nitty-gritty and the business of serious negotiation has to be done in private so that one side doesn't play against the other or use it for propaganda tactics,'' Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said. ''For our part, we would prefer to have discussions at the table in privacy.'' **********Another White House official said that in announcing the proposal only several hours after Mr. Reagan had been notified of it in a letter by Mr. Gorbachev, the Russians were ''seeking to bring public pressure on the U.S. Government, especially by the Europeans.'' He added, ''They're seeking to portray themselves as flexible.'' **********The official said: ''Obviously what this reflects is an astute Soviet policy of using the dual track - private communication before a public diplomacy effort to bring pressure on the U.S. to respond. We would clearly prefer these exchanges be kept confidential and private.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev's proposal called for the ''complete elimination'' of American and Soviet medium-range missiles in Europe. Absent from the proposal was the usual Soviet demand that British and French nuclear arsenals be counted against weapons the United States is allowed to have in Europe. Instead, Mr. Gorbachev proposed that Britain and France pledge not to enlarge their nuclear arsenals. 'The Proof of the Pudding' **********Mr. Speakes, responding to questions, said, ''Perhaps it does remove a stumbling block, but the British and French will have to answer.'' Over all, he said, ''the proof of the pudding will be at Geneva and how the Soviets approach the talks beginning today.'' **********Mr. Reagan voiced optimism about the proposal at a ceremony honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Roy Wilkins in the Cabinet Room. **********Asked if he was encouraged by the Gorbachev letter outlining the new Soviet plan, Mr. Reagan responded: ''Yes. It is different from the things that we have heard in the past from leaders in the Soviet Union.'' **********Asked whether the plan represented a new Soviet commitment to negotiate an agreement, Mr. Reagan said, ''We're going to find out.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev's announcement also included a three-month extension of the Soviet moratorium on nuclear tests. The United States has refused to take part. 'It's Important That We Do Test' **********''We are suspicious of Soviet moratoriums on testing because, in the past, the Soviets have proposed moratoria on tests and at the same time have broken moratoria on tests,'' Mr. Speakes said. **********''We feel that the Soviets have an advantage and for the moment don't need to test. The United States feels that for our own national security it's important that we do test.'' **********In his new offer, Mr. Gorbachev also said it was crucial that the United States and the Soviet Union ''renounce the development, testing and deployment'' of ''space strike weapons.'' That is the Soviet term for the Administration's space-based defense plan. **********At a news conference, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger said it was ''very, very worrisome'' that the Soviet Union continued to link its arms proposal to a ban on the Administration's antimissile space shield concept. The comment was echoed by White House officials."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/28/business/may-stores-loan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "May Stores Loan", "print_headline": "May Stores Loan", "body_text": " **********May Department Stores has arranged with Citibank to advance up to $300 million as part of a total $1.5 billion financing for the company's tender offer to acquire the Associated Dry Goods Corporation, according a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Asked how long he would stay on at Eastern, which agreed Monday to be acquired by Texas Air, Mr. Borman said, ''Who knows?'' **********Mr. Lorenzo said he would honor Mr. Borman's contract, which Mr. Borman said was a ''very long'' one. **********The two men appeared cordial and relaxed at the 45-minute conference, smiling at times and referring to each other by first names. They sat together at a table in a meeting room at Eastern's executive offices here. **********Mr. Lorenzo said that he endorsed the agreement reached Sunday with Eastern's pilots, who accepted a 20 percent reduction in salary, and said that ''it is essential'' that Eastern get concessions from the International Association of Machinists, whose contract has two years to run. The machinists' earlier refusal to grant certain concessions led to the takeover. **********Mr. Lorenzo's remarks on concessions brought a strong reaction from John Peterpaul, the machinists' general vice president. ''We're willing to help,'' he said in Washington. ''But we'll never accept the conditions that we have been threatened with.'' **********Both Mr. Borman and Mr. Lorenzo suggested that Eastern's operations and routes would remain basically the same, and Mr. Lorenzo said Eastern would remain based in Miami. **********''Let's be candid,'' Mr. Borman remarked at one point during the news conference, ''Mr. Lorenzo and I have an understanding.'' **********Eastern, he said, would be a subsidiary. ''It will be operated as a separate entity with management in place,'' Mr. Borman said. ''In the interim period between now and approval, I am running Eastern Airlines. I will listen to Texas Air and we are going to cooperate in a very close manner.'' Texas Air also owns Continental Airlines and New York Air. **********Formal approval of the $600 million acquisition of Eastern, the nation's third-largest airline, could take months. The deal has to be approved by Eastern's shareholders and creditors and the Department of Transportation. **********Mr. Lorenzo said that the acquisi-tion would increase employee stability at Eastern, but added that the company must remain competitive and profitable. **********''The only guarantee of ultimate stability and no furloughs,'' he said, ''is profitability and viability. And as we all know, there is no Santa Claus.'' **********Asked if he would categorically rule out a move that would place Eastern in Chapter 11 protection, he responded: ''I cannot imagine it being an option.'' **********At the machinists' union headquarters in Washington, Mr. Peterpaul responded: ''We're very disappointed and angry about the sale. All we've gotten so far from Eastern is ultimatums. Eastern employees have already given back $800 million over the years.'' **********For his part, Mr. Borman portrayed the deal as the best one open to Eastern. 'We're Very Pleased'' **********''It was either fix it, sell it or merge it,'' Mr. Borman said at the news conference. ''Since we couldn't fix it, we merged it, and we're very pleased with it.'' **********''It is in the best interests not only of the employees and the airlines, but also of Florida and the country in general,'' Mr. Borman said. **********He said the Eastern board believes ''the deal is done'' and that no other takeovers would be considered, even at a higher price. **********The 58-year-old Eastern chairman, a former astronaut, said in response to reporters' questions that he had not been sought out as a possible candidate to direct the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. **********Mr. Lorenzo was generally noncommittal in his answers about his plans for Eastern. He said he had no intention of selling New York Air or its New York-Washington and New York-Boston routes, which compete with Eastern's shuttle operation. Antitrust lawyers have suggested that to win Government approval, Texas Air would have to agree to sell either its or Eastern's shuttle services. **********He also objected to the ''union-buster'' label that many unions have pinned on him, citing his tactics after acquiring Continental Airlines in 1982. After placing Continental under Chapter 11 protection, Mr. Lorenzo repudiated union contracts and slashed wages in half in turning the carrier into a low-cost airline. Coping With Deregulation **********''We are not union busters,'' he said, adding, ''Some people make that accusation from time to time because we've had to do what was necessary.'' **********His theme that deregulation has imposed a ''new reality'' on the airlines and its employees was later echoed by Mr. Borman. **********''Labor negotiations in the airline industry are going to be difficult,'' the Eastern chairman said. ''The free market is in control now. It is not management trying to bust unions. It's simply a fact of life of the marketplace now that we're trying to produce a product at a price that will make money.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/business/advertising-putting-cognac-in-subways.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Putting Cognac in Subways", "print_headline": "Advertising; Putting Cognac in Subways", "body_text": " **********IF you are lucky enough to be a New York subway rider, then you must have noticed the advertisements for Mumm V.S.O.P. Cognac. They are hard to miss really, since Seagram has contracted for what in effect are arches of advertising in 4,500 of the city's 6,000 cars. **********New York, the country's richest cognac market by far, is also one of the poorest in terms of availability of billboards in the city itself. And Mumm Cognac, being a distilled spirit banned from broadcast advertising, has used outdoor as the backbone of its introductory campaign in other markets as well as newspapers where there is a shortage of outdoor sign space. **********In most cities, outdoor advertising is an excellent way of reaching people driving to and from work. In New York, ads in the underground provide the same service. **********''How in this market can you get an advertising message across intrusively?'' asked Jerry Greenstein, national product manager. ''When you take TV and radio out, what do you have left?'' **********The advertising display itself is rather arresting, especially to a brandy lover. It is made up, where possible, of two posters, 11 inches by 28 inches, flanking - above the door - an 11-by-42-inch poster, while 22-by-21-inch posters frame the door. **********Originally when the ad was posted, the display consisted of the pictures of 13 of Mumm's distinctive black bottles and snifters and the line, in rather small type, ''The Finest Name in French Champagne Is Now the Finest Name in Cognac.'' Now, in more of the holiday spirit, it reads, ''There is no finer gift than the finest name in cognac.'' And the top panels have no bottles, no glasses, but a very big Mumm logotype. **********When Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, a leader in the field of distilled spirits, decided to move more vigorously into the cognac arena, where it had been only barely represented, it decided to capitalize on the Mumm name, which had been big in champagne for more than 150 years. **********The reason for the company's interest in cognac is easy enough to figure, since the category doubled between 1976 and 1980 and grew another 62 percent from then to 1985. **********''Cognac is the fastest growing in the distilled spirits business,'' said Mr. Greenstein, noting that sales of all cognacs were about 2.2 million cases last year, about the same as schnapps, another growth category. **********About cognac's growth, he said, ''It has a certain cachet as a prestigious distilled spirit a step up from everything else.'' (Mumm sells for about $20 a fifth, or 750 milliliters.) Sales, he went on, are divided about 50-50 between blacks and whites. Many of the latter are likely to be upper-income white males in the 25-to-49 age group, who, he said, drink it straight, while many in the former group mix it with such things as ginger ale, orange juice and colas. **********The company's media selection mirrors this audience. The publications include Gentlemen's Quarterly, Playboy, Penthouse, Sports Illustrated and Time as well as Ebony, Ebony Man, Jet, Black Enterprise and American Vision. **********Seagram first went into a half-hearted test in Boston and San Francisco in the fall of 1980, but nothing developed from it. In October 1984, however, it spread the product into half the country for a really big tests. It went national a year later. Its original agency was North Castle Partners in Greenwich, Conn. Now it is at DDB Needham Worldwide, with Mingo-Jones Advertising doing the promotion to the black community. **********In January 1985, Seagram reorganized its marketing operation, grouping its brands according to their market strategies. Mumm Cognac was in 375 Spirits with such upscale kindred spirits as Chivas Regal and Glenlivet Scotches and Myers rum. At the same time it eliminated its Outco unit, which had been buying all out-of-home media, and set up House of Seagram Media, which now buys all advertising space and time for all Seagram brands. **********Since that time, Mumm Cognac has moved into third place among V.S.O.P. - very superior old pale -cognacs, after Remy Martin and Courvoisier. Its ad budget is roughly $3 million, out of which comes the $7,500 a month for subway advertising. The $3 million is a reasonable total, since all advertising for cognacs is only about $22.5 million for a year. **********Because of the importance of the black consumer to the success of this brand, Seagram also mounted a public relations effort directed by Ronda Racz that was centered on a two-week tribute to black film makers called ''From Harlem to Hollywood,'' which also served to raise funds for a Black Film Makers Hall of Fame and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. **********And, by the way, since Mumm Cognac built its arch of advertising, Seagram's Ronrico rum also used the configuration to promote its Miss Ronrico New York competition.

But one source that has not been mentioned yet is the ABC television network. It will provide tickets to TV sponsors of ABC News coverage of the four-day event on the Fourth of July weekend. **********ABC-TV is using the tickets as pot sweeteners, an extra added attraction for advertisers. Then the advertisers themselves can turn around and use them as an incentive for their customers, sales people, dealers, bottlers, franchisees or anybody else in need of a carrot on a stick. **********For the top four sponsors - I.B.M. with 16 minutes and K Mart, Chrysler and Prudential-Bache, each with 13 1/2 minutes - the reward is 10 tickets for the exclusive stands to be constructed aboard the carrier John F. Kennedy, from which the President of the United States will light the spotlights on the beloved Lady in the harbor. **********There will be even more tickets to other events and to the closing ceremonies in the Byrne Arena in the Meadowlands of New Jersey which will be followed by an ABC-sponsored bash in the stadium club. **********The other sponsors, all taking about seven minutes each, are Stroh's Beer, Avon, Texaco, Lipton, Van Heusen shirts, the United States Treasury, which has minted commemorative coins, and Castle & Cooke, which will be promoting Dole Fruit and Cream Bars. **********''We are already 90 percent sold out, and we still don't have a soft drink or fast-food chain,'' said Robert I. Silberberg, the network's vice president and general sales manager, obviously putting out a welcome mat for the missing categories. **********Things have changed a bit since David L. Wolper, the executive producer and the man who knocked them dead with the Summer Olympics closing ceremonies, began his planning for the four days. Originally scheduled for 10 hours of prime time telecasting and 3 hours of daytime, it has now grown to 11 and 3 and may now go up another hour of daytime on the Friday of the weekend. **********The current amount of commercial minutes are 77 for prime and 36 for daytime. The time is selling in 30-second units at $165,000 and $30,000, respectively. And, although it may be hard to believe, Mr. Silberberg said the prices are nonnegotiable. **********''We are not selling by C.P.M.,'' said he, referring to the cost per thousand advertising rate by which companies judge the efficiency of advertising outlays. This show is for the company that wants to gain by association with a historic event - and, as noted, wants to gain from the merchandising possibilities as well. **********According to Mr. Silberberg, his 21 sales people based in four cities first approached the corporations that already are sponsors of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation. Generally they were cool to the idea of television sponsorship. **********One of the sales people's most valuable selling tools, however, was a five-minute video cassette in which Mr. Wolper, with the help of some rather elaborate illustrations, describes the planned events. **********For anyone not aware of what the producer is capable of, his descriptions are reminiscent of the way comics once spoofed Ed Sullivan's recitation of coming attrations. (Remember ''. . . and a drill team of 2,000 Polish dentists''?) For example, a few of the Statue of Liberty high points: *********** During the lighting ceremony and before the largest fireworks display ever seen, a choir of 700 voices will sing ''America the Beautiful.'' *********** With the help of satellite transmission, 25,000 new American citizens will be seen being sworn in. *********** The captains of the 150 Tall Ships will parade. *********** The Boston Pops will perform away from its home field on a Fourth of July for the first time. *********** There will be concerts of the most famous people in all styles of music at a number of sites, including an appearance by the New York Philharmonic in Central Park. *********** And one of the closing events will be the running of the Statue of Liberty Mile, with the world's 10 best runners, as well as an exhibition of ice skating and gymnastics. The show, which will include space ships and laser beams, will have a cast of 15,000, including the 780-piece All American Statue of Liberty Band and a 1,000-voice choir. **********Sounds even more exciting than those commercials."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/25/business/us-seeks-changes-at-thrift-units.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1986-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 762, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. SEEKS CHANGES AT THRIFT UNITS", "print_headline": "U.S. SEEKS CHANGES AT THRIFT UNITS", "body_text": " **********In a series of sweeping new regulatory initiatives, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board proposed today to require thrift institutions to double their net worth over a period of six years and gradually adopt generally accepted accounting principles. **********The agency also proposed to increase the requirements on the thrift units' holdings of liquid assets such as Treasury bills. And it gave final approval to a regulation that would permit more interstate acquisitions of thrift institutions. **********After more than five years of relaxed accounting and regulatory standards, the bank board took steps to restore financial integrity to the industry's weakened balance sheets. **********''There's never been a better time than the current low interest rate environment to move the thrift industry toward higher levels of capital and stronger balance sheets,'' Edwin J. Gray, the bank board chairman, said. Weeks of Discussion **********The actions came after weeks of private conversations between the bank board and the industry. Mr. Gray and other officials had quietly floated the proposals both in Washington and among industry experts. However, today's action was the first public move by the agency. **********While the industry has generally supported proposals for greater discipline, it is expected to oppose the bank board on the six-year timetable, contending that it would be an almost impossible standard for a majority of the industry to meet. **********In all, the bank board voted on seven regulatory actions aimed at improving the financial health of the industry and dealing with a backlog of hundreds of insolvent institutions at the least cost possible to its already weakened deposit insurance fund. **********The bank board proposed to increase the minimum net worth requirements for savings and loan institutions to 6 percent of total assets, from the current level of 3 percent, over the next six years. In 1980, as scores of institutions were hemorrhaging from high interest rates, Congress gave the bank board authority to lower the minimum capital level to 4 percent and later to 3 percent, from 5 percent, to avoid having to shut hundreds of institutions. A 6-Year Transition **********Under the agency's proposed rule, which it put out for a 60-day comment period, after Oct. 1, 1986, any increase in a thrift institution's size would have to be capitalized at a 6 percent level, while it would have until six years later to increase its capital levels to 6 percent of all its assets. **********Capital is the financial cushion that depository institutions can draw on in time of trouble, and as problems have increased in the banking and thrift industries in recent years, regulators have been trying to increase the required minimum capital levels. **********At the same time, the agency proposed a risk-based capital program that would require a thrift unit to set aside substantially higher levels of capital for such assets as direct investments in building projects, loans to builders of nonresidential properties and letters of credit. **********However, an institution would be permitted to fall below the 6 percent miminum if it holds certain low-risk assets. **********Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency proposed similar risk-based capital standards that would either supplement or replace the current 6 percent minimum levels at banks. **********The bank board approved these other measures today: *********** A proposal to require thrift units to begin reporting their financial results according to generally accepted accounting principles, with the goal of phasing out the more more liberal regulatory accounting principles now in use. *********** A proposal requiring thrift institutions to keep a minimum of 6 percent, up from 5 percent, of ''liquidity'' -short-term cash instruments such as Treasury bills or commercial paper. The board's staff said the new rule would affect 10 percent of the industry's institutions. *********** A final rule, approved unanimously, enabling an institution acquiring a troubled thrift unit to set up branches in up to three states other than the home state of the insolvent thrift unit. *********** A proposal to give federally chartered thrift institutions the same merger privileges as state-chartered institutons. **********The bank board, in a unanimous vote, also agreed to permit thrift units based in the District of Columbia to branch into either Maryland or Virginia, but not both, and to permit Maryland and Virginia-based institutions to move into Washington. However, it barred institutions owning thrift units in Maryland or Virginia from changing their domiciles to those states in order to branch into Washington."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/05/world/arafat-accuses-syria-and-libya-in-raids.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARAFAT ACCUSES SYRIA AND LIBYA IN RAIDS", "print_headline": "ARAFAT ACCUSES SYRIA AND LIBYA IN RAIDS", "body_text": " **********Syria and Libya are behind the recent rash of terrorist attacks in the Mediterranean and Europe and are trying to discredit the Palestine Liberation Organization and hinder negotiations with Israel, Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said in an interview published in today's issue of the Washington Post. **********Mr. Arafat also said the United States, by refusing to negotiate with the P.L.O., had stalled Middle East peace efforts and helped create an environment in which young Palestinians are recruited for terrorist operations by Arab intelligence agencies. **********The Post said the interview was conducted a week ago in Tunis. **********Mr. Arafat called Sabry al-Banna, thought to be a key figure in recent terrorist attacks, a ''tool for some Arab intelligence services.'' **********Mr. Banna, who uses the name Abu Nidal, heads a group believed to have hijacked an Egyptian jet to Malta in November and conducted the Dec. 27 airport attacks in Vienna and Rome. **********''He is only a front for these Arab services, nothing more,'' Mr. Arafat said.

Currently, most lenders book the revenue at once when they disburse the cash. **********At the same time, the rule would require thrift institutions to recognize immediately as expenses many indirect costs of making loans, including advertising and lending officers' salaries. Some thrift institutions already follow this practice, but others have chosen to defer reporting these costs. Confusion in Reports Seen **********The proposal has the thrift industry upset. In addition to believing it would produce confusion in financial reports and difficulties in bookkeeping, savings executives argue that the proposal would reduce profits. **********As the accounting board began public hearings here today on the proposed standard, witnesses wasted little time expressing their displeasure. The board has received nearly 1,000 comment letters, the vast majority opposed. ''We're talking about dramatically changing the way the thrift industry does business with no positive result,'' said George L. Engelke, chairman of the committee on accounting issues for the United States League of Savings Institutions, the thrift industry's trade group. **********At the center of the debate is whether the application fees, which borrowers pay to have their loan applications processed; the origination fees, called ''points'' in the savings industry, and commitment fees, which borrowers pay to lock in an interest rate, constitute separate sources of revenue, or are part of the overall revenue a lender receives from a loan. Many industry executives believe that loan origination is a separate business, and they contend that they should continue to be able to book all the revenue from loan originations at once. Differences and 'Abuses' **********The standards board disagrees. It took up the question of accounting for loan fees after discovering that lenders with similar operations were accounting for fees differently. It also uncovered ''abuses,'' the booking by institutions of huge amounts of fee income without reporting the corresponding expenses. The board's staff concluded that originating a loan was part of lending. The board thus proposed that, just as interest revenue was reported over time, ''origination fees should be recognized over the life of the loan,'' said Peter Horoszko, who is overseeing the loan-fee project at the standards board. **********At today's hearing, however, savings executives, with accountants and other industry specialists, testified that the proposal could bring more problems than solutions. They seemed particularly concerned about the requirement that the proposal be applied retroactively. Many savings executives said they did not have the records to restate earlier results. **********The board will hold two more days of hearings.

Much of the time, the Japanese leader found himself being called to account for his country's imperial past, especially its harsh colonial rule of Korea from 1910 to 1945. **********For the second time in two weeks Mr. Nakasone apologized for remarks by his former Education Minister, Masayuki Fujio, a man of extreme-right views who repeatedly made comments that Koreans considered insulting. Seeks to 'Heal the Wound' **********''I sincerely regret the remarks that caused anger among all Koreans and hurt Korea's national pride and sensibilities,'' the Prime Minister said at a news conference today. The incident threatened to ''throw cold water'' on diplomatic relations between the two countries, he acknowledged, but he said he wanted to ''heal the wound.'' **********He also promised to try to modify laws that require foreigners living in Japan, most of whom are Koreans, to be fingerprinted every five years. **********Throughout his weekend stay, Mr. Nakasone was made uncomfortable by the need to atone so publicly before President Chun Doo Hwan and other South Koreans. **********He dismissed Mr. Fujio this month for telling a Japanese magazine that Koreans had only themselves to blame for Japan's annexation of Korea. Their leaders had agreed to it, the Education Minister said, a point that historians consider highly distorted since the agreement came under armed duress. **********For Koreans, the remarks were particularly offensive because they regard the Japanese occupation as a humiliating chapter in their history. Several Koreans also noted that Mr. Nakasone, while lamenting the diplomatic consequences of the incident, never specifically said today that he thought Mr. Fujio's view was incorrect. **********The controversy has had strong ripple effects, igniting fears abroad about resurgent Japanese militarism and producing a counterreaction at home among nationalists who contend that Japan should stop apologizing to foreigners for its past. An Issue for Chun's Foes **********In South Korea, the episode has provided a new issue for Mr. Chun's opponents. Anti-Japanese feelings remain sturdy here, a point underlined Saturday when 18 dissidents began a hunger strike in a Roman Catholic church to protest the Nakasone visit. **********''We feel there is a neo-nationalist mood on the rise in Japan,'' a Korean journalist said. **********For campus radicals, a potent and increasingly violent force, Japan often figures prominently in denunciations of Mr. Chun, whom they accuse of being a ''puppet'' of both Tokyo and Washington. Perhaps as a result, the South Korean Government issued no clear statement today saying that Mr. Chun accepted the Japanese leader's regrets and thus considered the Fujio episode to be behind him. **********It was ''deliberate policy,'' said an editor with Government ties. ''If he accepts the apology, he runs the risk of a public reaction,'' the editor said. ''That's a very sensitive point for President Chun.'' **********The affair demonstrated the degree to which South Korea and Japan, though friendly neighbors these days, continue to be haunted by ancient prejudices and hurts. Economic Friction and Envy **********Many Koreans feel resentment that has been deepened lately by a trade deficit with Japan that may approach $6 billion this year. Yet at the same time they admire Japan's economic success and seek to emulate it. **********Anti-Tokyo grievances include the forced fingerprinting of Koreans, who comprise more than 80 percent of the foreign residents in Japan. **********Mr. Nakasone said he would seek legislation that would make foreigners go through the process only once."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/03/business/eastern-air-will-lay-off-1534-as-part-of-a-drive-to-stem-losses.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1986-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 976, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EASTERN AIR WILL LAY OFF 1,534 AS PART OF A DRIVE TO STEM LOSSES", "print_headline": "EASTERN AIR WILL LAY OFF 1,534 AS PART OF A DRIVE TO STEM LOSSES", "body_text": " **********Eastern Air Lines Inc. yesterday announced plans for one of its deepest cutbacks in an effort to stem its losses. **********The moves include the layoffs of 1,534 employees, which are intended to save the airline $54 million a year. Some of the jobs lost will be in New York, but many more will be in Miami. Hundreds of management workers and hundreds of the workers who maintain Eastern's planes will be laid off. **********The cut in the maintenance jobs could compound an important problem at Eastern, which has had an unusually high number of flight cancellations because of maintenance backlogs. Eastern said the cuts would not hurt service. **********The airline also announced plans to improve labor productivity and to cut back the purchases of goods and services to save an additional $106 million. All told, Eastern hopes to cut operating costs by about $160 million a year. **********Several analysts said the $160 million in savings could make the carrier profitable. ''This will make a difference,'' said Timothy Pettee, an airline analyst for Bear, Stearns & Company. **********In the first half of this year, the airline lost $154.7 million. Its performance has usually been much better in the third quarter. End of Borman Strategy **********The layoffs signal the abandonment of the strategy pursued by Frank Borman, who resigned as Eastern's chairman last June. He sought to expand the carrier, not to cut it back. The goal was to build an airline that could compete with such low-cost carriers as People Express. **********In today's move, some in the industry saw the hand of Frank A. Lorenzo, the chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, which agreed last spring to buy Eastern for $676 million. Mr. Lorenzo took the Continental Airlines Corporation into bankruptcy proceedings and, by slashing wages and costs, enabled the airline to become profitable. Continental emerged from bankruptcy proceedings just yesterday. **********Like Continental, Eastern has good routes, a modern fleet and some extremely profitable operations, such as the Washington, New York and Boston shuttles. But its costs are too high for the intense fare wars that often break out in its markets. **********The Department of Transportation turned down the Texas Air-Eastern merger last week, citing competitive objections, particularly on the shuttles. But Texas Air has said it would try to meet those objections and seek approval again. The merger would create the nation's largest airline, surpassing United Airlines. **********Edward J. Starkman, an airline analyst at Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins, said the cost savings could have a big effect on Eastern's earnings. Without the cutbacks, he calculated that Eastern would have an operating profit of about $100 million this year but that interest costs on its debt would create a $100 million loss. Thus, $160 million in savings could make the carrier profitable, he estimated. **********Mr. Pettee, the analyst at Bear, Stearns, said, ''Eastern is not really the basket case that prior events might have indicated it was.'' He added that, after years of confrontation between management and labor, there had been less strife this year. Mr. Borman did get important union concessions but union leaders lost faith in him, and some rancor lingers. $2.5 Billion in Debt The cutbacks, while substantial, are just the latest the carrier has taken in the last decade to cope with the competitive pressures of deregulation. It also is weighed down by $2.5 billion of debt and has several times been in default on its loans. Each time it has convinced lenders that it has a workable plan to restore profits. **********The layoffs, to begin on Sept. 19, include 442 management employees. The bulk of the layoffs, about one-third, will affect Miami, where the airline has its headquarters. **********The layoffs will cut Eastern's work force by about 3.6 percent, to 39,800. Besides management, the hardest hit are the machinists' union, which will lose 493 members out of about Eastern's 13,000 members in the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. **********The positions taken by Charles E. Bryan, the leader of the machinists' union at Eastern, were a major reason Eastern's directors decided to sell the airline to Mr. Lorenzo. Concessions Rejected **********Mr. Bryan refused to give the wage and benefit concessions asked for by management even though the pilots' and the flight attendants' unions had agreed to major concessions. His refusal, many analysts said, forced the board to accept the Texas Air proposal. **********Glenn Parsons, a spokesman for Eastern, said that the machinists were not being singled out but that ''these are jobs that have been identified as not essential at this time.'' **********The carrier recently shook up the management of its maintenance division and has put in two new executives to improve performance. **********Some union leaders and rank-and-file members have said in interviews that uncertainties about their jobs and what would happen after a Texas Air takeover caused low morale that has affected job performance. **********Many workers are affected by rumors that frequently sweep through the company. Mike Pedano, a fueler at La Guardia Airport for Eastern, said that yesterday's action was ''just the start of something bigger.'' He believes that Eastern will cut more routes and try to turn more to non-union workers. **********Many actions are perceived by workers as an attempt by Texas Air to take over Eastern's assets. For example, the carrier has announced that it is ending its daily round-trips between Miami and London and has reduced flights from Charlotte, N.C., to 12 from 53. Mr. Pedano and other workers, and some union leaders, see this as a strategy on the part of Mr. Lorenzo to make Eastern mostly a carrier in the East and have Texas Air's Continental subsidiary take over its Middle Western markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/15/world/dead-ends-fail-to-discourage-swede-seeking-palme-s-killer.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Lelyveld", "pub_date": "1986-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1216, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEAD ENDS FAIL TO DISCOURAGE SWEDE SEEKING PALME'S KILLER", "print_headline": "DEAD ENDS FAIL TO DISCOURAGE SWEDE SEEKING PALME'S KILLER", "body_text": " **********By today, the 74th day of the investigation into the murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme, who was gunned down here on his way home from the movies with his wife, police investigators had fed 23,272 separate documents into the computer they are using to collate a constantly expanding mass of information. **********The material included statements by informants and witnesses, summaries of leads and tips, reports on the activities of individuals who might be suspects or known to suspects, anything at all of potential value. **********But despite the volume of information, Hans Holmer, the man running the largest murder investigation Scandinavia and possibly Europe has seen, could not say whether the killer acted on his own or with accomplices, whether he was Swedish or foreign, whether he was crazed, hired or seeking revenge. Some Possibilities Ruled Out **********What Mr. Holmer, Stockholm's Police Commissioner, could say in his first interview with a foreign journalist since the shooting, was that more than ten weeks of systematic police work had put him in a position to start closing off some paths of investigation as probable dead ends. He said he believed that meant he must be getting closer to the heart of the matter, even if he was still searching. **********The investigation has become his whole life. His other duties have been delegated to subordinates. Instead of keeping a safe bureaucratic distance, as a Swedish commissioner would normally do on even the biggest of cases, he has taken up permanent residence in a special situation room at police headquarters here that is the nerve center of the investigation. **********''Palme Room,'' says the sign outside. Inside, the walls are covered with photographs of the area in which the Prime Minister was shot, taken from helicopters, from street level, or with witnesses showing where they were standing when Mr. Palme fell. The computer operator sits at his terminal in the corner. Following the example set by Mr. Holmer, who says he has gotten used to sleeping only four or five hours a night, the computer operator has not had a day off in 74 days. #23 News Conferences After 23 news conferences in 74 days, Mr. Holmer is almost certainly better known to the Swedish public than Mr. Palme's successor, Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson. **********''I'm determined to stay here till we have caught him,'' he said. Rangy and still athletic at 55 years old, he was dressed informally in running shoes and a sports shirt with the sleeves rolled up. After the first month, he said, he was sometimes overcome by weariness had become used to the routine. **********Not taking any time off is his way of showing his men that he has not lost heart. ''If I would take time off now,'' he said, ''they might think, 'He doesn't believe in us.' '' A Hero to Many Swedes **********His complete identification with the investigation has made him a hero to many Swedes, who see him as a man striving to restore the ruptured sense of their country as a safe haven in a chaotic world. But it also makes him a potential scapegoat. This week Justice Minister Sten Wickbom said the Government would begin an investigation of the assassination and of the police investigation headed by Mr. Holmer. **********Under the Swedish system, Mr. Holmer has had considerable freedom to run the investigation his own way without answering to the Government on a daily basis. More outspoken than most Swedish civil servants and politicians here, he has said that an investigation of the investigators will only waste his valuable time. **********The newspapers like the idea, he said, because it will give them something new to cover. A few moments later he produced a carton filled with letters and cards of encouragement that he had received from the general public since the popular press started second guessing his investigation and pushing the idea that the killer or killers got away in the hours after the shooting because of confusion and errors on the part of the police. **********The letters, Mr. Holmer said, say two things: ''I think you're marvelous'' and ''We hate journalists.'' Coverage Enhances Reputation **********But the newspapers have also enhanced his already considerable standing, making an investigation that involved 300 officers full-time at its peak - now there are about 200, with plans to reduce the force to 75 - appear as a battle of wits between Sweden's best-known civil servant and the unknown assailant. **********An embarrassment for the commissioner was the decision by the Attorney General to release Ake Lennart Viktor Gunnarsson, the one person he had taken into custody in the killing. Mr. Gunnarsson was a teacher with links to rightwing movements and a history of bitter opposition to Olof Palme. **********The police have been able to show no more than that Mr. Gunnarsson was within several blocks of the killing shortly after it occurred and that he behaved erratically. **********Released nearly eight weeks ago, Mr. Gunnarsson was being questioned again this week and shown in police lineups. Although he has a precise memory for things that happened several years ago, he still says that he cannot recall details of his movements on the night of the slaying. About 90 Potential Suspects **********Although he has had the most attention in the newspapers, Mr. Gunnarsson is not the focus of the investigation, the commissioner said. Rather he is in a category of potential suspects who are being investigated that, according to a police source, includes about 90 people. **********Mr. Holmer would not say how many of them are foreign but he tacitly acknowledged that, with the passage of time, it seems less likely that outside terrorist groups were involved. **********In the first days of the investigation, he said, it was normal to focus on the possibility that foreign groups were involved since foreigners - Croatians, Kurds, the Red Army Faction - had been linked to all previous incidents of terrorism in Sweden. In the absence of the usual assertions, threats or new demands from such groups, it was normal now, he said, to imagine that it was a very professional international killer or a maniac. **********By now, the investigators have listed and attempted to check out every possibility, no matter how outlandish it appeared, that they or others have found it possible to imagine. **********Until a motive is found, it remains unclear whether the shot was aimed at Mr. Palme personally, or whether Swedish leaders might still be targets of an ongoing conspiracy. **********Even so, it is extraordinary to have so much information and so few hard leads about a violent crime on a main thoroughfare witnessed or partially witnessed by about 40 persons. **********Mr. Holmer said he would go on day after day until he had an answer. But it was suggested to him that an investigation that goes on without making headway cannot be continued indefinitely. If he failed to make a breakthrough, it was suggested, it was unlikely that he would be in the same room running his investigation a year from now. **********''You want to make a bet?'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/09/business/centers-plan-partnership.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Centers Plan Partnership", "print_headline": "Centers Plan Partnership", "body_text": " **********Community Psychiatric Centers, which operates a chain of 27 acute psychiatric hospitals and 62 dialysis centers, said it would ask its shareholders to approve a plan to change the company into a limited partnership. **********The proposal will convert Community's outstanding shares to limited partnership units on a one-for-one basis and will require a two-thirds vote for approval. **********''The fact that the limited partnership will not be required to pay corporate income taxes, coupled with lower rates of taxation applicable to individual investors under the new tax law, affords us a unique opportunity to bring additional value to our shareholders,'' Robert L.

That will end the present system under which the bank places annual ceilings on the volume of new loans that banks can make. **********Change in Requirements **********It was also announced that French banks will no longer need to maintain compulsory reserve requirements with the central bank on their lending. Instead, they face slightly higher reserve requirements on deposits and limits on the amount of long-term lending they may finance from short-term borrowing. **********The rationing of new bank credit that the new system will replace has been in use in France since 1974. Advocates of that approach to monetary control believed that it would restrain inflation while avoiding sharp interest rate fluctuations that could damage investment. The approach involved setting not only annual limits on new bank lending but also compulsory reserve requirements against the loans they made. **********Mr. Camdessus stressed that one positive result of today's credit changes would be to increase lending competition among French banks, which should encourage lower interest rates. But he acknowledged that interest rates could also become more volatile than in the past. 'Seriously Inefficient' **********The old system discouraged competition for loans by the annual loan limits it set. Mr. Camdessus described the old system as ''seriously inefficient,'' and said that ''there will be no tears at the Banque de France over this change.'' At the same time, he said the bank will seek a further tightening of French monetary policy next year in order to ''continue the process of disinflation'' and insure ''exchange rate stability.'' **********The central bank plans to concentrate on controlling two measurements of the money supply. It is setting a 4 percent to 6 percent growth target next year for the M-2 money supply, which measures cash and easily withdrawn bank deposits, and is currently growing at a 6.5 percent rate. It also aims to hold the growth of M-3, which is a broader money measurement and is now expanding at an annual rate of 5.2 percent, to between 3 percent and 5 percent. **********Today's overhaul marks the latest step in a process of financial deregulation started by the outgoing Socialist Government and intensified by the present conservative one. It complements the Government's parallel efforts to liberalize other aspects of the economy through the privatization of state-owned companies, relaxation of currency exchange and price controls and cuts in taxation. Charges for Checks **********However, another financial move is stirring up resentment. French consumer groups are outraged by an announcement by the Government that it will allow the country's nationalized banking system to charge for checking accounts next January. The Government proposal represents an attempt to increase the banks' profitability and make them more attractive to private buyers when it starts to denationalize them next year. **********Consumer organizations are urging customers to retaliate by writing checks on ordinary pieces of paper, which is legal in France, or by defacing the computerized codes on their checks. **********Meanwhile, Finance Minister Edouard Balladour has suspended the introduction of a new all-nickel 10-franc coin, worth about $1.50, in the face of a consumer outcry, The new coin is designed to facilitate the operation of coin-operated machinery. Pensioner organizations, however, have complained that the coin is easily mistaken by those with poor sight for the current 10-centimes coin, which has only one-hundredth the value of the new coin.

The Australian Embassy in Jakarta lodged a protest. **********Reporters traveling with Mr. Hawke in Europe this week said he appears to be unwilling to let the matter rest, although Jakarta reversed itself on the new tourist-visa rule after 24 hours, after an outcry from hoteliers. Australians' Old Fears **********Whether or not the immediate crisis recedes quickly, Australians say, it has already resurrected old fears here about the stability and political maturity of Indonesia. The same questions are being raised in Indonesia itself. **********The crisis has also exposed continuing divisions within Indonesia on how to deal with the foreign press, and foreign opinion in general. **********Reports from Jakarta say the heated reaction to the article on President Suharto - which appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald and was written by David Jenkins, the paper's foreign editor and a leading scholar on Indonesia - occurred when the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, was out of the country, attending a meeting of third-world leaders in New Delhi. Mr. Mochtar met with Australian journalists last December on a visit to Sydney and was well received. On April 14 this reporter's Indonesian visa was revoked by the Jakarta Government. No reasons were given for the action and no responses have been received to further inquiries. **********The Foreign Minister, who has been instrumental in generally opening Indonesia to the world as well as specifically improving relations with Australia, returned to Jakarta early this week and tried to control if not reverse the damage done over the barring of the Australians. The moves against Australians were reportedly made by President Suharto on advice of Justice Ministry and military officials. #2 Nations Long Wary The crisis shows, according to Paul Kelly, a columnist for the newspaper The Australian, that despite recent improvements, ''the wider basis for an effective relationship has not been established'' between the two nations. **********Relations between Australia, with about 15 million people, and Indonesia, with more than 160 million, have always been wary. Australians have seen Indonesia go through the upheaval of the Sukarno years, when neighboring Malaysia was attacked, and an attempted leftist-inspired coup in 1965. **********Ties suffered particular strains a decade ago when Jakarta annexed the former Portuguese territory of East Timor. A powerful pro-Timorese lobby, especially strong in Mr. Hawke's Labor Party, has only lately reduced the pitch of its criticism of Indonesia. **********Last summer Mr. Hawke said publicly that Australia recognized Indonesian sovereignty in East Timor. Canberra and Jakarta have begun discussions on developing offshore oil and gas resources in the waters between the two nations. **********Exchanges of ministers had become more frequent. Australian journalists began to gain access to Indonesia. Australians had begun developing a defense strategy that no longer assumed a potential threat from Indonesia. Suharto's Possible Worth **********Then, in advance of the Suharto-Reagan meeting, The Sydney Morning Herald began to print a series of articles on Indonesia under President Suharto, as did other major newspapers in the region. **********One article in The Sydney Morning Herald summarized the available information, much of it already known in Indonesia, about the business activities and possible worth - $2 billion to $3 billion, according to some estimates - of President Suharto and his family. Its publication brought what even Indonesians have described as an overreaction from military and some Government officials in Jakarta. **********Indonesian newspapers took up the cry of ''defamation,'' but apparently made no attempt at detailed rebuttals. Australia was chided in editorials and comments from Indonesian officials for a failure to understand the country or take its culture into account. ---- Journalists' Appeal Rejected HONOLULU, April 27 - Indonesia has rejected an appeal to let two Australian journalists enter the country with the Reagan entourage to cover the Bali meeting, the White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said today. **********Paul D. Wolfowitz, the new United States Ambassador to Jakarta, met several times with Indonesian officials to request that all the journalists who have been barred from the country be allowed to enter. But Mr. Speakes said Mr. Wolfowitz had been told that the Australian Broadcasting Company correspondents, Richard Palfreyman and Jim Middleton, would be barred at the border."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/24/business/morgan-may-soon-go-public.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1986-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 791, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MORGAN MAY SOON GO PUBLIC", "print_headline": "MORGAN MAY SOON GO PUBLIC", "body_text": " **********Morgan Stanley & Company, the investment banking house that traces its origins to the financial empire of J.

This would help Morgan Stanley compete with other major Wall Street houses. **********'Supply the Brains' **********Up to now, one source close to the company remarked, Morgan Stanley would ''supply the brains'' in Wall Street deals, in return for a fee and ''a piece of the action.'' However, this source said, other Wall Street houses are not only supplying the brains but also putting their money into ventures, so that they can get a bigger piece of the action. **********Morgan refused to comment officially on the long-expected move, but employees said that some department heads had told staff members as early as 9 A.M. yesterday that rumors about the plan were true. **********''They told us,'' said one employee who asked not to be identified, ''that there are only a few options to growth and that Morgan Stanley has no interest in shrinking or becoming a second-tier company and that the best way to raise capital was to sell stock.'' **********Another source close to the company said that Morgan Stanley was ''already doing pretty much what it wants to do,'' but that it was ''overextended on capital'' and ''wants to be more comfortable.'' Part of a Trend **********Only a few months ago, Bear, Stearns Companies Inc., another leading Wall Street house, sold about 25 percent of its stock to the public. And Alex. Brown Inc. of Baltimore, the oldest investment house in the country, is in the process of selling a third of its stock. **********Morgan Stanley's timing was viewed by analysts and employees as ideal, because brokerage stocks were advancing significantly for the first time in more than two years. **********While Morgan had initially planned to make its announcement Monday, word of the public offering became widespread yesterday, putting pressure on the firm to make the announcement earlier. **********Based on numerous reports from Morgan Stanley employees, a considerable number of low-level workers were told flatly early yesterday that the firm ''will go public.'' 'Unauthorized' Disclosure **********Insiders said that while some senior executives were ''supposed to have been told,'' the disclosure to low-level people was ''unauthorized.'' Sources said that Richard B. Fisher, president of the company, and others explained the plan to more than 100 senior executives in a two-and-a-half-hour session at the company's mid-Manhattan headquarters in the Exxon Building last night. **********One insider said that he had heard Morgan Stanley wanted to sell five million shares, while a few said they had heard the company was trying to raise as much as $200 million. **********Under the rules of the game, Morgan Stanley is not permitted to set the price it would get for its own stock. That would be determined by the other big Wall Street houses that would sell it to the public, along with Morgan Stanley itself. But insiders speculated that Morgan Stanley was thinking in terms of $40 a share. **********One Morgan employee, who also asked not to be named, said all stock being sold would be newly issued. This employee estimated that only 20 percent of the stock would be sold to the public, and each of Morgan's four top executives would receive stock worth at least $20 million. Rumors Around a While **********Rumors that Morgan was thinking of going public began circulating at least two months ago, when Bear, Stearns began meeting with investment people to tell them about its own plans to go public. **********Several money managers at one of the Bear, Stearns meetings, held in the Helmsley Palace hotel in Manhattan, seemed surprised at seeing Mr. Fisher, Morgan's 49-year-old president, and Lewis W. Bernard, 44, head of Morgan's finance, administration and operations unit, at the meeting. **********One source said it was normal for investment executives to attend such gatherings, but very unusual for top-level people to show up. The two executives are part of Morgan Stanley's four-man ruling committee, along with S. Parker Gilbert, 52, chairman, and Robert F.

''But you can't keep the kettle boiling all the time. I think we've got to realize that the economy might not return to a strong growth pattern for some time, possibly not until 1987.'' **********The Fed said that the May decline was ''widespread'' throughout the economy, reflecting both the continuing downturn in oil and gas production and lower output of cars and trucks, business equipment and such durable goods as appliances. Durable goods production fell 2 percent in May, while business equipment output was 1.1 percent below the April level. Gasoline and Food Costs Up **********In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the Producer Price Index climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in May, after a four-month decline, as gasoline and food prices rebounded.  [ Page 36. ]  Analysts attributed the weakness in industrial production to a reluctance by American businesses to maintain the high levels of inventories that had built up during the first quarter. In particular, auto inventories had swollen in expectation of stronger demand. But some suggested that a pickup in some basic economic components in May - especially housing starts and appliance sales - suggested that production would start to move up again. **********While the American economy now consists in large measure of services, which are reflected in the more broadly based economic indicators, such as the report on the gross national product, economists still generally find the activity of factories one of the more reliable measures of economic activity. Downward Two-Month Revision **********The drop in industrial production, which more than offset a rise in April of four-tenths of 1 percent, was accompanied by a substantial downward revision for February and March. **********The negative news on production comes after an earlier economic report for May - the report on the index of leading indicators - had shown enough strength to suggest that the second half of the year would see robust growth. But analysts noted that much of the strength of that report had reflected financial components such as stock prices, and did not speak to the prospects for the manufacturing sector. **********Economists said that the May decline in production indicated that second-quarter growth, as measured by the gross national product, would be no higher than 2 percent after adjusting for inflation, and most likely less. **********Earlier, a consensus forecast of 51 private economists compiled by Robert Eggert of Eggert Econometric Enterprises had predicted an annual growth rate of 2.7 percent for the second quarter and growth for the full year of almost 3.7 percent. The Reagan Administration has been forecasting 3.4 percent growth this year. **********The economists also noted that in the first quarter the economy was less healthy than the 3.7 percent growth in the G.N.P. for that period suggested, because some of that growth reflected the inventory buildup that is now deterring new orders. ''It is evident from all measures that the first quarter was not as strong as the numbers said and that future data will show that,'' said Alan Greenspan of Townsend-Greenspan in New York, who was chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Greenspan called the industrial production indicator a much more accurate barometer of the economy than the G.N.P. **********Mr. Greenspan also said that he saw little pickup in growth through at least the rest of the summer, despite the fact that interest rates are down, stock prices are up and profits are higher. ''The fact is, corporate balance sheets are not in good shape and there is considerable concern about borrowing money for new capital investment,'' he added. ''They're concerned they will be left with even higher levels of debt.'' **********However, not all economists were as negative. ''I think May is going to be the bottom of the current sluggishness,'' said Sam I. Nakagama, chief economist of Nakagama & Wallace Inc. in New York. ''While production is falling, final demand is picking up.'' He noted that, while the Fed said domestic production of cars and trucks fell to an annual rate of 7.6 million units, from 8.1 million in April and 8.7 million in February, sales rose to 8.23 million units in May from 8.05 million in April. **********''The three biggest components of the economy you can think of - cars, houses and appliances - were strong in May,'' Mr. Nakagama said.

McGarry Jr. that were destined to change the course of advertising history. **********At the time, the two were recent graduates of Immaculata and Villanova, respectively, and were what used to be called ''sweet on one another,'' having belonged to the same drama club and having appeared in a production of Laurence Housman's ''Victoria Regina.'' They were destined to marry and, for old times sake, name their first born, Victoria. It was a girl.  John McGarry, recognizing good advice, got into advertising and now, 49 years old, sits triumphantly in the president's post at Young & Rubicam/ New York, the largest and flagship unit in the world's largest advertising agency. He calls it ''the mother lode.'' **********''I never dreamed I'd be where I am today,'' he said in his office earlier this week, ''It's kind of humbling.'' **********He's been in the job for just about a year now (''a fabulous year''), moving into it from managing director of the New York office.

He rules from the sixth floor - the same high-command floor he timidly used to try to get past as fast as possible when he was in print traffic, shepherding ads through the agency back in 1965.

That system was designed to replay live television performances at different times. Like early computers, the taping equipment was huge and unwieldy. **********Last night Ampex, now a subsidiary of the Allied Corporation, got two new Emmys from the Academy for its newest tape processor and portable camera/recorder - devices that would have been unimaginable to the videotape pioneers of the 1950's. **********''Video technology is moving at a very rapid pace,'' said Steven Bonica, vice president in charge of engineering at the National Broadcasting Company. **********The driving force, just as in the computer industry, has been the increasing power, declining cost and shrinking size of chips. Ampex's new tape processor, for instance, has more than 1,000 integrated circuits. These allow it to compress or expand videotaped material so that a program can be lengthened or shortened by several minutes without viewers perceiving any difference. **********A videotaped program is actually a sequence of images that change 30 times a second. The processor uses information from the master tape to compose new frames that are inserted into the copied tape in place of the original frames - in essence composing a slightly different version of scenes recorded by the camera. If the processed tape winds up with more frames than the original, the program takes longer to broadcast. If fewer frames result, the showing time has been compressed. **********As a result, programs can be condensed to allow maximum time for commercials without appearing to be speeded up. Or programs can be expanded to fill out the alloted time on noncommercial stations without appearing to be slowed down. **********Ampex is not the only company making technical waves in video. As consumers have learned when shopping for home video recorders, there is more than one way to handle a television signal, and the different methods or formats are usually incompatible. A variety of European, American and Japanese companies are marketing a broad, frequently changing menu of options. **********Companies ranging from Japanese consumer-product giants (such as Sony, JVC and Matsushita) to high-technology specialists (such as Britain's Quantel, which makes graphics processing systems) all won Emmys along with Ampex last night. **********People in the industry see unprecedented room for technical competition in coming years. Among the battles are these: *********** Composite vs. component. The color television camera produces red, blue and green signals of varying intensity. Typically they are merged into a single composite signal on tape. That signal is frequently broken down into its original components for processing. A typical television program may go through as many as 15 generations of taping. Errors creep in each time, so the quality of the tape goes down and down. Some new recording and processing systems avoid using a composite signal until a final tape is made for broadcast. *********** Digital vs. analog. The typical television signal is an analog wave that varies according to what is in the image. That wave can be chopped up into little pieces that can be labeled digitally - that is, by a combination of 1's and 0's. Digital recording requires more tape (or packing information more densely on tape) but makes it possible to locate and fix errors that can degrade quality. It also allows more freedom in special effects work. *********** Tape size. Commonly used tape widths in various consumer and professional formats vary today from one-half inch to one inch. The narrower tapes, pioneered in consumer applications, are expanding into the broadcast sector as their performance improves. NBC, for example, is shifting the bulk of its 3/4-inch and one-inch recording and processing work to a 1/2-inch analog component format developed by Matsushita in a challenge to Sony and Ampex's leadership position in the $2 billion broadcast market. **********Finally, videotape itself is evolving as suppliers and major consumers search for ways to make the tape surface record more information in less space. Tape consists of a polyester ribbon covered with a surface that is magnetized by the recorder in patterns that represent images. Videotape players read these magnetic patterns and reconstruct the signal, which they convey to the television screen. **********The newest tape has a surface with particles of pure iron. They are coated with plastics or other substances to keep them from contact with the air. Tape manufacturers are continually looking for metal compounds that would be cheaper, more stable and just as convenient for recording the magnetic information."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/23/business/pepper-prices-advance.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pepper Prices Advance", "print_headline": "Pepper Prices Advance", "body_text": " **********A shortage of white pepper supplies from main producers is putting spice into prices, which have jumped sharply this week, brokers said.

Previously, it had frozen the wages of its 5,000 employees, pared operating budgets by $70 million and trimmed its payroll by 10 percent. **********''We've done all the wringing out that we can,'' said E. Linn Draper, president. ''It is absolutely vital to have rate increases in Texas and Louisiana - and in a timely fashion.'' **********With headquarters in Beaumont, Tex. - the heart of the Southwest's petrochemical and refining region -Gulf States provides 550,000 customers with electricity along the Gulf of Mexico in southern Louisiana and within 60 miles of Austin in Texas. Dim Outlook for Rate Rise **********The utility has not won a rate increase in Louisiana since 1982 nor in Texas since 1984, and the prospects for one in either state this year are slim. In Louisiana, two of the five utility regulators are up for re-election in September; in Texas, all three commissioners were appointed by Gov. Mark White, a Democrat, who is running for re-election in November. **********Gulf States says that unless regulators decide to go against public opinion and grant higher rates, it will lose $1.5 billion through 1990 - enough to wipe out most of its $1.7 billion net worth. **********Although the utility reported a $48.9 million profit for the quarter ended June 30, it maintains that the black ink was illusory, because it included $61.3 million in future credits approved by the rate commissions but not yet paid. **********Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation lowered their ratings for much of Gulf State's debt to speculative grades earlier this summer. The utility says it will lose $300 million in the first half of 1987 if rates are not raised. **********''It's obvious to us that the company is deeply in need of additional rate relief,'' said Richard J. Spletzer, head of the public utility research division of Duff & Phelps, in Chicago. ''Now it's a question of when and how much.'' Utility's Planning Blamed **********Critics in Texas and Louisiana portray Gulf States as a victim of its own poor planning - flaws they say are manifested in the new $4.4 billion River Bend nuclear plant. **********The plant, situated along a scenic bend of the Mississippi River in eastern Louisiana, was projected to cost $1.7 billion when construction began in August 1979. It has been producing electricity at close to 100 percent of its 940-megawatt capacity since May, and it has passed all tests required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. **********Gulf States has asked the Texas Public Utility Commission for an additional $202 million over three years, a 26 percent increase, to cover the huge operating costs at River Bend. The Texas commission will hear arguments on the request Sept. 2, but a ruling could be months away. Filing Called 'Premature' **********The Louisiana Public Service Commission threw out the utility's proposal for a $360 million rate increase soon after its filing last June. The regulators said the request was ''premature,'' because it included River Bend costs. The commission said it would not act until after the Texas commission rules. **********''I don't look for the prospect of the company getting substantial rate relief,'' said Louis S. Quinn, chief administrator of the Louisiana commission. Large industrial users, he said, adamantly oppose higher rates. **********Mr. Quinn and other regulators say Gulf States badly overestimated future power demand when it set out a decade ago to increase its generating capacity. They say the penalty should be paid by the utility's stockholders, not its customers. **********Others worry that a rate increase would force more refineries, chemical plants, steel mills and other industrial customers to abandon the Gulf States power grid, and buy electricity elsewhere. That would leave residential customers shouldering a larger share of the utility's excess capacity and rising operating costs. Industrial customers accounted for 47 percent of Gulf States demand last year. Audit Finds 'Challenges' **********Consultants to the Texas Public Utility Commission concluded, after a seven-month management audit of the utility, that Gulf States ''faces enormous challenges.'' The report, by Temple, Barker & Sloane Inc. of Lexington, Mass., was delivered last February, before tumbling energy prices intensified the region's recession. Louisiana's June unemployment rate, 13.6 percent, was the highest in all 50 states. **********Utility analysts say the regional economic woes would be compounded if Gulf States remains hobbled for years. ''You need a viable electric utility to bring in industry,'' said Mr. Spletzer of Duff & Phelps. **********He believes regulators in Texas and Louisiana eventually will allow Gulf States enough revenue to cover operating costs. On the other hand, it could be years before the political climate cools and Gulf States again pays a dividend, he said. **********Herbert M. Jones, a senior vice president with Eppler, Guerin & Turner Inc. in Dallas, said that until a healthy dividend is restored, Gulf States will find hard going when it has to raise capital. Misjudgment in Mid-1970's **********Dr. Draper of Gulf States, a nuclear physicist with a doctoral degree from Cornell University, agrees that the utility badly misjudged anticipated power demand. Still, he said, it was an honest mistake amid what appeared in the middle 1970's to be a looming power shortage in the region. **********Harold F. Perla, general manager of a California consulting concern, Pickard, Lowe & Garrick Inc., agreed in written testimony prepared for the Texas commission that the ambitious building plans of Gulf States were reasonable, ''based on the information available at the time each decision was made.'' **********Gulf States generated its power solely from natural gas through the 1970's. Congress required it to diversify to other fuel sources after serious natural gas shortages spread across the Middle West during the winter of 1977. Meanwhile, demand for power in the Gulf States service area had grown an average of more than 10 percent a year for nearly 30 years. **********The utility's thrust for new capacity cost $4.1 billion in construction spending during the last seven years. Coal-fired generating plants were finished in 1982 and 1984, followed by the River Bend plant early this year. Additional Costs Required **********Much of the extra costs at River Bend, the utility says, came from safety specifications ordered by regulators after the reactor accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. Pickard, Lowe & Garrick called River Bend ''one of the more successful nuclear plant projects'' built in the United States in the last 20 years. **********Still, the Cajun Electric Power Cooperative of Baton Rouge, which acquired 30 percent of River Bend after construction began, is unhappy. ''We are not thrilled by the reality of costs nearly three times'' higher than Gulf States projected, said Todd Tarbox, director of public affairs. **********This whirl of construction increased the total capacity of Gulf States to a peak of 6,692 megawatts at the end of June, compared with 4,851 in 1978. Demand slipped, though, because of the weak economy. The heaviest load this year was 5,200 megawatts in July, compared with a peak of 5,604 in 1980. **********While the River Bend plant was being built, Gulf States envisioned oil prices rising to $60 a barrel and natural gas costing more than $12 a thousand cubic feet by the late 1980's. Pricing Pattern Changed **********It calculated that customers would save $22 billion over River Bend's estimated life of 30 years. But today, with oil close to $15 a barrel and natural gas below $2 a thousand cubic feet, Dr. Draper gives no assurances. **********He is still convinced, he said, that River Bend will have proved ''a good deal for the customer'' when the nuclear plant is mothballed sometime in the 21st century. ''It is not a good deal in the short term,'' he acknowledged. **********The 26 percent rate increase Gulf States says it needs would lift a residential customer's monthly bill for 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity to $86.26, compared with the current bill of $68.46. Consolidated Edison says its customers in New York City will pay $143.08 this month for that much electricity. The average comparable bill for utility customers across the nation was $72.41 last January, the latest figure available, according to the Edison Electric Institute. **********Despite its precarious financial state, Gulf States may find consolation in history: Since the Depression, no investor-owned utility has been allowed to go bankrupt."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/02/business/taking-advantage-of-the-law-s-fine-points-irs-tries-to-reduce-paper-load.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1986-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 401, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taking Advantage Of the Law's Fine Points; I.R.S.

In a telephone call to The Associated Press, he said he was confident the Sandinistas were telling Mr. Hasenfus that if he said what they wanted to hear, he would be ''out in no time,'' but that if he did not cooperate, he would be ''in prison for 30 years.'' **********General Singlaub, when asked who sponsored the mission, answered: ''I wish I knew.''

Dropping earlier denials, the Nicaraguan Government now acknowledges having attacked main rebel base camps on the border, and it reports heavy casualties on both sides. **********Sandinista units hit the main rebel bases inside Honduras just north of the towns of Arenales and Las Trojes and seized a rebel airstrip on the border 40 miles farther north during attacks this week, according to well-placed sources here with access to intelligence reports.

Their account was supported by well-placed sources here. The sources are not Honduran and have been briefing reporters all week on the Sandinista attack. **********The Administration and the sources characterized the attack as the biggest Sandinista border incursion ever.

The diplomat said American intelligence sources gave a similar figure. A Honduran political analyst who follows the Army closely said Honduran Army officers did not think more than 900 Sandinistas were involved in the attack. Reassuring the Hondurans **********A Western diplomat said President Reagan had sent the $20 million in emergency military assistance not so much to repel the Sandinista attack as to reassure the Honduran military of American willingness to support Honduras in the event of a Sandinista attack on rebel bases. Honduras officially does not admit the bases are in the country. **********It appears the Sandinista attack was directed only against guerrilla bases, according to a diplomatic observer here. No Hondurans are known to have died in the fighting. **********In addition, the attack may not have been much larger than a similar Sandinista assault last May against the main rebel base of Las Vegas, inside Honduras. Unlike the incursion this week, the attack last year was given almost no publicity by Honduran or American officials. **********A source with access to intelligence reports told journalists today that elements of three Sandinista battalions took part in the attack on rebel bases this week and that elements of two other Sandinista units tried to cross the border but were stopped within a mile by rebel forces. The Sandinista attack was supported by rocket barrages that failed to reach the main rebel bases, the source said. #16 Sandinistas Reported Captured He added 16 Sandinistas had been taken prisoner by Nicaraguan rebels and were being questioned. The source estimated that at least 1,000 Sandinista soldiers had attacked the rebel bases. **********The source could not confirm casualty figures given to journalists here that indicate 200 Sandinistas and 40 rebels died in the attack. The source said the figures had been provided by the rebels, who have often been highly inaccurate in their accounts of battles with Nicaraguan units. **********The source added, however, that Sandinista troops had reached the inner perimeter of the main rebel training school inside Honduras in four different assaults, which appears to indicate that both Sandinista and rebel casualties were probably high. The description given by this source, whose job includes compiling and analyzing intelligence reports about the Sandinista attack on the main rebel base of Las Vegas last May, appears to show an incursion of very nearly the same intensity and size. Earlier Attack Described **********In the earlier attack, the source said, elements of five Sandinista battalions entered Honduras. Rebel sources say the Sandinistas reached the rebels' main camp and several hundred Sandinista rockets hit rebel positions, killing several guerrillas. **********Asked about what was apparently the similarity in the size of the two Sandinista attacks, a well-placed source who has been briefing journalists said the attack this week was ''somewhat larger.'' **********According to sources here who are in contact with the Honduran Army, 750 Honduran soldiers are now on the border to prevent further Sandinista incursions. The stepped-up Honduran military presence was made possible by several American helicopter flights ferrying Honduran troops to the border. **********The sources said that virtually all Sandinista soldiers had returned to Nicaragua but that some stragglers remained inside Honduras and were being sought by Honduran forces.

Two paintings that he did at the request of the project's developers hang on the studio wall, and are indicated by yellow markings on the plans. **********Mr. Webster is one of three French-American artists who have been commissioned to create works for Centrum. ''Commissioning art is like buying custom-made clothes,'' he said. ''Corporations like the idea that the art is created specifically for them, that it's made for their needs.'' **********According to art consultants, developers and corporations building headquarters are placing as much emphasis on art in a new building's interior as on the look of the building's exterior. In fact, they are asking artists to coordinate with the architects and designers in the planning stages. **********''In the beginning, art was really an afterthought,'' said Joyce Crieger, president of Crieger Associates, a Boston-based art consulting firm. ''Now the art is being conceived at almost the same time as the architecture. Art is now being incorporated into the building instead of being added to it.'' **********Jerry Allen, director of cultural affairs for the city of Dallas, suggests that developments in the public sector have influenced the business world. Twenty-two states and close to 100 cities have laws that require public builders to contribute a fixed percentage of their construction costs to put art in the building's public spaces. In fact, commissioning art for public places is now common practice, and the private sector, says Mr. Allen, ''has picked up the lead that was taken by the public sector.'' **********The Hurd Development Company and the Argosy Development Company, the Centrum developers, are together spending $400,000 on a series of art commissions that will include a 21-foot sculpture of black twisted steel by Bernar Venet, Mr. Webster's paintings, and a 64-foot wall mural by Arman B. Arman. **********''Almost everything we do is commissioned,'' said Robert Lintault, manager of the Centrum project. ''We're trying to tie in the work with the concept of the building, and it's very hard to do that with works that have already been done. It's like fitting a square peg into a round hole.'' **********The $7 million that the Equitable Life Assurance Society spent on commissions by such pre-eminent artists as Roy Lichtenstein, Sandro Chia and Sol LeWitt was parceled out mainly with esthetics in mind, says the company's art curator, Pari Choate. Artists worked with the architect, she said. ''We want the space and the art to be thought of together in the very spirit of the renaissance,'' she added. **********But Mr. Lintault also pointed out that commissioning art is a lucrative business venture. He said that custom-made art not only helps a developer ''to get a leg up on the competition, by making its projects stand apart,'' but also brings with it the type of prestige that can attract tenants - of paramount importance in high-vacancy Dallas. ''Everyone buys art,'' he said, ''but commissioning a world-famous artist to produce a work specifically for our project is certainly newsworthy,'' he added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/03/business/asbestos-suit-gain-by-schools.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1986-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 461, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ASBESTOS SUIT GAIN BY SCHOOLS", "print_headline": "ASBESTOS SUIT GAIN BY SCHOOLS", "body_text": " **********A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, has unanimously ruled that schools can now decide for themselves whether to join in huge class action suits for damages against asbestos producers or sue on their own, raising complaints from asbestos lawyers that numerous schools will choose to sue individually. **********The ruling is viewed as a setback for the asbestos companies since it raises the prospect that these companies will have to defend themselves repeatedly - and at great cost -against individual schools rather than at one time in one big case that they could possibly settle out of court. **********In Knoxville, Tenn., Michael Y.

Gilfredo Geolingo, the police chief here, when he drove from his house Tuesday. **********The gunmen, members of a recently formed unit called the Armed City Partisans, riddled his car with automatic weapons fire, killing the colonel and his driver. Then they calmly drove off down the main street in a truck. **********''He owed a blood debt to the people,'' said Ka Joyce, or Comrade Joyce, the senior Communist Party political commissar for the island of Negros, of which Bacolod is the capital. 'Repressing the People' **********''He persisted in repressing the people despite repeated warnings and was responsible for many salvagings,'' Ka Joyce said, using a Filipino term for atrocities by Government soldiers and the police. **********The bold daylight killing, in a major city, reflects the rapid growth of the Communist insurgency in the Philippines in the last few years. **********Until about 1980 the New People's Army, the military arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines, was considered only an annoyance, a small band of guerrillas fighting in isolated mountainous areas. In the opinion of many Filipinos and American diplomats, it has now emerged as the country's dominant long-term problem. **********There is wide agreement that the Communists have already created a new power center in the Philippines, in some ways rivaling the country's traditional major institutions: the Government, the Roman Catholic Church and more recently the army. Unless the Communists suddenly reverse political course, authorities here say, they will pose a serious threat to President Corazon C. Aquino's efforts to revive the economy and restore democracy. **********With a flexible strategy loosely based on Mao Zedong's precept of using the countryside to surround the cities and exploiting widespread popular discontent, the Communists have fashioned a nationwide network that mixes so-called liberated zones in the villages with safe houses, secret party cells and clandestine couriers in the cities. **********All figures about the Communists are somewhat hazy and should be treated with caution. But by one American estimate, the New People's Army controls 20 percent of the archipelago's 40,000 villages. The Communists have installed shadow governments in a number of towns that remain nominally under the Government, including some close to the large American naval base at Subic Bay on the Bataan Peninsula. By American count, there are now 20,000 guerrillas. The Communists say they have 30,000 men under arms. **********''We could have 10,000 more, but there is a shortage of arms and a long waiting list,'' Ka Joyce said. **********The National Democratic Front, a Communist umbrella organization of peasant, worker, church and women's groups, claims a membership of one million. And Bayan, a legal united front organization that many Filipino moderates assert is really controlled by the Communists, has another 2.3 million members. **********In the last few years, especially since the popular protests after the assassination of Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno S. Aquino Jr., in 1983, the Communists' organization in the cities has developed as fast as their older activities in the countryside. 'Going to the Hills' **********Many of the nation's brightest, most dedicated and often wealthiest young people have rushed to join them, including students, professors, doctors, business executives, priests and even beauty queens. ''Going to the hills'' to join the New People's Army became a fashionable trend in the years of President Ferdinard E. Marcos's rule, much like radical chic in the United States in the late 1960's. **********''The N.P.A. may have a higher percentage of really smart leaders than any other Communist movement,'' an American military analyst said. **********Some Filipinos believe that the Communists will not succeed. They point to the example of this week, when the unpopular, ineffective Marcos Government was peacefully ousted by hundreds of thousands of people supporting Mrs. Aquino. The phenomenon, they contend, suggests that moderates in the Philippines retain great appeal and power. **********''I think the Communists will now wither away,'' said Joker Arroyo, a civil liberties lawyer who defended many men accused by Mr. Marcos of being Communists and who has been appointed executive secretary in President Aquino's new Government. ''They are containable.'' 'Armed Struggle' to Go On **********But the Communists assert they will continue their basic strategy of ''armed struggle.'' **********''You may see some different faces in the Government, but the same repressive system remains in place,'' said Ka Joyce, who was one of the founding members of the Communist Party in 1968. **********It is too early to tell which assertion will prove more correct. It is not even certain whether Mrs. Aquino will honor her campaign pledge to begin a six-month cease-fire with the New People's Army. Her senior military advisers have called for stepping up the war. **********According to the Philippine military, the New People's Army killed 144 Government officials and 1,203 civilians last year, although the poorly trained army of 230,000 men may have lost nearly 5,000 men killed or wounded, an American official believes. Taxes Paid to Rebels **********With the insurgency growing rapidly, the Philippine military has been unable to protect large parts of this nation of scattered islands. **********A Manila businessman said he regularly pays taxes to the New People's Army on his timber land in Mindanao. ''It started about three years ago,'' he recalled. ''They write polite handwritten letters asking for 'help for the cause.' **********''They do their homework very well, and don't ask for too much, because if they overtaxed us and put us out of business, the workers would lose their jobs and the N.P.A. would lose its mass base.'' **********He is assessed the equivalent of 50 cents for each cubic meter of log production, well below his selling price of $70 per cubic meter. He also makes contributions of food and shoes, according to the letters he receives, which are forwarded by workers in his company who are Communists. 'Too Dangerous Not to Pay' **********Last year the New People's Army overran the outpost of the paramilitary Philippine constabulary in the town where his company is situated and killed all 20 soldiers, including the commanding officer. ''So it is too dangerous not to pay them,'' the businessman said. **********''It is really a revolutionary situation, when you add in the poverty, corruption and military atrocities,'' said Antonio J. Fortich, the Bishop of Bacolod. **********By the estimate of one of his parish priests, who is a Communist, 40 percent of the priests and 60 percent of the nuns in the Bacolod area are Communist sympathizers, and many belong to a shadowy illegal organization called Christians for National Liberation. **********The Communists' progress has been made easier by the army's resorting to kidnappings, beatings and killings. **********The Rev. Ireneo Gordoncillo, a priest in Bacolod who keeps track of military abuses, said he did not monitor incidents of violence by the New People's Army. ''Probably the army does,'' he said. ''I only document those cases which people bring to me to try to get justice.'' Random Brutality **********One of the questions being asked with increasing frequency in recent months is whether, as the New People's Army expands and feels more secure, it too has resorted to random brutality. **********''I think they are beginning to change,'' said Bishop Fortich, whose 200-year-old house was burned by the army last year because it suspected him of collaborating with the New People's Army. ''I have peasants coming to me to say they are terrified of the N.P.A. now, that they are killing civilians, not just soldiers and police. And they are starting to tax their own supporters more heavily.'' **********The Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, a New York-based organization, contended in a report last December that the Communists were responsible for a growing number of killings of Government officials, beatings of people who refused to pay their taxes and the slayings of villagers they suspected might inform on them. **********Ka Joyce denied the charge. ''I watched 'The Killing Fields' on my VCR and it scared me too,'' he said, sitting in the home of a wealthy local businessman who has befriended the Communists. ''What the Khmer Rouge did was despicable. What is the point of joining the revolution, of fighting for democracy, if you are going to do that sort of thing?'' In Revenge for Atrocities **********He insisted that the only killing the New People's Army did was in revenge for Government atrocities. Last September, for instance, 27 demonstrators were shot and killed by soldiers in front of the city hall in the town of Escalante. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, now Chief of Staff in Mrs. Aquino's new Government, ordered an investigation, but no one has been prosecuted. **********So the New People's Army compiled its own list of the guilty, Ka Joyce said. Three men have been killed so far, one this month as he got off a bus in Bacolod to buy cigarettes. The rebel group has also put up posters in the central market in Bacolod, saying, ''Wanted, Dead or Alive,'' for the Mayor of Escalante, the provincial Governor and the army general in command at the time of the massacre. **********For some reason, the Government has not taken the posters down. Ka Joyce, who now lives a virtually normal existence in Bacolod - staying in one home for long periods of time and traveling by public transportation -thinks it is because the army is ''very sloppy.'' **********In this predominantly Roman Catholic country, where the reverence for clerics was demonstrated over the last few days by their ability to stop troops loyal to President Marcos from attacking rebel officers, the Communists have benefited enormously from having priests and nuns allied with them. 'A Moral Voice' **********''It gives them a moral voice and a way to reach the people they wouldn't otherwise have,'' said the Rev. John Carroll, the director of the Institute for Church and Social Issues at the Ateneo de Manila University, a Jesuit-run school. **********But the Communist Party of the Philippines, which was formed by a group of 11 young professors and students who broke away from the old Moscow-oriented Partido Komunista Ng Pilinpas, founded in 1930, has made mistakes of its own. Impressed by the Cultural Revolution in China, the party tried to carry out Mao's theories in the Philippines, only to discover that the country's islands were too small to allow for safe base areas, like Mao's cave headquarters at Yenan. **********''We thought it would be easy, just plug in the Maoist model,'' Ka Joyce said. Instead, under the leadership of Jose Maria Sison, a brilliant philosophy teacher at the University of the Philippines, the Communists gradually devised a strategy to take advantage of the dispersed nature of the country. **********The concept was to spread out all around the Philippines and prevent the Government forces from concentrating in one area, as they had been able to do against the earlier Communist Huk army in central Luzon in the late 1940's. **********''The key was to be flexible, not to try to hold a base area when the enemy advanced,'' Ka Joyce said. Buildup in Mindanao **********At the same time, the Communists built up their forces in Mindanao, the least developed part of the Philippines, drawing Government troops away from the cities and chewing them up in a kind of operation reminiscent of North Vietnamese tactics in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. **********In the last few years, with Mao's policies on the eclipse in China and Peking supporting the continued presence of American bases in the Philippines as a buffer against Soviet military expansion, the Philippine Communists have begun to study the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. **********''Nicaragua is a Catholic country like the Philippines, and the Sandinistas made good use of a broad united front combined with armed struggle,'' Ka Joyce said. **********The Philippine Communists' efforts to build a united front has run into trouble in the last year, however. Last spring, when Bayan was formed, some Communists manipulated the voting for the Executive Council by secretly distributing two different lists of names, according to Mr. Arroyo, President Aquino's executive secretary. As a result, their own candidates won the choice spots, he charged, including the appointment of the relatively unknown Lean Alejandro, 25 years old, as secretary general. **********Mr. Arroyo and a number of other moderates then pulled out of Bayan in protest. Boycott of Election **********Mr. Arroyo and other supporters of Mrs. Aquino were further alienated when Bayan and the Communists decided to boycott the presidential election Feb. 7 because she refused to accept their demand for a platform that included the removal of the American bases from the Philippines, a far-reaching land program and a repudiation of the Philippines' $26.5 billion foreign debt. **********''The Communists have become very dogmatic,'' Mr. Arroyo asserted. ''It's a pity, because they have fought longer and suffered many more casualties to get rid of Marcos than the rest of us.'' **********But around Bacolod, in Negros, the Communists have enjoyed a major success, their fastest growth of any area in the Philippines. **********The 300,000 sugar cane workers here have long been among the poorest people in the country, living on haciendas run like feudal baronries. When the world market price for sugar collapsed in 1980 and then Mr. Marcos handed over control of the sugar industry to several of his cronies, the island's economic plight worsened. **********The average wage of those sugar cane workers still employed is 15 pesos a day, about 60 cents at the black market exchange rate, or less than the amount required to buy enough rice to feed a typical family of six, said Jerry Dagoob, the deputy secretary general of the National Federation of Sugar Workers. Widespread Malnutrition **********A study by Unicef last fall found that 64 percent of the children in Bacolod were suffering from malnutrition. **********A local priest who is a member of the outlawed Christians for National Liberation said that confronted with these problems, ''an analysis teaches us that a moderate line isn't adequate.'' He added, ''We educate people through the Bible to realize their plight, and then they can see the need for militant armed struggle to get rid of the imperialist rule that is the root of the problem.'' **********The priest, the offspring of a wealthy Manila family who dresses in designer sports shirts and shoes, said he drew his inspiration from the liberation theology evolved by Catholic priests in Latin America. ''The biblical reference is in Exodus, when Yahweh hears the cries of the Israelites in bondage in Egypt and sends Moses to free them from the Pharaoh,'' he said. **********The priest said he sometimes met with New People's Army leaders, helped arrange medical treatment for guerrillas and passed on messages for party members. Gains on the Island **********Amid this poverty and with help from clerics, the New People's Army has made rapid strides on Negros. **********Six mayors of towns in the southern part of the island have abandoned their posts and are now living in Bacolod. Rebel organizers hold nightly teach-ins in the houses of sugar workers virtually within the city limits, said Jose Maria Locsin, a wealthy plantation owner of Chinese descent whose ancestors received a land grant from the Spanish throne two centuries ago. **********Out in the canefields that run in a long wave of green from Bacolod up to Kanlaon, a 4,000-foot active volcano, Bernie Jayman, an organizer for the sugar workers' union, believes a real revolution, not just a transfer of power from Mr. Marcos to Mrs. Aquino, is inevitable. ''In time,'' he said, glancing up at the mountain, ''the social volcano will erupt too.'"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/03/business/briefs-506986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 203, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Amoco Corp., Chicago, said it would sell its 16 percent stake in Analog Devices Inc. of Norwood, Mass. *********** C.O.M.B.

Sir James said that he had received firm commitments for financing from Merrill Lynch and a consortium of banks. **********He said that later on Tuesday he received an opinion from investment bankers that the company's restructuring program would ''result in a value of $50 to $60 a share.'' **********''I have always said that if the company could restructure itself where it would have a value past $50 we would be totally supportive,'' he said. Legislative Moves **********Sir James also said that the decision to sell his stake was influenced by anti-takeover legislation being drafted in Ohio's Legislature. The legislation would allow Ohio companies to issue to third parties, without shareholder approval, new shares with special voting rights. It would also give corporate directors the right to lend company money to potential acquirers to finance the purchase of these special shares. **********''We carefully evaluated our options against the background of the proposed Ohio legislation and determined that we had no other alternative but to agree to the company's proposal that it repurchase our shares,'' Sir James said. **********Analysts speculated that, apart from the sizable profit, Sir James might also have have been prompted to sell by the plunge early this week in the stocks of companies involved or believed to be involved in takeovers. Those stocks tumbled in response to the insider-trading scandal involving the arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky. Stock's Gyrations **********Goodyear's stock, which had been trading around $48 last week, dropped below $42 earlier this week. Yesterday, it closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $43, up $1.25. **********Sir James paid an average of $42.20 each for his shares. In early October, before Goodyear was considered a takeover target, its shares had traded in the mid-$30's. After Sir James announced his intentions to make a bid for the company, the stock reached as high as $50. **********Sir James denied that the insider-trading scandal had a direct impact on his agreement, but he said the situation ''created an emotional environment and an atmosphere that was very hostile'' to takeovers. **********The reaction to Sir James's campaign for Goodyear was often heated and was not confined to corporate board rooms. During games at high school football stadiums in Ohio, company employees sought signatures on petitions protesting his efforts. And in the halls of Congress earlier this week, Mr. Mercer and Sir James squared off before a packed hearing on the effects of corporate takeovers. **********Mr. Mercer yesterday repeated the complaints about corporate raiders that he had expressed in the Congressional hearing. ''These guys come out of nowhere, buy a lot of your stock, cash it in and walk away with the profits,'' he said. ''And you're left to pick up the pieces and put them together again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/22/world/protestants-in-ulster-unite-with-catholics-in-a-protest.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Protestants in Ulster Unite With Catholics in a Protest", "print_headline": "Protestants in Ulster Unite With Catholics in a Protest", "body_text": " **********Northern Ireland government workers, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, walked off their jobs today to protest threats against Catholics by Protestant paramilitary groups. **********In Lisburn, Conty Antrim, the government health and welfare office closed after Protestants walked out in solidarity with Catholic colleagues who had been warned not to go into Protestant areas.

Yet some analysts are convinced that this is the period for selective buying of stocks that have been battered recently and, now selling at attractive prices, appear to be poised for an upturn. **********Of course, optimism about the market outlook has long been the prevailing mood in the financial community, where recommendations to buy are far more frequent than recommendations to sell. But some of the researchers who follow the market on a daily basis believe that the drop of almost 121 points in the Dow Jones industrial average last Thursday and Friday has created many meaningful buying opportunities. **********''Last week's decline is an expression of the market having run ahead of the reality of the economy,'' said Monte Gordon, vice president and director of research of the Dreyfus Corporation. ''The market thinks that inflation is coming with a bang, but this is probably exaggerated and overdrawn. I would now make commitments in small amounts in quality companies.'' **********Noting that no industry leadership - or group of stocks whose rise leads the overall market higher - has emerged out of the recent price plunge, Mr. Gordon added that there were nevertheless certain fields worthy of investor attention these days. Among them, he cited the forest product, chemical and drug industries. ''This is the time to emphasize good cash flow, good balance sheets, quality management and a product that is proven,'' he said. **********Mr. Gordon said that International Paper and Great Northern Nekoosa were among the forest product stocks worthy of consideration. He mentioned American Cyanamid and Du Pont in the chemical industry and Merck and Squibb in the drug industry as possibilities for those with cash available for current investments. **********Stanley D. Salvigsen, chief investment strategist of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, is also looking at specific stocks as purchase possibilities in this period of overall market malaise. As he sees it, despite the present corrective phase of the market, there are a number of ways that investors who take the time to investigate the fundamentals can take advantage of present conditions. **********''The volatility and magnitude of the decline last week was headline-grabbing stuff,'' he said. ''But I would use any further corrections in the market to accumulate more of the cyclical stocks.'' **********Cyclical stocks are those that tend to rise quickly when the economy moves higher and fall quickly when the economy moves down. Mr. Salvigsen was referring particularly to companies in the basic industries - which he also termed beleaguered industries - those strong in manufacturing capital goods and heavy in technology. ''These stocks turn out to be the perceived losers under tax reform, but we feel that they are good values,'' he said. **********Mr. Salvigsen's choices of representative issues include I.B.M., Caterpillar, Cooper Industries and Westvaco. ''Given where the valuations were, the cyclical stocks are cheap,'' he said. ''Even with the decline, many of the cyclicals didn't get down to their lows of this summer.'' **********A somewhat different approach was taken by Richard Schmidt, vice president and director of research of Advest Inc. According to Mr. Schmidt, ''if you were to classify the over-the-counter market as an industry, it would be one I'd now be interested in.'' **********The reason for this interest, he said, is that ''these stocks with a capitalization below $200 million tend to react very negatively to fear.'' He added, ''We're seeing the fear phase here, and I like to buy low and sell high.'' **********With the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks having dropped 8.35 percent last week - a larger falloff than any of the other leading market indicators - Mr. Schmidt believes that there are many alternatives from which to choose in this market environment. On the top of his over-the-counter list are Dynascan, an electronics marketer; Bob Evans Farms, a sausage producer and restaurant operator, and CyCare Systems, a producer of medical computer systems. **********In addition, Mr. Schmidt is bullish on ''quality companies that have pulled back significantly in the last week.'' He said, ''They're not all that suddenly attractive, but they are more attractive than they were before.'' **********His selections from this group include such utilities as Allegheny Power, Bay State Gas and Utah Power and Light. Other possibilities for capital appreciation, Mr. Schmidt said, are retailers, such as Zayre and Wal-Mart, and railroads, such as Norfolk Southern and Burlington Northern."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/06/business/business-people-companies-built-up-by-buyout-partners.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1986-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 409, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Companies Built Up By Buyout Partners", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Companies Built Up By Buyout Partners", "body_text": " **********When Triangle Industries announced on Wednesday that it was calling in its $113.6 million of convertible debt, Nelson Peltz and Peter W.

Like millions of schoolchildren during World War II, they participated in the Government's savings stamp program. **********''We bought a 25-cent stamp from the teacher and stuck it in a little book,'' recalled Mr. Ross, now 55 and an area sales manager with the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Houston. ''After we filled the book up, we took it to the post office to get it redeemed.'' A book of $18.75 in stamps purchased a $25 Series E United States savings bond - known then as war savings bonds. **********Americans may not save much, compared to foreign citizens, but they have been buying savings bonds, the world's most widely held security, for half a century. ''Most of the money that goes into the bonds wouldn't have been saved otherwise,'' said James R. Wynn, director of sales for the Treasury Department's Savings Bond unit. **********''It's a good way to save,'' said Mrs. Ross, 51, whose family still buys the bonds. Among the attractions: Savings bonds are safe, easy to buy -through a bank or a payroll plan - and exempt from state and local taxes. They come in denominations as small as $25 and as large as $10,000. And they can survive their own destruction. ''We had a woman who cut up all her husband's bonds because she was mad at him,'' said a former Treasury employee in Wisconsin. In such cases, the Government sends replacements. **********Savings bonds have even become a hot investment. Recently, falling interest rates have lured so many investors to the bonds, which guaranteed a minimum yield of 7 1/2 percent if held five years, that sales have been running at more than $1 billion a month, the highest level since World War II. At September's end, the amount outstanding was a record $87 billion. Last week the Government decided it couldn't afford such a robust minimum and lowered the floor to 6 percent, still higher than rates offered by many money-market funds. **********It was the war that first pushed savings bonds into public consciousness, but the program was born in peacetime, a few years earlier. **********Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. had been impressed by the small-saver programs in Britain and France that offered Government securities tailored to the needs of ordinary citizens. He envisioned a similar program for Americans that would give people shaken by the Depression an incentive and means to begin saving again. **********Perhaps more important, he wanted to broaden the base of Government debt to include average citizens, a move that would lessen Government dependence on more expensive and less patriotic sources of funds in financial markets. **********His ideas still motivate the program. ''We want to finance the public debt in the most economical way,'' said Mr. Wynn of the Treasury. ''To teach thrift and create new savings has always been our secondary mission.'' With the ballooning deficit, inexpensive financing is more important than ever. ''For every billion dollars of bonds we sell, we save $26 million in debt costs,'' Mr. Wynn noted. **********The first savings bond, Series A, was issued on March 1, 1935. Unlike the liberty bonds of World War I, the ''baby bonds,'' as they came to be known, had a fixed rate. They were sold in post offices in denominations ranging from $25 to $1,000. That year, savings bond owners held close to 7 percent of the privately held portion of the national debt. The figure is about the same today, after reaching a high of 18 percent in 1944, a war year. **********The fledgling small-savers plan grew up suddenly in 1941, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked citizens to join him in ''one great partnership,'' to finance the war effort. **********''Attack, Attack, Attack - Buy War Bonds,'' screamed posters depicting grim-faced G.I.'s. Promotional messages filled the airwaves, magazines, newspapers and billboards. An army of nearly 6 million volunteers, including Hollywood stars, canvassed the country to drum up support for the bonds. Carole Lombard's fatal 1942 plane crash happened as she was returning home from a bond rally in Indianapolis, where she had helped to raise $2.5 million. All told, more than $54 billion in war savings bonds were sold from 1941 to 1945 as the strains of Irving Berlin's popular song, ''Any Bonds Today?'' floated across the land. **********After the war, especially in the late 1950's and the 60's, sales of savings bonds settled into a fairly steady pattern. About $4.5 billion worth of bonds were sold yearly. Rates hovered near the level of passbook savings accounts, around 4 percent, for much of the time. In 1963, to get businesses involved in the payroll savings plan, the U.S. Industrial Payroll Savings Committee was formed. Harold S. Geneen, the head of International Telephone and Telegraph, was its first chairman. By 1970, the savings stamp program was phased out for cost reasons, despite promotional help from such cultural icons as Lassie and the cast of ''Leave It to Beaver.'' **********Things began to look bleak for savings bonds in the late 1970's and early 80's, as interest rates soared over 20 percent. The bonds were paying less than half that rate. The problem was compounded by the fact that a change in savings bond rates had to be made by Congress. This sometimes took months. ''We couldn't react fast enough to the market,'' Mr. Wynn said. Sales of bonds plummeted, and redemptions rose. **********The program was revamped in 1982. The Treasury Department got the power to change the rate. The guaranteed minimum of 7 1/2 percent was established. And for the first time, the interest rate was tied to the market. The rate on the bonds is now equal to 85 percent of the average yield on five-year marketable Treasury securities, such as Treasury bonds and Treasury notes. **********That ''philosophical change'' in policy has helped assure the bonds' future, says Mr. Wynn. ''I can tell you that savings bonds will be competitive,'' he said. ''I couldn't say that in 1979.'' **********The program continues to depend heavily on volunteers. The National Savings Bond Volunteer Committee has 55 members in major cities and hundreds of volunteers in smaller places - everyone from local bankers and weekly newspaper editors to farmers. **********As the bonds have become more attractive, their promotional campaigns have changed. No longer is it necessary to sound the themes of public service and sacrifice. ''Now'' said Robert E. Mercer, chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber and of the National Volunteers, ''we have such a great product that we can talk about investment benefits instead of just waving the flag.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/24/world/30-years-later-an-ex-mountie-admits-a-betrayal.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1986-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 846, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "30 YEARS LATER, AN EX-MOUNTIE ADMITS A BETRAYAL", "print_headline": "30 YEARS LATER, AN EX-MOUNTIE ADMITS A BETRAYAL", "body_text": " **********Until the former Mountie appeared on a Canadian television show disguised in a wig and false mustache a few years ago, the Government didn't seem to be very interested that he had disclosed the identity of a Canadian double agent to the Soviet Union. **********Today, 30 years after he first passed secrets to two Soviet agents in Ottawa, the former corporal in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, James D. F. Morrison, surprised the Supreme Court of Ontario and pleaded guilty in one of Canada's most controversial spy cases. **********The prosecution in his trial charged that he betrayed the double agent, who was code-named Gideon, for 3,500 Canadian dollars - currently about $2,500. **********The K.G.B. double agent, who had infiltrated into Canada, supplied the mounted police with valuable information about Soviet espionage activities. After Mr. Morrison tipped off the Russians, the spy who had turned was recalled to the Soviet Union, and is believed to have been executed. **********An Argument on Rights **********Mr. Morrison, who is now 69 years old, once argued that the pressing of charges against him so many years later violated his rights under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Supreme Court of Ontario rejected this assertion in June 1984. **********Today, he cut short the complicated trial by pleading guilty to one count of unlawfully communicating secret information to two Soviet agents between April 1955 and January 1958 for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of Canada. **********In return, the prosecution dropped two related charges that restated his violations of Canada's Official Secrets Act. **********The former Mountie could be sentenced to life in prison. Justice Coulter Osborne of the province's Supreme Court, who is hearing the case, said today that he would pass sentence May 26. **********Oddly, Mr. Morrison, whom the Royal Canadian Mounted Police once code-named Long Knife to conceal his identity, had confessed his story to his superiors back in 1957. He was demoted and dismissed from the mounted police in 1958 after he also tried to pocket 1,400 Canadian dollars given him to spend on wiretaps. Charged in 1983 **********But Mr. Morrison was not formally charged with passing information to the Soviet Union until 1983, after he had appeared in disguise on ''Fifth Estate,'' a documentary television program, to talk about it. The mounted police moved to impound the program tape, three minutes of which were shown to the jury Wednesday. **********The betrayal was publicized earlier in a book, ''For Services Rendered,'' written by John Sawatsky, a Canadian journalist who investigated the case. **********The prosecution portrayed the former corporal as a free-spender who wanted the money to pay off heavy debts. He had worked for a plainclothes surveillance unit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that kept tabs on suspected spies and foreign agents. A new agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service took over the counterespionage role from the mounted police in July 1984. **********In 1953, a Soviet agent apparently named Brik, who had entered Canada to assume the identity of a Montreal photographer named David Soboloff, defected, bringing details about other Soviet spies and their operations. The real David Soboloff had gone back to the Soviet Union. **********The Canadians code-named the defector Gideon, passed on some of his information to allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and controlled information sought by the Russians about a jet fighter project called Avro Arrow. Valuable but Temperamental **********Terrance Guernsey, a retired Royal Canadian Mounted Police superintendent, told the court Wednesday that Gideon was the most valuable double agent recruited since World War II. But he was also temperamental, according to the report, and periodically refused to cooperate further with the mounted police, saying he wanted to live quietly in Canada. **********After Gideon's handlers placated him during a visit to Ottawa in 1955, Mr. Morrison, who normally performed routine surveillance duties, was ordered to drive the double agent to Montreal. **********According to the opening statement at the trial this week by Douglas J. A. Rutherford, an Assistant Deputy Attorney General of Canada's Justice Department, Mr. Morrison learned who Gideon really was and later approached the Russians to sell them the double agent's identity for 3,500 Canadian dollars. **********He was accused of passing information to the two Soviet agents, Nikolai Ostrovsky and Rem Krasilnikov, between April 1, 1955, and Jan. 31, 1958, to cover his debts. **********After the double agent was called home to the Soviet Union, Mr. Rutherford said, he was never heard from again. **********The Royal Canadian Mounted Police dismissed Mr. Morrison in 1958, but he was not immediately charged with violating the Official Secrets Act. He worked as a construction safety instructor in British Columbia before his arrest in 1983. **********Mr. Morrison, who looked impassive at his trial this week, protested in an interview several years ago that he did not sell out his country, but only one Russian ''down the drain.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/11/world/security-council-role-a-major-shift.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1986-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 983, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SECURITY COUNCIL ROLE: A MAJOR SHIFT", "print_headline": "SECURITY COUNCIL ROLE: A MAJOR SHIFT", "body_text": " **********Members of Congress, foreign policy experts and Administration officials say the involvement of the National Security Council staff in paramilitary operations represents a fundamental shift in its traditional role. **********The officials and experts said that for the first time, the President's closest foreign policy advisers were directly involving themselves in sensitive, potentially embarrassing operations such as the recently disclosed shipment of arms to Iran. **********They also point to the involvement of the National Security Council staff in assisting the Nicaraguan rebels after Congress cut off aid as evidence that this small, secretive group is taking on new, potentially troubling functions. **********''What they have done goes far beyond what anyone else has done with the N.S.C.,'' said David Aaron, the deputy national security adviser to President Carter. **********'A Little Oasis' **********''Using the N.S.C. in this kind of operational way is extremely dangerous,'' he said. ''The National Security Council is the one place in Government that is really is beyond the purview of the Congress. The national security adviser and his staff are not subject to Senate confirmation. This is a little oasis, and if the President abuses it, he'll lose it.'' **********Members of Congress began questioning the Reagan Administration's use of the National Security Council staff more than a year ago, when it was disclosed that one of its members was involved in advising the Nicaraguan rebels, or contras. At the time, Congress had cut off aid to the contras. **********The White House denied violating that ban, and the various Congressional inquiries into the issue never made much progress in specifying what connection the staff member, Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, had with the contras. **********That issue arose anew last month when a supply plane, part of a private network developed to deliver arms to the contras, was shot down over Nicaragua. North's Pervasive Role **********As more details emerged, it became clear that the supply operation included a number of expensive airplanes, well-paid crews, and many tons of arms. Several Administration officials acknowledged that this private network came together with the general knowledge and assistance of Colonel North. **********Among the evidence linking Colonel North to the contras were phone records that showed calls from safe houses in San Salvador used by the supply planes' crews to the office phone number of Colonel North at the White House. **********The White House vigorously disputes accusations that Colonel North's contacts with the contras violated the law. But no Administration official has been willing to discuss the content of these conversations, and it is generally agreed that Colonel North has maintained a relationship with the contras. **********Additionally, in the years before the Congressional cutoff, Colonel North played a significant role in planning such controversial operations as the C.I.A.-backed mining of Nicaraguan's harbors. **********Colonel North also has been linked to the negotiations with Iran. **********Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, noted that there are many precedents for a President relying on the National Security Council staff for sensitive diplomacy. **********The United States opening to China, for example, involved highly secret talks conducted by Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's national security adviser. The Carter White House was also involved in secret contacts with the Iranians in an effort to gain the release of American hostages seized at the United States Embassy in Teheran. **********The National Security Council has six members: President Reagan; Vice President Bush; Secretary of State George P. Shultz; Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger; the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe, and the Director of Central Intelligence, William J. Casey. **********These officials are in turn served by a staff of several dozen, directed by the national security adviser, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter. Iran 'Not a Rogue Operation' **********According to Administration officials, the decision to ship arms to Iran went forward despite the reservations of Mr. Shultz and Mr. Weinberger. Later, Mr. Shultz was said to have protested and succeeded in cutting off the operation temporarily earlier this year. **********Some time later, the shipments resumed. It could not be learned how much Mr. Shultz knew about the renewed flow of arms. **********Throughout the 18 months of dispute over the Iran operation, members of the National Security Council were continuing to make contacts with Iran and supervising secret arms shipments. Officials said the activities had been approved by the President. **********''This was not a rogue operation by Ollie North and Admiral Poindexter,'' one knowledgeable source said. ''It is inconceivable that something of such magnitude could have gone forward without knowledge of the Cabinet members who sit on the National Security Council.'' Management Deficiencies Seen **********The primary role of the National Security Council staff has traditionally been the coordination of the activities of the various parts of the foreign policy bureaucracy, ranging from the State Department to the policy advisers in the Pentagon. **********Critics of the current council have complained that it is weak in coordinating policy, and that interdepartmental disputes over such issues as arms control have raged for years without resolution. **********A Republican Congressional aide said the Iran case appeared to be an attempt by the council to bypass what is normally a slow-moving, overly deliberative process. Seeking decisive action, the council took over, cutting out most of the State Department, the C.I.A. and the Defense Department from knowledge of the operation. **********''If you think the President's authority gives you a mandate to take over a large operation, you get into difficulties because you don't have behind you the dampening effect of the bureaucracy,'' the aide said. ''The bureaucracy is ponderous, but it gives people a chance to assess risks, ponder the down side, and get balanced advice.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/23/business/company-news-owens-corning-board-rejects-bid-by-wickes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 446, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Owens-Corning Board Rejects Bid by Wickes", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Owens-Corning Board Rejects Bid by Wickes", "body_text": " **********The board of the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation rejected today a tender offer of $74 a share, or more than $2 billion, from the Wickes Companies. **********Owens-Corning called the offer ''inadequate, not fully reflecting the inherent values in the company and not in the best interests of the company and its stockholders.''

But now Alcoa and other aluminum companies are facing increasing pressure from imports and worldwide overcapacity. Aluminum prices and earnings have become more sensitive to cyclical swings in the economy. **********In addition, Alcoa is in the fourth week of a strike by 15,000 members of the United Steelworkers of America and the Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers International Union. C. Fred Fetterolf, Alcoa's president and chief operating officer, talks about his industry and his company. **********Q. Conditions in the aluminum industry seem to have followed the path of steel. Domestic demand was growing two or three times the G.N.P. rate in the late 1970's but now is lagging behind G.N.P. What is the outlook? **********A. I think the outlook for aluminum is probably more of the same. We do have new applications coming on, and we still have continued growth in the can market, which is our largest market by far. And while we don't have the growth rates of the 1970's in the United States, it's still relatively healthy. But there's no question that it has flattened out in the last three or four years. **********On an international basis, there are a lot of growth opportunities in aluminum. Of course, we really expect to participate in some of that growth. **********Q. If the unions' strike continues another month or more, what is the impact likely to be for your company and the industry? **********A. The impact on the industry is probably going to be positive. Prices will probably go up as some of our capacity goes down. At this stage of the game it's hard for us to call. We were prepared in terms of having inventory buildups of the products that are strategic to us, and we've got a supply that will last for some time. And we are running many of our plants - smelters particularly but fabricating facilities as well. **********We intend to hold onto our customers for strategic products as best we can. But it would be foolish to think that over a long period of time the strike wouldn't have a negative financial impact. **********Q. This year you announced a joint venture with Metal Box America to produce containers for the food industry. Do you see more joint ventures and more diversification? **********A. Sure. The Metal Box joint venture is our entry into plastic packaging. We hope to stay in the higher technology end of that arena. **********Everything we've done has been sort of aluminum-oriented. But we are in the marketplace, and we think we understand what packaging is all about. I would expect to see us continue to grow in packaging, either by joint venture or by ourselves. **********Q. The world is full of countries interested in making aluminum and selling it at prices that undercut the competition. So how will you or other domestic producers stay profitable? **********A. Again you have to separate the difference between fabricating and smelting. Much of what you are talking about is smelting. Fabricating is much higher in technology, much more regional. **********We have, with the advent of our curtailing 25 percent of smelting capacity in the United States, begun to fuel with self-generated, Alcoa-owned power facilities. And as long as you can be reasonably competitive on the power costs on a worldwide basis, it enables you to hang in there. **********There is no question that there's a depressive effect on the profitability of the metals business, and I'm really talking about the ingot business. **********There is less of an impact on the fabricating business. We have changed our focus to spend more on fabricating and less on other facilities. **********Q. How much more is Alcoa involved in fabricating now than it was, say, five years ago? **********A. Five years ago we were not a lot different in terms of actual fabricating pounds, but we are selling far fewer pounds of ingot than we were five years ago. I'd say that five years ago we were a big factor in the sale of ingot in the United States. Today that is not necessarily true, and that will be less true as we go to the future. We may either rely on ingot from overseas or buy it from someone. **********Although we shut down some 25 percent of our domestic capacity, that leaves us with a very large system in comparison with most other producers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/19/business/company-news-dome-seeks-delay.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dome Seeks Delay", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Dome Seeks Delay", "body_text": " **********Dome Petroleum Ltd. has asked its lenders to agree to delay payment of their debts, rather than force the company into liquidation, which it characterized as the other alternative.

Rockefeller, a young partner in a produce business in Cleveland, ventured into the oil business in 1863, the industry was in the midst of a disastrous glut, with wildly fluctuating prices and wholesale bankruptcies. Mr. Rockefeller saw opportunity in the chaos, and by 1882 he had established the Standard Oil Trust, the leviathan that eventually gave birth to the modern Exxon Corporation. **********The environment of collapsing oil prices is certainly more complicated now than it was in the industry's infancy. But when oil analysts look at Exxon's future, they invariably look backward as well as forward. What they see is an almost impregnable giant that has been able to take advantage of opportunities offered by bad markets as well as good ones. **********So while Exxon is facing many of the same short-term problems as the rest of the industry, analysts say that its enormous cash flow and light debt load could provide a historic opportunity for the world's largest oil company to become that much larger. **********No Major Purchase Likely **********Most analysts say it is unlikely that Exxon would go after another major oil company. Because of its size, few companies are under a greater glare of public scrutiny than Exxon, and an antitrust action would be almost inevitable. Equally important, corporate efficiency might suffer. Instead, the analysts say, Exxon would be more interested in buying distressed independents with valuable reserves or the oil properties spun off by vulnerable companies. **********''They have the financial strength to maintain the empire by buying producing properties that others have to sell,'' said R. Bryan Jacoboski, oil analyst at Paine Webber Inc. ''Rockefeller created the original trust by swallowing weaker companies. Exxon has the same opportunity now.'' **********He added, ''They've always waited for the opportunities that only a company with immense financial resources could take advantage of, and the opportunity of the 80's will be to buy reserves very inexpensively.'' **********Exxon has traditionally been reluctant to disclose much of its strategy, and company executives, including Clifton C. Garvin Jr., the chairman and chief executive officer, declined to be interviewed for this article. But industry analysts expect the company to continue to pare itself down over the short term while continuing to explore for oil and buy cheap reserves it will be able to develop when oil prices eventually rise. No Longer First in the World **********Mr. Jacoboski and other analysts do not minimize the short-term problems facing the company. It is a sign of the times that the General Motors Corporation recently edged out Exxon as the world leader in sales, reporting $96.37 billion in revenues for 1985, compared with Exxon's $93.21 billion. Exxon had captured the title from G.M. in 1974 when world oil prices were on the way up. **********If oil prices continue their tailspin, Exxon, which earned $4.87 billion, or $6.46 a share, last year, could face severely depressed earnings. Analysts say Exxon is also likely to reduce or eliminate the share repurchase program that has kept its stock near a record high during a dismal time for the industry. **********Paul Mlotok, who follows the international oil companies for Salomon Brothers, estimates Exxon's earnings for 1986 would be $7.10 if oil prices average $25 a barrel, $5.80 at $20 and $4.30 at $15. Some types of crude oil are now selling at $16 to $17 a barrel on the spot market. **********Mr. Mlotok said, however, that Exxon's sheer size and reach cushion it from all but the most catastrophic conditions in the industry. ''Exxon is one of the very few companies that could still earn more than its dividend at $15,'' he said. Exxon's Imperial Scope **********Almost everything about Exxon lends itself to hyperbole. The company has 150,000 employees in 80 countries. It has a share in some 29,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines, more than enough to straddle the globe. Exxon's fleet of ships, totaling some 16 million deadweight tons, is on a par with Britain's Royal Navy. Every day, about six million motorists stop at the 50,000 service stations that sell Exxon products. **********That imperial scope and Exxon's sense of the cyclical nature and tumultous history of the oil industry -Mr. Rockefeller's original rolltop desk is displayed in the executive dining room at Exxon's headquarters in New York - help define the company's cool, collaborative, rather impersonal management structure. **********By most accounts, Exxon's corporate culture depends more on collective decisions than individual brilliance. That can be a hindrance in times of great opportunity, but it also can help to provide stability in more difficult ones. **********''Exxon has been likened to an elephant crashing through the underbrush; it can be very hard to divert it,'' said William L. Randol, a former Exxon manager, who now follows the oil industry for the First Boston Corporation. ''This is an industry with a very long lead time, and Exxon is a very stable place that takes a very long view of its role.'' $2.1 Billion Judgment It is a mark of Exxon's strength that the company barely blinked last year when it was hit with a $2.1 billion judgment in an oil price case brought by the Government. In the case, Exxon was found to have overcharged customers by violating Energy Department regulations. The judgment became final last month when the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. A $545 million provision for the judgment helped keep 1985 earnings below those of 1984, but the company appears able to pay the judgment, the largest ever upheld on appeal, without a wrenching impact. **********Over the years, Exxon's size has allowed it to capitalize on opportunities that few other oil companies could afford. In 1948, for example, it bought a 30 percent interest in Aramco, the Arabian American Oil Company. **********But size has not always been viewed as an unquestioned benefit, and Exxon's success in recent years surprised some analysts. **********At the beginning of the 80's, Exxon was criticized for paying more than it should for some oil properties as well as for its inept entry into the office systems market and for a failure to replace reserves. In addition, its $2.1 billion purchase of the Reliance Electric Company in 1979 has not lived up to expectations, analysts say. Aggressive Cost Cutting **********Since then, the company has aggressively cut costs - it has reduced its work force by 17 percent since 1981 and cut refinery capacity by 23 percent - while stepping up exploration and acquisition activity. Worldwide capital and exploration expenditures totaled $10.7 billion last year, up 11 percent from 1984. **********What now distinguishes Exxon from most of its peers is its lean balance sheet. Along with Royal Dutch/ Shell, Exxon is one of the two major oil companies with the lowest proportion of debt. The current debt-to-equity ratio is about 19 percent, less than half that of many others in the industry. **********The company's strong cash flow of about $10 billion a year has helped fund a share repurchase program that has seen Exxon buy back 14 percent of its stock since 1982. The program, under which Exxon spent some $2.7 billion last year, had the effect of keeping the stock price near its record high of $56.125 for most of last year while paying a hefty dividend of $3.60 a share. The stock, which had slipped to the low $20's before the repurchase program, has dropped back somewhat during the recent oil price collapse. It closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $50.125, up 12.5 cents. **********One reason for the light debt load has been Exxon's reluctance to join the industry's merger wars. Analysts say the reluctance stems from a number of factors. In any event, in light of the collapse in oil prices, that decision now looks like a wise one. Slow to Move **********On the other hand, the company is sometimes criticized for being too slow to take advantage of the full range of financial options that have developed as oil turned into a volatile commodity in recent years. **********''In periods of great oil price uncertainty and volatility, one should make use of every possible financial mechanism, including hedging of futures markets,'' said one analyst. ''Exxon has not participated, or they've been a minor participant.'' **********A number of critics, noting that the stocks of all the large oil companies sell at big discounts from the value of their assets, say Exxon is still too big and bulky for the good of its shareholders and would benefit from spinning off producing properties or breaking itself up into as many as 10 or 20 companies. **********''I give them credit for their share repurchase program, but they're still a big lumbering giant with a huge cash flow and limited investment opportunities,'' said T. Boone Pickens, chairman of the Mesa Petroleum Company. **********Others in the industry disagree. ''The big companies like Exxon are the only ones who can do the kind of frontier exploration that is needed,'' said George Mitchell, chairman of the Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation in Houston. **********For Exxon, the first casualty of the current environment could be the stock repurchase plan. Analysts say falling oil prices and the $2.1 billion court judgment will make it impossible later this year for the company to buy back shares at the current level of one million shares a week without borrowing money. **********Exxon is expected to take advantage of the depressed oil market, however, by increasing its acquisition activity. In the last two years, it has been a quiet but aggressive buyer of oil properties along with other financially strong companies, particularly Amoco and Shell. **********Exxon spent about $600 million on oil properties in 1984. It has not disclosed the total amount of its purchases for 1985, but they included buying a 49 percent stake in the Hunt Oil Company's interests in Yemen. So far this year, Exxon has paid about $90 million for Australian properties owned by Occidental Petroleum."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/29/world/seoul-debate-leading-roll-of-the-army.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1986-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 933, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEOUL DEBATE: LEADING ROLL OF THE ARMY", "print_headline": "SEOUL DEBATE: LEADING ROLL OF THE ARMY", "body_text": " **********A rumor swept this city not long ago, a rumor that revealed just how much the military is on people's minds. During a raucous dinner at an exclusive restaurant, the story went, high-ranking generals had beaten up the floor leaders of both the ruling and the opposition parties. **********For weeks the ''dinner party incident'' was the talk of Seoul, no matter how many times people involved tried to explain that at worst, a few drunken people had taken a few drunken swings at each other. But the story raised hackles because it seemed to illustrate a fact of life that grates on many Koreans - the power of the military. **********Detractors call the military the most important and most impregnable barrier to democracy in South Korea. Supporters laud it as the most patriotic, most capable, least corruptible source of leadership in times of crisis. However it is viewed, the presence of the military remains the dominant fact, and the central question, in Korean politics today. **********In the last 25 years, through two military coups, South Korea has been ruled nearly continuously by military or ex-military men. Former military officers hold important posts in the executive and legislative branches of the Government, in the diplomatic corps and in the business world. The current Government was formed as a result of a military coup and is headed by a former general, Chun Doo Hwan. Defining Political Boundaries **********''We have a unique situation, '' said Hyun Hong Choo, a prominent member of the ruling Democratic Justice Party. ''Here is a group of people, well organized, well disciplined - just by sitting there they are a political force.'' **********In many ways, this presence defines political boundaries. As lawmakers spend this month publicly debating the shape of a new constitution, the underlying question is what kind of government and what potential leaders of that government would be acceptable to the military, in and out of uniform. **********The extent of the military's influence in Korea is hard to define precisely. But diplomats, politicians from both parties and military-watchers here say the military does not intervene in day-to-day political decisions. **********''This is not a typical junta government,'' said one longtime observer of the military. ''A division is made between those who keep uniforms on and those who take uniforms off.'' **********The real power, these observers say, lies with President Chun and his close aides, all former military men who share the military's concern for social stability above all. **********But officers who still hold their commissions also command influence, through their ties to two key intelligence-gathering bodies - the Defense Security Command, which monitors the military, and the Agency for National Security Planning, the former Korean Central Intelligence Agency. The Proper Political Role **********For some South Koreans, the continuing power of the military means that the nation cannot become a full-fledged democracy. ''Unfortunately, we seem to be faced with two choices - a government ruled by military men, which we have now, or a fairly weak government that cannot do much harm to the military,'' a political scientist said. **********But others see a legitimate political role for the military. ''I think in a sense it is inevitable to have a military with some political influence because of our special defense situation and the role that the military has played in the past,'' Mr. Hyun said. ''Because of their contribution to national security, they have a role that can be justified, and we should recognize that political reality.'' **********Indeed, for many years the military was one of the few South Korean institutions to espouse a different ethic of leadership - officers selected and promoted on a merit basis, rather than the more traditional Korean ties of kinship or social status. **********Cadets at the Korean Military Academy are well grounded in economics and management theory, and Korea's rapid economic growth took place under military rule. At least during the early years after the Korean War, political scientists here said, the military filled a leadership vacuum. Past Military Infighting **********It is also during the four-year course at the military academy that friendships and enmities develop that can exert great influence in South Korean politics. It was members of the eighth class - angered by the corruption of both the civilian Government and their own military superiors - who staged the 1961 military coup and ran the Government thereafter. **********After President Park Chung Hee was assassinated in 1979 by a member of the K.C.I.A., members of the 11th class, led by Chun Doo Hwan, then a lieutenant general, overthrew the Government. Members of the 11th class considered themselves blocked from advancing by the eighth class. **********Most here predict that the military is likely to play a low-key role for the time being, but would be most inclined to step in if its leaders believe their influence is threatened by a strong civilian leader or if they believe that radical elements in the society are out of control, inviting moves from North Korea. **********Few assert that the military will soon disengage from politics. Mr. Hyun said that he thought a gradual shift to military neutrality might come after several peaceful transfers of power occur without any shake-ups in the military hierarchy or prolonged social unrest. **********''I don't think the Korean military has reached a point where they believe that further military intervention will fail,'' said Lee Chul, an opposition lawmaker.

After the arrest, the Malaysian Foreign Minister, Daim Zainuddin, flew here from Kuala Lumpur to consult with the Singapore Government and Mr. Tan, who was released Thursday on $9.3 million (United States) bail. **********Two months ago, Mr. Tan, a majority shareholder in Pan-Electric, was elected president of the Malaysian Chinese Association, the most influential Chinese party in Malaysia and a member of the National Front coalition now in power under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. It was Pan-Electric's failure to meet its $187 million in debts that led in December to the unprecedented closing for three days of the Singapore and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges. **********Seeking Company's Rescue **********Mr. Tan, who is associated with at least a dozen other often-interlocking companies registered in Kuala Lumpur or Singapore or both, had been in discussions with Pan-Electric's receivers, the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, about a plan to bail out the Singapore-based property and marine salvage company. **********He was picked up for questioning here Tuesday by the Finance Ministry's Commercial Affairs Investigation Department. Late that night, he was unexpectedly taken into custody, and on Thursday afternoon a magistrate's court heard the formal charges and set the record bail. **********In pressing charges against Mr. Tan, despite the effect this is likely to have on the already unstable political and economic situation in Malaysia, Singapore seemed to be serving notice that it intends to maintain its reputation for acting swiftly against illegal practices in business, no matter how important the political connections involved. **********The Singapore authorities say they are anxious to prevent further erosion of confidence in this small nation's economy, which relies heavily on foreign investment. Singapore has had its worst year in two decades of independence, with negative growth possible for 1985.

On Wednesday, the Cabinet decided to make public in March a recent report on a billion-dollar scandal involving unsecured loans made to Hong Kong property speculators by the state-owned Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Company. There had been pressures in the Malaysia Government to keep the report secret. **********And on Wednesday night, Prime Minister Mahathir himself denied on national television that he was corrupt, saying rumors to that effect were politically motivated. Under the Malaysian constitution, his government must face a national election in the next year. **********The Singapore stock market reacted on Wednesday to the detention of Mr. Tan by dropping to its lowest point in three years. Stock markets in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong were also affected. **********Financial experts and diplomats here say that the arrest of Mr. Tan means it may now be impossible to prevent the complete collapse of Pan-Electric, and the Singapore Government has made no move to rescue the company. Mr. Tan had been depicted as the last hope of saving the company. Price Waterhouse had been pressing him to deliver rescue funds he had pledged in December. **********According to The Straits Times of Singapore, Mr. Tan was apparently involved in selling more than $65 million worth of ''forward contracts'' in shares to Pan-Electric.

Ramos, and one of the young colonels who have come to be known as heroes of the revolution. **********''We are showing the history of the Philippines,'' she said. **********Across the narrow street from her, Rose Villamater stood behind the counter of the Villamater bakery handing out free packets of cookies known as apas and broas. **********A stuffed figure on her roof showed a baker hard at work by his oven, as if oblivious to the history depicted on Mrs. Galio's roof across the way. **********''Are you K.B.L.?

The character was a rightist bigot full of rancor whom he lampooned with savage effect - in so doing lampooning as well a certain prototype of the ordinary Frenchman from the provinces largely untouched by the values of the Enlightenment. **********Women Weep on the Street **********When he died of what his manager called intestinal cancer - after trying to keep his illness a secret for several months - the event took on the proportions of a national tragedy, showing that Mr. Le Luron had touched some very deep sentiment in the collective French soul. **********Women wept on the street. Virtually every major political figure in this country, including those he mercilessly mimicked in his nightclub sketches, issued testimonials on his behalf. At least two, including former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, credited him with mirroring their vocal faults so perfectly that they strove to correct them. **********''The great media tears, the chorus of cathode ray tube testimonials add nothing to his talent, which remains living,'' the commentator for Le Monde said Friday, making her sarcastic suggestion that Mr. Le Luron be buried in the Pantheon, beside French heroes such as Victor Hugo and Emile Zola. Not in Pantheon, but in Church **********Mr. Le Luron will be buried Tuesday in Brittany, not in the Pantheon. But on Saturday thousands of people waited for hours to pass by his closed coffin, which was placed on a catafalque inside the great Madeleine church in Paris. That is in itself the kind of honor that would not normally go to a nightclub comedian, even one with such unmistakable talent. **********And so, after Mr. Le Luron's death, some thoughtful people in French society were asking what the trauma occasioned by his death suggests about the preoccupations of the French these days. Why was Thierry Le Luron so popular? **********The answer seems to lie in two elements surrounding both his life and his death, one of them circumstantial and the other linked to longstanding French obsessions. **********The circumstantial factor was that Mr. Le Luron's final days became the stuff of a medical drama, which had been amply served up in serial fashion in the last several months by the glossy picture magazines here. Rumors of His Illness **********The first sign of his sickness came almost a year ago when he canceled a scheduled performance, giving rise to rumors that he had cancer or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. **********Mr. Le Luron angrily denied in interviews in the glossy magazines that he had either disease, asserting at one time that he was not the ''French Rock Hudson,'' referring to the American actor who died of AIDS last year. ''My sickness is these rumors,'' he said in one interview. **********Officially, it was said Thursday that Mr. Le Luron died of intestinal cancer, and there is no proof whatsoever that the truth is otherwise. But it is clear as well that during his struggle, the possibility that he was suffering from AIDS gave rise to a widespread morbid curiosity. **********Now there are sly suggestions -again without proof - that Mr. Le Luron's death has become the object of a medical cover-up. Le Monde, in its report Friday, for example, spoke of the ''exemplary, solitary combat that he waged against the very name of his disease.'' Another Comedian Who Died **********There was more to the national attention given to Mr. Le Luron. It happens that his death came just five months after a motorcycle accident killed his only real competitor for the position of France's most beloved comedian, a Rabelaisian and often intentionally vulgar 41-year-old actor named simply Coluche. **********Whereas Mr. Le Luron was slight, boyish and elegant, Coluche was a sledgehammer comedian, a jowly, heavyset man who dressed himself up as Tarzan or as a vulgarly bejeweled society madame. His political sympathies lay on the left. **********Mr. Le Luron was known as a rightist, even though his most celebrated act, besides the proto-fascist Monsieur Glandu, was to caricature with uncanny exactitude virtually all the major members of the French political class, making presidents, prime ministers and the heads of political parties look selfish and venal, petty and ridiculous. Humor and Guillotines **********What linked the two men was their comic irreverence and the unsparing nature of their satire. They both used humor to deal with power the way revolutionaries once used the guillotine, and this in itself was revolutionary in its way. Until Coluche and Thierry Le Luron came along, political figures, even when they were hated, had been treated with a quasi-religious respectfulness in France. **********That alone guaranteed both of them a certain notoriety. After Mr. Le Luron's death, French political figures issued glowing statements of praise and affection for the man who had achieved such success ridiculing them. **********Clearly, it had become something of a badge of honor to have been one of Mr. Le Luron's targets. Serge July, the editor of the newspaper Liberation, said Mr. Le Luron picked out from among ambitious men and women those who would ''become the noted personalities of the tragicomedy of power.'' **********''The two of them,'' Mr. July said, referring to Mr. Le Luron and Coluche, ''taught the French of the 1980's that they could laugh at anything, without exception.'' **********Then, within five months, both of them died, and it was clear that France felt bereft of its incitements to laughter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/business/big-paine-webber-gain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 52, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Paine Webber Gain", "print_headline": "Big Paine Webber Gain", "body_text": " **********Earnings of the Paine Webber Group Inc. more than doubled in its first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31 to $14.2 million, or 70 cents a share, from $6 million, or 36 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

If the tax bill is enacted, as seems likely, accelerated depreciation would be replaced by the more conservative straight-line method. The 19-year depreciation period would lengthen to 27 1/2 years for residential real estate and 31 1/2 years for commercial buildings, reducing investors' annual deductions. **********Furthermore, rental activities would be classified as ''passive '' investments, and passive losses would generally be deductible only against passive income from similar investments, not earned income, interest or dividends. In any event, those deductions would be less valuable with lower tax rates. If the tax break for long-term capital gains is eliminated, many investors who now pay no more than 20 percent on real estate gains would face a tax increase on those profits. **********These tax disincentives are painfully clear to real estate professionals. ''The construction of income-producing real estate will be reduced, compared to what it would have been under current law,'' said Mitchell Hochberg, senior vice president of VMS Realty Partners, a Chicago-based investment firm. **********But some contrarians - seeing the glass as half full rather than half empty - view this as a buying opportunity for income-producing real estate. Their reasoning: A slowdown in new construction would enable owners of existing buildings to rent their excess space. Once that space is absorbed, landlords would be able to increase rents. Higher rents would mean higher returns and, ultimately, higher prices. ''While the immediate impact of tax reform on the value of equity in commercial real estate is clearly negative, the long-term effect on property values could be extremely positive,'' concluded a recent report from Salomon Brothers. **********In Mr. Hochberg's view, most investors should concentrate on real estate that is generating immediate cash distributions. That is, there should be enough rental revenue to cover all expenses and leave an excess to pay out to investors. **********There are two ways to invest in this kind of property. You can buy a building directly, on your own or with a small group of associates. The new tax plan appears to encourage this type of investment: Landlords who actively manage their buildings would be permitted to use up to $25,000 in losses to offset other income. This provision holds as long as the owner's adjusted gross income is less than $100,000; above this level, the $25,000 allowance diminishes and disappears altogether at an adjusted gross income of $150,000. **********However, direct ownership is not for everyone. ''Owning and managing real estate is more complex than most people realize,'' said Jonnie Mann, an analyst with the Mutual Service Corporation, a Detroit-based securities firm. ''Under the new tax law, there will be less forgiveness for every management mistake, because Government's tax subsidies will be reduced,'' she added. **********The alternative is to invest indirectly through a limited partnership or a real estate investment trust. For as little as $1,000, an investor generally gets property diversification as well as professional management. However, the costs are high: from 10 percent to 20 percent of the initial outlay is likely to wind up in the sponsor's pocket. **********Most sponsors say they are able to buy properties today with capitalization ratios of about 9 - that is, the ratio of a property's cash flow to its purchase price, assuming no debt. So if a partnership buys a property for $1 million, free of any mortgages, that property should return about $90,000, or 9 percent, in cash after its first full year of operation. **********Upfront fees, however, would reduce the return to investors. Sponsors might raise a total of $1.2 million, with $1 million going to purchase the building and the other $200,000 (16.6 percent) earmarked for themselves. A $90,000 cash yield on a $1.2 million investment is a 7.5 percent yield to investors. Generally, this type of unleveraged partnership offers initial returns of 6 percent to 8 percent. **********Leveraged partnerships, by contrast, usually have lower initial cash returns, because mortgage interest must be paid. In either case, real estate tax benefits that still are available - mainly depreciation - will offset most or all of the income, reducing the tax owed on the cash received. Thus, investors can expect a return comparable to what they might get with a municipal bond. **********However, there is opportunity for growth. After a few years, rents might increase so there is $100,000 to distribute to investors. On a $1.2 million cash outlay, that is an 8.3 percent return. Over a 10-year holding period, rents could go even higher. **********Keith D. Allaire, a vice president of Robert A. Stanger & Company, a real estate research and consulting firm, said his firm's studies show the new law would hit some investments harder than others. ''Leveraged partnerships would be hurt by the new tax plan because they provide more tax deductions and more long-term capital gains,'' he said. ''Mortgage loan partnerships and all-cash property ownership partnerships would do slightly better'' than under current law, because of the lower tax rate on the income they generate. **********But in the long term, leveraged real estate still looks most attractive, Mr. Allaire said - if you believe that rents will rise. If rents go up about 3 percent a year, a moderately leveraged real estate investment - one that is one-half to two-thirds financed by a mortgage - can be expected to generate a compound return equivalent to about 8 percent a year after tax, under the current tax proposals, assuming a 10-year holding period. That is similar to what all-cash ownership partnerships will yield. But if a shortage forces rents up 6 percent or 9 percent a year, after-tax compound yields would rise to 14 percent or 19 percent, respectively, according to Stanger. NOT all partnerships will produce such yields, even if rents increase dramatically. ''The most important thing an investor can do,'' said Ms. Mann, ''is to invest with a sponsor with a record for success.'' Check sponsors' track records in the prospectus. Ideally, they will have had broad experience in finance and construction - and have sufficient financial muscle, in holdings of cash and liquid securities, to ride out problems. Before investing, get an independent evaluation from a lawyer or accountant who does not stand to profit if you buy into the deal. **********If tax benefits shrivel under a new law, will the result be a depressed market with few buyers? Mr. Hochberg thinks not: ''Many countries around the world have almost no tax benefits for real estate,'' he said. ''Yet properties sell for 20 times income there, compared with 10 or 11 times income in the United States. Real estate is a scarce commodity that has inherent value.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/04/business/credit-markets-long-term-bond-prices-rise.html": {"writer_name": "H.

As a result, its yield ended at 7.32 percent after being as low as 7.30 percent. **********Still, the price of the long bond was up a further 10/32 on the day. In the last two sessions, the long bond's price has risen $12.50 for each $1,000 of face value. **********But the late profit taking caused prices of intermediate maturities to finish unchanged to modestly higher on the day. The 6 1/2 percent notes of 1988, for example, were unchanged at 100.6, to yield 6.15 percent; the 6 5/8 percent issue of 1992 gained 5/32, at 100.6, and now yield 6.58 percent, and the 7 1/4 percent issue of 1996 rose 3/32, to 101.12, and yield 7.05 percent. **********Discount rates on Treasury bills again were essentially unchanged, but the 90-day issue ended two basis points higher, at 5.42 percent. **********Meanwhile, the closely watched Federal funds rate, the basic lending rate, softened yesterday after the Federal Reserve again directly added temporary reserves to the banking system through systemwide overnight repurchase agreements. **********More significant, according to dealers, was the ''pass'' made by the central bank in the afternoon, when it added permanent reserves through the outright purchase of all maturities of Treasury bills from banks and other financial institutions. **********Because the Federal funds rate is considered the rock-bottom cost of credit, any action by the central bank to move it either way has a direct influence on most, if not all, interest rates. For example, dealers said that the Fed's temporary and permanent injections of liquidity into the banking system probably prevented the funds rate from soaring. **********As it was, the funds rate traded no higher than 7 percent and closed at about where it opened, 6 5/8 percent. This was significant because Wednesday is the end of the bank statement week, when banks often pay exorbitant rates to borrow overnight cash in order to meet reserve requirements. **********''Despite the late profit taking, the credit market is in good form and prices should move even higher,'' said Philip Braverman, chief economist at the government securities division of the Irving Trust Company. ''The funds rate eased, along with oil prices; sales of new single-family homes not only plunged in October, but so did their average price.'' **********The drop in new-home sales is bullish for the bond market because it indicates a weakening of the economy, which in turn means a lessened demand for credit and thus less upward pressure on interest rates and inflation, the bane of bondholders. **********''It also means that if the economy remains sluggish, which we think it will for the foreseeable future, then the Fed may well set off another wave of interest rate reductions by cutting its discount rate,'' Mr. Braverman said. **********Michael P. Fedofsky, Treasury securities trader at Prudential-Bache Securities, said that while large financial institutions were the major buyers of long-term issues, ''more and more smaller investors are now buying shorter maturities, such as the two-year T-notes.'' He added, ''In fact, more and more of our retail customers tell us they are switching out of the stock market and into Treasury issues.'' **********One of the day's major negative factors consisted of reports from the Japanese press that insurance companies planned to reduce their holdings of United States Treasury securities by the amount of the appreciation in the value of the yen against the dollar. **********While the reports were vague and often contradictory, some dealers said it might have prompted some of the late selling in both the bond futures and cash markets. In Chicago, the spot December bond futures closed up 9/32, at 101 3/32, after the price had been as high at 101 20/32. **********But Mr. Braverman and several other money market analysts noted that the yen was no longer appreciating because the dollar's decline appeared to have been arrested. **********''If the report had come from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, it would be a serious development,'' Mr. Braverman said.

In both instances, the diplomats were driving automobiles bearing special license plates indicating their nationality. **********By passing into West Berlin, the Syrians were in violation of a banning order announced by the three Western allies last month after a West Berlin court implicated the Syrian mission in East Berlin in a bombing at an Arab club in West Berlin on March 29. **********The three allies - the United States, Britain and France - banned 34 Syrians linked to the embassy and announced the measure in the name of the four-power Kommandatura, which until it was abandoned by the Soviet Union in 1948 nominally governed a unified Berlin. A Commercial Attachee **********The first Syrian to defy the ban was Tewfik Sermayati, who identified himself as a commercial attache at the Syrian mission and said he was going to pick up some people at Tegel Airport in West Berlin. ''They are presumably still waiting for him,'' an American diplomat familiar with the case said. **********Apprehended by the German police, Mr. Sermayati had to leave his car parked not far from Checkpoint Charlie - one of the main crossing points through the Berlin wall - and was taken to a nearby police station. There he had a mug shot taken and was forced to give samples of his fingerprints; the documents he brought with him were photographed. **********Finally, after two and a half hours, Mr. Sermayti signed a document acknowledging that he was being expelled from ''greater Berlin'' as ''an unwanted person'' - language that was first adopted by the victors in World War II to prevent troublemakers from entering the devastated former capital of the German Reich. **********With his car still parked at the site of his arrest, Mr. Sermayati was driven in a police van to the westernmost part of West Berlin and at Heerstrasse escorted to a crossing point that leads into East German territory - but not into East Berlin. By taking him to the Heerstrasse crossing, the allies made the point he was being expelled from Berlin, which they consider as theoretically still under four-power control. A Two-Hour Bus Ride **********''He was somewhat confused when, in the gathering gloom at 5:30 in the afternoon, he was let out of a windowless Black Maria and, blinking in the lights, asked, 'Where am I?' '' said one official involved in the expulsion. ''He wasn't feeling terribly wanted as he walked into the darkness of Heerstrasse.'' **********From this point, it is about a two-hour bus ride around the wall that girdles West Berlin, through the industrial outskirts of East Berlin and into the heart of the Communist capital, where the Syrian mission is situated. The Arab diplomat was told he would have to make his own arrangements to retrieve his car. **********The Syrian who attempted to enter West Berlin yesterday gave his name as Fouad Zaaboub, saying he was a member of the embassy's administrative section, according to informed sources. He said he was on ''routine business'' visiting a travel agency he said he owned in West Berlin. **********Mr. Zaaboub was given the same treatment as his colleague, but, as he was being driven to Heerstrasse, protested vainly he had left the keys to his East Berlin apartment in his car. When he gave the address of the apartment, he was told he would have to abandon it, since it, too, was in ''greater Berlin.'' A Noticeable Change **********Under the Kommandatura's banning order, the Soviet Union - at least under the allies' interpretation of Berlin precedent - is obliged to eject the ''unwanted'' Syrians from the eastern sector of the city. This has not happened, but Western diplomats say they are gratified there has been a noticeable thinning-out of the Libyan People's Bureau on the Communist side of the city. **********The East German police, according to Western diplomats, also appear to have stepped up the surveillance of a number of Arab missions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/16/world/panamanian-is-killed-in-labor-law-protest.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PANAMANIAN IS KILLED IN LABOR LAW PROTEST", "print_headline": "PANAMANIAN IS KILLED IN LABOR LAW PROTEST", "body_text": " **********Soldiers armed with M-16 rifles reinforced scores of riot policemen outside the National Assembly today after at least one person was killed and an undetermined number of people were hurt in anti-Government protests. **********The disturbances began near the assembly late Friday night and continued until dawn as Panama entered the sixth day of a nationwide strike called to protest proposed changes in labor laws. **********The labor moves were proposed by President Eric Arturo Delvalle last week as part of an economic austerity package that would help the country qualify for new credits and debt financing from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. **********The opposition newspaper La Prensa reported that a 22-year-old demonstrator was shot at point-blank range by a policeman. **********A spokesman for the National Defense Forces, Panama's combined police and military force, said policemen fired only tear gas and birdshot to quell the riot along a 10-block stretch of a major downtown avenue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/16/business/advertising-almay-is-dropped.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Almay Is Dropped", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Almay Is Dropped", "body_text": " **********Saatchi & Saatchi Compton has resigned its $5 million Almay Cosmetics and Toiletries account, which it acquired a year and a half ago, to leave itself ''open to accept a major cosmetics and toiletries assignment,'' according to Edward L.

Mr. Gandhi said recently that Tamil and Sri Lanka Government negotiators should now deal with each other directly. But since then, officials in New Delhi have said they might try to start talks again in April. **********Complicating Sri Lanka's problems has been an economic decline in the last several months, according to Finance Minister Ronnie De Mel. **********In an interview, Mr. De Mel said Sri Lanka had been badly hurt by the recent collapse of prices for tea and coconuts and a sharp rise in military spending in January that could force a cutback in spending for economic development. He said that tourism fell by 30 percent in 1984 and another 10 percent last year, and that foreign investment was drying up because of the failure of the negotiations this year. **********Despite the war, Sri Lanka's economy managed to grow 5 percent in the last two years, but he said he doubted that this rate could be maintained. **********The guerrillas seek an independent state for Tamils in the northern and eastern part of Sri Lanka, an island nation off southern India dominated by the Sinhalese, the majority ethnic group. The negotiations have been aimed at a possible formula granting political autonomy to Tamil-dominated areas. **********The main battles in recent weeks have occurred in the east, particularly around the Tamil areas at the ports of Trincomalee and Batticaloa. Because of the deteriorating situation, the United States has removed Peace Corps volunteers from these areas. **********In the northern Jaffna Peninsula, the Tamil insurgents exercise virtual sovereignty, with the authority of Government forces extending no farther than the perimeter of their armed camps. In other parts of the north, Government troops are able to make sweeps but unable to retain complete control, according to officials, diplomats and witnesses. **********In one key respect, Sri Lanka officials and diplomats say, the Government has managed to improve its military position. Air strikes from newly acquired helicopters and airplanes are widely believed to have given the Government a new advantage, particularly in the east. **********''The Tamils are not as effective as they used to be,'' said a knowledgeable diplomat with ties to the Tamils. ''By use of force, the army is changing the population of the Eastern Province. They are driving thousands of Tamils out of the area.'' **********But the air strikes were suspended recently after it was reported that innocent civilians were being killed. The reports led to angry protests in India, where the Indian Foreign Minister charged that Sri Lanka's policy included ''elements of genocide.'' **********The charge was rejected by Government leaders, who countered by again accusing New Delhi of permitting weapons to be shipped to the rebels from bases in southern India. They said 14 boats carrying arms were spotted in February alone. **********Lalith Athulathmudali, Sri Lanka's National Security Minister, said in an interview here that civilians had indeed died in Government air attacks, but he asserted that the guerrillas had killed many more civilians than the Government. Military Balance Could Shift **********''It can happen when you use air power,'' Mr. Athulathmudali said of the civilian casualties. ''That is one of the reasons we have ordered a suspension of the strikes. If you want to say that innocent people are arrested, that is also true. But the people who are not identified as terrorists are released.'' **********Military analysts say the Government's current advantage could end quickly if the Tamil guerrillas acquire the means to shoot down the helicopters. Diplomats say it is only a matter of time before the militants get shoulder-launched heat-seeking missiles. **********The guerrilla groups espouse a Marxist-Leninist line and proclaim friendship with groups such as the Palestine Liberation Organization. Sri Lanka officials charge that the rebels get weapons with the help of Libya and various international terrorist groups. **********Army forces have spent much of the last year trying to instill discipline to avoid rampages by soldiers and the killing of civilians. Reports about the success of these efforts are mixed. **********The Tamil movement for greater political rights grew in the 1970's, but not until the last few years did it become a full-scale insurgency. Experts on all sides agree that the guerrillas were able to become strong by using southern India as a sanctuary and arms supply base. **********A year ago Tamil military pressure reached a peak. The small, largely ceremonial Sri Lanka Army was overwhelmed, Government officials now acknowledge. Insurgents were finding it relatively easy to rob banks, raid police stations and blow up military convoys and warehouses. **********But in the last year the Government has greatly increased the size of the army and enhanced its equipment. American-made helicopters have been purchased from companies in Singapore and converted into gunships. Fixed-wing aircraft have been bought from Italy and also armed. **********Diplomats say Sri Lanka has also bought aircraft, armed vehicles and navy patrol boats from Britain, South Africa and Israel.

He said he favored White House efforts to negotiate a new treaty with the Soviet Union that actually reduces the level of nuclear weapons. The 1979 pact, which was never ratified, allows measured growth in various categories of arms. **********But the primary reaction on Capitol Hill came from critics of the Administration, who argued that the 1979 treaty put greater restraints on Moscow than it did on Washington. **********Representative Dante B. Fascell, the Florida Democrat who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee, said that to abandon the treaty ''would heat up the arms race and give unprecedented opportunities to the Soviets to substantially increase their nuclear threat against the United States.'' **********Mr. Dicks's bill states that ''no funds may be obligated or expended'' for the deployment or maintenance of weapons that exceed the limits in the treaty. The President could seek a waiver of the limits if he felt it was warranted by national security, but both houses of Congress would have to agree. **********Senator Byrd endorsed this concept in his floor speech and said that ''weapons deployment schedules should be funded by the Congress in such a way to keep the window of opportunity open'' for the continued enforcement of the treaty, at least for the rest of this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/11/business/key-rates-185986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/14/business/business-people-hammermill-president-adjusting-to-takeover.html": {"writer_name": "John Crudele", "pub_date": "1986-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 452, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hammermill President Adjusting to Takeover", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Hammermill President Adjusting to Takeover", "body_text": " **********W.

And doing well. **********It is Mr. Martin's theory that some disgruntled big-city creatives saw this work and opted to leave the big towns that didn't seem to appreciate them. Once in their new locations they attracted the new breed of advertisers, the kind who would trade the Broadway shows and nightclubs for the chance to get good advertising. **********''I've added 65 new people since 1965 without using a headhunter,'' said Mr. Martin, whose clients, responsible for more than $52 million in billings last year, are largely (80 percent) based outside of Virginia. About half of them are national accounts, with headquarters as far away as Chicago, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Palm Beach. **********''In any sales dynamic, awareness is what you have to have, positive awareness,'' he said, in explaining his success in attracting the big-city people. **********Although the 55-year-old Mr. Martin went to college in Virginia - at Hampden-Sydney College - he was born in Tucson, Ariz., when his dad, the late H. Phillips Martin, was punching cattle. But while the father's early cowboy career was not emulated by the son, his later endeavors as advertising and public relations director of Agway and as director of information for the Southern States Cooperative seemed to have had an effect. For, after graduating from college in 1952, David Martin joined a small Maryland newspaper and got to be its ad director before going to the VanSant Dugdale agency in Baltimore, which in time led to Cargill, Wilson & Acree in Richmond. **********Then, with a fellow worker, George R. Woltz, he founded Martin & Woltz, with a first assignment from the A.H. Robins Company. Both the partner and that client have left. But what do you expect? If you wanted permanence you'd go into the granite memorials business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/08/business/economic-calendar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 45, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Calendar", "print_headline": "Economic Calendar", "body_text": " **********Listed below are the target release dates for major economic indicators scheduled to be released this week.

Mr. de Croo was exaggerating a bit to make his point: the lack of competition in Europe, he believes, has pushed airline ticket prices artificially high. **********The situation, however, is rapidly changing. A precedent-setting court decision in April, combined with the ascent of free-market ideology, has made the airline sector the top target of deregulatory efforts in the 12-nation European Community. Despite the efforts of flag carriers to retain their quasi-monopolistic privileges, changes are under way and air fares are beginning a slow fall from their lofty heights. **********Although the type of deregulation being considered in the community falls short of the wide-ranging lead set by the United States, there are similarities. Many Community governments and flag carriers, accustomed to cozy capacity-sharing agreements, fear that unhampered deregulation will lead to market chaos and the bankruptcy of certain airlines. Backers of rapid liberalization, on the other hand, contend that it will lead to cheaper air fares and cost-efficient airlines. 'Potential to Become Dangerous' **********''It's going to be a long battle to achieve the degree of liberalization that I would like to see,'' said Peter Sutherland, the community commissioner responsible for competition policy. ''The matter has the potential to become dangerous.'' **********In April, the European Court of Justice ruled that the Community airline sector was not exempt from antitrust rules in the trade group's founding charter. Then in July, the Community's Executive Commission, which decided to send warning letters to 10 major airlines, threatened to take disciplinary action unless the airlines bean competing with one another. **********''The effect of the letters should be to make people negotiate to bring an end to the breaches that have been occurring,'' Mr. Sutherland said. **********The threat of legal action, along with the uncertainty over the eventual rules of airline competition in the community, has upset many flag carriers. ''How can you build a business if you don't know what you're allowed to do tomorrow,'' said Karl-Heinz Neumister, Secretary General of the Association of European Airlines, the main lobbying group for West European airlines. ''It's impossible.'' **********So far, the 12 Community member states have been unable to decide on a common transportation policy. Britain and the Netherlands, whose national airlines are regarded as tightly run and well prepared for open competition, have tried to convince the other governments to adopt a modest proposal put forward by the commission. **********That proposal, known as Memorandum No. 2, would allow more leeway for airlines to set discount fares and reduce an airline's guaranteed percentage of any given route to 25 percent. Most current capacity-sharing accords guarantee a 50-50 split between two carriers on the same route. New Airlines Not Included **********Robert Schmitz, legal adviser to the European office of Consumer Unions, points out that Memorandum No. 2 does not provide for new airlines to have access to the protected sector. ''It gives a chance to the existing airlines to behave in a more individual way and try to compete a bit,'' he said. ''But the key question has not been dealt with, which is market access for other companies.'' **********Faced with mounting pressure, most of the airlines, backed by their governments, want to control the process. Mr. Neumister said his group favored an informal code of conduct that would essentially allow airlines to take charge of things, instead of the commission, which the airlines seem to view as heavy-handed. **********''You must find a solution which allows all airlines to survive, and, of course, some need more protection than others,'' Mr. Neumister said. He added that a competition policy allowing weak airlines to perish ''wouldn't be a realistic solution.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/business/gaf-ends-carbide-bid-gain-put-at-81-million.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1986-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 990, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GAIN PUT AT $81 MILLION", "print_headline": "GAF ENDS CARBIDE BID; GAIN PUT AT $81 MILLION", "body_text": " **********The battle for the Union Carbide Corporation is over, and so too, it appears, is the war. **********In a move that took few people by surprise, Samuel J. Heyman, head of the GAF Corporation, yesterday backed out of an exceptionally complex fight to take over the giant chemicals company. In withdrawing GAF's offer for Carbide's shares, Mr. Heyman walked away with handsome profits for GAF and for thousands of other Carbide shareholders who sold their stock back under Carbide's counteroffer. **********At the same time, the feisty Mr. Heyman hinted vaguely that he might still resume the fight. The one-time real estate developer broke off an earlier proxy battle for GAF before ultimately winning control of the roofing and chemicals company two years ago. **********But while Wall Street feels that Mr. Heyman's interest in Carbide may continue for a while, mostly because he still owns a big chunk of the company, the consensus is that he will soon turn his attentions elsewhere. Where?  To W. R. Grace & Company, the big chemicals and natural resources producer, according to Wall Street speculation. **********Asked to comment, Mr. Heyman remarked, ''I never comment on market rumors.'' Grace gave almost the identical response. **********If one accepts him at face value, Mr. Heyman wants to transform a little chemical company into a big one. That may explain why Wall Street analysts believe he might take on Grace. Others feel that Mr. Heyman's main interest is profit and that almost any vulnerable company is fair game. **********Until just recently, Grace seemed immune from takeover because the Flick interests of West Germany controlled 26 percent of the company. But last month, when Deutsche Bank announced that it would buy Flick, Grace bought back Flick's stake, eliminating Grace's protector. **********Grace shares advanced 62 1/2 cents yesterday in heavy trading to $48.625. At that price, the company is already worth nearly $2.4 billion. A Complicated Fight **********Yesterday's announcement by Mr. Heyman that he was ending his current campaign for Carbide capped one of the most complicated takeover fights in Wall Street history. **********Four months after announcing that he was investing in Carbide, Mr. Heyman offered last month to pay $68 a share for the company and later raised his bid to $74 in cash. To block him, Carbide countered with an $85-a-share package, but it sought only 55 percent of its stock. The package consisted largely of bonds containing provisions severely limiting the sale of company assets. **********Mr. Heyman then proposed paying $78 a share if Carbide supported him, but Carbide refused, so his offer remained at $74. When Wall Street professionals said that he would have to pay $85 a share to win, or close to $6 billion in cash, he decided yesterday, as widely forecast, that he would withdraw and take his profits. **********He said he was backing out on the understanding that Carbide would go ahead with its $85-a-share offer. **********No agreements or understandings between the parties were announced, but insiders said that Carbide believed that Mr. Heyman's battle for the company had ended. Litigation remained pending but was now regarded as practically dead. 54.4 Million Shares Tendered Carbide said that in response to its offer to buy 38.8 million shares, shareholders ultimately tendered 54.4 million, of which Carbide accepted 71.3 percent. The rest of the stock is being returned to shareholders. **********GAF said that it originally tendered 6,728,000 shares, or 10 percent of the total outstanding, but then took back 1,833,000 to qualify for special tax treatment on its investment. **********GAF said it would show realized and unrealized gains on its investment, before expenses, of $200 million. It added that it would also retain 3.1 million Carbide shares. Because of the Carbide buyback, GAF's stake would still amount to 10 percent of the company's shares outstanding. **********GAF's after-tax gain on the stock, to be reported in the quarter ended March 31, will be $81 million, or $4.50 a share, it said. Both Stocks Drop **********Even though it had expected the battle to fizzle out, Wall Street took the news badly, on a day when traders were in a negative mood over all. GAF, which will no longer make the killing it might have by buying Carbide, slipped $2.625, to $49.25, while Carbide, no longer a takeover target, fell $1.75, to $71.50. **********Even so, Wall Street professionals had bought the bulk of their Carbide shares in the low 60's. Mr. Heyman had bought Carbide stock for an average price of $51. **********In the process, he gained enormous respect among professionals. As expressed by Jeffrey Malet of the American Express Company's IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis, ''When Sam Heyman comes calling again, he will be taken most seriously.'' **********In what could be a hint that he was still interested in Carbide, Mr. Heyman remarked that GAF would ''determine its ultimate course of action in light of events as they unfold.'' **********His original plan, since adopted by Carbide itself, was to sell Carbide's consumer operations. These units are expected to bring at least $2 billion, part of which would be used to pay all stockholders, including GAF, special dividends of at least $33 a share. **********While Carbide insiders argued that GAF's commitments from lenders would not help him take over the rest of the company, Mr. Heyman said, ''I have reason to believe that those commitments will continue to be valid for the next nine months and be available to us if we decide to proceed.'' **********Carbide's new debt-ridden status, meanwhile, prompted Moody's Investors Service to downgrade its credit ratings yesterday on senior debt to BA-3, from BAA-3, and on commercial paper, or corporate i.o.u.'s, to ''not prime'' from ''prime-3.''

Although many analysts expect the overnight Federal funds rate to fall below 8 percent soon, it has remained high in recent days because of unusual flows of funds in the banking system around Dec. 31, which was also the end of a two-week bank reserve accounting period. **********''There are so many distortions around the end of the year that it will not be until after the weekend that you can get a reasonable picture of the funds market,'' said Allan Leslie, a vice president at Discount Corporation of New York. He estimated that, in the near future, the overnight rate for bank loans would average 7 3/4 to 8 percent, or less than the prevailing rate of slightly more than 8 percent of the last few months. **********Fed Timing a Mystery **********But even if the overnight funds rate dropped below 8 percent, analysts said the Fed might not immediately reduce the discount rate it charged on loans to financial institutions. The exact timing of any overt Federal Reserve move to ease monetary policy or reduce the discount rate remains a mystery to securities dealers. **********Pred a change in policy in 1986's first few months are widespread, assuming that economic growth does not rebound strongly from the 3 percent rate recently estimated by the Commerce Department for 1985's fourth quarter. Yesterday's announcements of November increases of 1 percent in factory orders and five-tenths of 1 percent in new construction spending were stronger than expected but not strong enough to suggest rapid economic growth. **********Besides looking at fresh economic data for clues to the Fed's intentions, many economists say that coming changes in the membership of the Federal Reserve Board may contribute to a shift to a more generous monetary policy with lower interest rates. Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, is one of many analysts to conclude that recently appointed members of the Federal Reserve Board will give monetary policy a ''more accommodative tilt'' this year. **********Manuel H. Johnson Jr. and Wayne D. Angell have been nominated to the board but have not yet been approved. They would replace Lyle Gramley and J. Charles Partee. **********The recent hospitalization of Henry Wallich, another Fed governor, has caused much speculation among government securities dealers that President Reagan will soon have the chance to make his fifth appointment to the Fed. President Reagan also appointed Martha Seeger and Preston Martin to the Fed's seven-member board. **********According to Joseph Coyne, a board spokesman, speculation about an appointment for Mr. Wallich is premature. Mr. Coyne said Mr. Wallich had been coming to the office daily for short periods, ''and as time goes on I expect his activities will increase.'' One-Day Security Purchases **********In a day of mostly quiet trading, prices of Treasury notes and bonds were modestly lower at the opening but recovered part of their losses after the Federal Reserve arranged temporary, one-day purchases of securities for its own account. The Fed's action helped reduce the upward pressure on the Federal funds rate but did not provide analysts with any clues about the level of funds trading that would evolve in coming days. **********By late in the day, the new 9 7/8 percent Treasury bonds due in 2015 were offered at 106 2/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 9.27 percent, while the 7 7/8 percent notes due in two years were offered at 99 25/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 8 percent. The long-term bond issue traded around 105 3/4 early yesterday and was as high as 106 14/32 on Monday. **********Rates on Treasury bills rose modestly in sympathy with high rates for overnight bank loans. The three-month issue was bid late in the day at 7.11 percent, up from 7.04 percent. **********Government securities dealers and analysts are reducing their estimates for Treasury borrowings in coming weeks because of extraordinarily heavy sales of special Treasury securities late in the year. State and local governments, which issued record amounts of bonds in late 1985 in advance of proposed changes in Federal tax laws, use the securities to help refund outstanding bonds. **********The Treasury's sales of the special state and local government securities, known as ''slugs,'' accelerated late in the year, with net sales totaling more than $5.4 billion on Dec. 30-31. Sales of slugs are estimated at about $24.75 billion in the last quarter of 1985 (plus $21.4 billion in the first nine months of the year) and are one reason the Treasury was able to reduce the amount of next week's bill auctions to $14.8 billion, from $15.2 billion in previous weeks. **********Analysts at Reid, Thunberg & Company, a Westport, Conn, economic analysis firm, said that the sales of slugs might enable Treasury officials to reduce their public borrowings this quarter to about $46 billion, down from more than $60 billion estimated in late November."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/04/world/strikers-back-at-work-at-bases-in-philippines.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STRIKERS BACK AT WORK AT BASES IN PHILIPPINES", "print_headline": "STRIKERS BACK AT WORK AT BASES IN PHILIPPINES", "body_text": " **********Picketers holding out against a settlement of a 12-day strike at United States bases in the Philippines agreed Wednesday to return to work, saying, ''We have reached the limitations of our power.'' **********More than 1,000 strikers at Subic Bay Naval Station had held out against an agreement reached Monday by union leaders for wage benefits from American officials. **********Earlier Wednesday, strikers returned to work at Clark Air Base and a half-dozen smaller installations. **********A leader of the hard-line picketers, Larry Salazar, said negotiators had reached the end of their leverage.

The breakdown of the talks with the JTL Corporation of Chatanooga, Tenn., will at least slow Coke's plan to spin off its company-owned bottlers into a separate corporation. **********Coke has been overhauling its bottling system by buying franchises, keeping some for itself and selling others. Coke's aim is to weed out weaker bottlers and make them stronger either by managing them itself or combining them with more successful franchisees in the same geographical area.

''It is the passionate wish of the Coca-Cola Company and the Pepsi-Cola Company to put their marketing territories in as much order as money and the F.T.C. will allow,'' said Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry publication. **********The Beatrice deal, if completed, would mark a major step by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, which led a leveraged buyout of Beatrice earlier this year, to pay off the $6.4 billion of debt incurred in that transaction. **********Chicago-based Beatrice is expected to sell other parts of its business as well, although sources close to the company denied reports that a sale of its Tropicana orange juice unit was imminent. The company has already sold its Avis car rental subsidiary for $250 million to the Wesray Capital Corporation. Advertising and Promotion **********Bottlers typically purchase a concentrate from the soft drink company, and mix, package and distribute the final product to stores and vending machines. Bottlers also play a key role in running and financing advertising and promotion programs. **********The Beatrice bottlers account for about 7 percent of Coke's domestic soft drink volume sold in bottles and cans, and they operate in eight Western and Middle Western states and British Columbia. Not including the Beatrice properties, Coke owns bottlers that account for about 11 percent of its domestic volume. JTL, the largest Coke bottler, accounts for about 13 percent. There are about 350 Coke bottlers. **********Coke executives signaled that they would still like to spin off their company-owned bottlers and retain a minority or majority stake in the resulting entity. Such a maneuver would enable Coke to retain some control over the bottlers, while freeing up corporate funds for other purposes and minimizing the debt it would have to take on for any further bottler acquisitions. Several Options **********Coke executives said that among the options being considered were spinning off the bottling operations as a separate, public corporation, or merging them with another large franchisee. Industry analysts also suggested that the deal with JTL could eventually be revived. **********Coke said there was no link between the decision to purchase the Beatrice properties and the end of the talks with JTL. Executives at JTL said the negotiations had been called off because some members of the Lupton family that owns JTL, which was founded in 1896 and is one of Coke's original franchisees, had decided that they wanted to buy out some of the other family members and remain independent. **********''It has nothing to do with Beatrice, nothing to do with the Coca-Cola Company,'' said Stephen I. D'Agostino, president of JTL, who is not a member of the Lupton family. **********Coke said it would finance the Beatrice acquisition through borrowing or a debt offering.

But the three oil ministers meeting here, from Kuwait, Ecuador and Libya, urged that a quota system, restricting output country by country, be continued. They said there was wide agreement within OPEC for such a system, as evidenced in communications sent by members not present. **********The meeting of the three-member committee, which was formed last month, took place as the 13-nation group tried to emerge from the biggest crisis in its 26-year history. 'A Political Commitment **********A price war that began last December sent oil prices from $28 a barrel, to $7 in August. They have now recovered to about $15. **********Ministers here said they believed that the fear caused by near-destruction of the oil group, from cheating on quotas and side deals by members, was so intense that such problems would be avoided in the future. **********''This recommendation means there is a political commitment to OPEC's price system,'' Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister and head of the three-member pricing committee, said in an interview tonight. ''Let me not underestimate the difficulties involved.'' He added, however, that he believed ''the difficulties we have faced in the last year have convinced our members that we cannot continue in an undisciplined manner.'' **********Oil analysts have expressed skepticism that a price agreement alone would be sufficient to buoy oil markets. ''They can't just wish the price up,'' said William L. Randol, an oil analyst at the First Boston Corporation. ''Someone will have to cut production.'' But oil ministers said their new formula - based on price and a promise of production discipline - would be sufficient. **********''We feel that oil markets will respond to a recommendation on price alone at this point,'' said Dr. Fernando Santos Alvite, the deputy oil minister of Ecuador. **********Sheik Sabah said that if OPEC members refused to sell their 17 million barrels of oil a day - more than a third of the non-Communist world's consumption - below $18 a barrel, then prices would rise. At $18 a barrel, a variety of competing supplies from outside OPEC are not economical. **********Tonight's agreement for the first time has tied the price of petroleum to more than one grade of crude oil. In the past, the price was pegged to Saudi Arabian Light. The new price, if accepted, would be based on a basket of seven crude oils: six from OPEC and one from Mexico, an exporter that does not belong to OPEC. **********Sheik Sabah said the new formula would take pressure off a single country to support OPEC's benchmark price and would stabilize the market. Libyan Stance **********Libya had wanted to take dramatic production cuts to raise prices to $28 a barrel, its officials said. ''Eighteen dollars is not a good price for us,'' Fawsi al-Shakshuki, the Libyan oil minister, said in an interview this morning. ''We would go along with $18 to $21 now, but we want to go back to $28.'' **********But Sheik Sabah said Libya agreed in the private meeting today that $18 was a reasonable price and that discussion of $28 could be postponed indefinitely. **********''Twenty-eight dollars is both unrealistic and not in line with the type of stability we would like to give our own countries and consumers,'' he said, adding, ''If $28 becomes an issue in two or three years we will discuss it then.'' Decision to Be Reviewed **********The pricing committee's decision is to be reviewed by OPEC's experts in Vienna next Thursday and by OPEC's production quota committee of Nigeria, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates before all 13 OPEC oil ministers take up the issue in a meeting Dec. 11 in Geneva. **********Sheik Sabah said that an $18 price would be a boon to the depressed American oil industry. That price, he said, would make unnecessary the widely discussed American oil import tax proposal because $18 a barrel would be sufficient to enable United States oil producers to regain profitability. **********Today's meeting, also attended by the minister of Venezuela and OPEC's secretary general from Vienna, was held under tight security on the fifth floor of the Inter-Continental Hotel. **********The attempt to return to a fixed-price system was seen by some oil analysts as proof that OPEC's venture into free-market oil pricing, instituted last December, had largely failed. It did not gain the greater market share that had been expected, although some oil experts said more time was needed. And it seriously weakened the finances of the oil-exporting group. **********The strategy, oil sources said, led to the dismissal by Saudi Arabia two weeks ago of its oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, who proposed the free-market pricing as a way to force higher-cost producers out of the market and stop OPEC members from cheating on their production quotas. **********This meeting is the first since the ouster of Sheik Yamani, who had been the oil group's major figure for many years. Insiders said that the meeting here would not have occurred if Sheik Yamani was still in power. **********But OPEC has been largely unsuccessful. Britain has refused to go along, and Norway and Mexico have made only small cuts. **********Current OPEC production of 17 million barrels a day is 37 percent of the world oil use at about 46.5 million. Oil experts say OPEC will have to cut production by at least 500,000 barrels a day and perhaps up to 2 million to tighten the market enough to raise prices. **********OPEC also faces very high inventories in consuming countries, built up over the past 18 months as prices dropped. There is also the possibility that demand will slacken as prices rise."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/world/the-palme-style-a-strong-tilt-to-foreign-policy.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1986-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1055, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE PALME STYLE: A STRONG TILT TO FOREIGN POLICY", "print_headline": "THE PALME STYLE: A STRONG TILT TO FOREIGN POLICY", "body_text": " **********As the hunt continues for the killer of Olof Palme, the slain Prime Minister is being remembered as a man who balanced a clubhouse feel for domestic politics with a passion to be recognized as a leading international spokesman for European Socialism. **********For 17 years, Mr. Palme's sharp features and sharp tongue held center stage in Sweden's television news programs and newspapers, whether his party was in power, as it was for all but two of those years, or in opposition. **********Fascinated with the charisma and the contradictions of the aristocrat's son turned champion of the working class, Swedes were never sure, however, how well they knew him. **********Indeed, ''Who Is Olof Palme?'' was the title of a best-selling biography published two years ago by a reporter who had known him most of his life. **********Angered U.S. in 1960's **********Starting with the Vietnam War years, when Mr. Palme enraged the United States and captured worldwide attention by welcoming American deserters and draft dodgers, he repeatedly identified Swedish foreign policy with disarmament, friendly relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and backing for Socialist or Communist-led revolutions from Indochina to Nicaragua. **********Mr. Palme also urged Denmark and Norway to leave the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance in favor of a neutral, nuclear-free Scandinavia and campaigned against NATO's deployment of medium-range missiles in Britain, West Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. He further disturbed the United States and its allies by joining the ranks of European Socialist leaders who championed the cause of recognition for Yasir Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********But, thanks to Mr. Palme's outspoken nature, Swedish foreign policy sometimes seemed more antagonistic to the United States than it really was. During the Vietnam War, for instance, even as he criticized American involvement, prompting President Nixon to recall the American Ambassador, Mr. Palme's Government refused to grant official political refugee status to the nearly 1,000 Americans who arrived in Sweden. Americans said they were told that one could not be a refugee from a free country. **********Mr. Palme's internationalism appealed to two popular threads of Swedish thinking. The concept of social solidarity - embodied domestically in the Social Democrats' longstanding drive to eliminate differences in wealth and access to privileges or services - fit comfortably with his calls to support national independence movements that preached Socialism. And his views on disarmament matched the widespread Swedish view of the nation as a peaceful land trapped between two violence-prone superpowers. Served in the Army **********Although sympathetic to pacifists, Mr. Palme served in the army and never opposed the view of the vast majority of Swedes that a strong military was needed to defend the nation's neutrality. He supported the domestic arms industry and its efforts to sell exports to nonaligned nations. **********The political heir of the late Tage Erlander, who led Sweden during the post-war decades in which it became the very symbol of the modern welfare state, Mr. Palme - in the view of many political commentators - never managed to replace his mentor in his countrymen's hearts. **********Mr. Palme's forays into international politicking bothered many Swedes. A growing number of Swedes said Mr. Palme was too quick to criticize the United States and too quiet about such matters as human rights in the Soviet Union, the Soviet military campaign in Afghanistan, the crushing of the Solidarity labor union in Poland, and, above all else, the repeated incursions of Soviet submarines into Swedish waters. **********In addition, the dismal human rights record of some countries that have received large amounts of foreign aid from Mr. Palme's Government, most notably Vietnam, embarrassed many of his countrymen. Development of Welfare State **********Critics also charged that Mr. Palme indulged his passion for foreign policy to mask a lack of interest in domestic affairs. More accurately, his domestic interests were concentrated on developing Sweden's welfare state at a time when economic problems had forced business concerns to the top of the national agenda. **********Under Mr. Erlander and his longtime Finance Minister, Gunnar Streng, who worked closely with the Marcus Wallenburg, the country's leading industrialist, Sweden blossomed into a prosperous industrial state. The large profits generated by private industry were taxed heavily to finance the rapidly expanding social services. **********It was Mr. Palme's fate to preside over the Social Democrats in an era when the strains of earlier growth, coupled with the shock of skyrocketing energy costs, tore apart the old consensus politics. Since 1976, when Mr. Palme led the Social Democrats to their first defeat in 44 years, the country's political balance has hung by a thread. **********Under Mr. Palme, the Social Democrats have clung to their belief that the welfare of society must come before the individual freedom, despite polls showing more and more Swedes feel they have reached the limit of how much they will pay for such solidarity. Government-Business Conflict **********More controversially, Mr. Palme backed a trade union drive to divert a percentage of corporate profits into union-controlled trust funds to be used to buy shares in companies. Mr. Palme's opponents charged that this was a repudiation of the longtime national concensus that Socialism would not extend into business operations. **********Mr. Palme left the country's economic policy largely in the hands of Kjell-Olof Feldt, a tough Finance Minister who earned the respect of business executives while offending many Social Democrats with his budget-cutting efforts and his refusal to bail out failing companies to save jobs. **********Sweden's election last September showed Mr. Palme at the height of his political powers. But a year earlier polls showed him and the Social Democrats trailing. To make matters worse, civil servants went on strike to demand higher pay and money flooded out of the country as financiers began to doubt the Government's will to carry out the budget deficit reductions needed to control inflation. **********But Mr. Palme settled the strike with minimal concessions and rallied his party, which remains one of the most effective political organizations in Europe. Perhaps the image that will stay with most Swedes is the picture of him that September night, the triumphant, domineering survivor of modern Swedish politics, ready to stride once more on the international stage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/business/weapons-deal-alive-for-loral.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1986-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 720, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WEAPONS DEAL ALIVE FOR LORAL", "print_headline": "WEAPONS DEAL ALIVE FOR LORAL", "body_text": " **********The Loral Corporation's takeover bid for Sanders Associates Inc., if it succeeds, would put Loral back in the competition for a huge military contract just after it was eliminated from the field of bidders. **********Wall Street analysts and Government officials said late last week that Loral was a loser and Sanders a winner in a Pentagon decision made on the project the week before. The project, involving the design of an integrated electronic warfare system for future tactical aircraft flown by the Navy and the Air Force, could eventually be worth $8 billion. **********Both companies are major electronics contractors for the military. Loral, based in New York, has made a tender offer of $50 a share, or $980 million, for Sanders, which is based in Nashua, N.H. Sanders, which has advised its shareholders to take no action, is thought by analysts to be looking for a higher bidder. **********Late last month, just before Loral announced its interest in buying Sanders, a team including Loral was eliminated from the warfare system competition. A team that includes Sanders remains in the running for the job, the largest impending project in the rapidly growing electronic warfare market. Bid Linked to Outcome **********''Loral's bid for Sanders was, in part at least, precipitated by this elimination of Loral,'' said one analyst, who asked not to be identified because his firm could be involved in the merger. Loral had been a partner in the competition with a unit of General Motors' Hughes Aircraft subsidiary, while Sanders is teamed with the General Electric Company. **********An attempt was made to reach Loral's chairman, Bernard L. Schwartz, for comment, but he was traveling. **********The analyst, noting that five teams, involving at least 10 large contractors, were seeking the contract, said that a merger by two participants would leave plenty of competition in the marketplace for such devices. **********The integrated electronic warfare system, or Inews, is particularly lucrative because it would combine several instruments, such as warning devices, radar, infrared jammers and radar jammers, into a single package. Previously, such components have been bought separately. **********In early 1989, the Air Force plans to choose between the Sanders-G.E. team and another team, made up of TRW Inc. and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, for further development of the electronics system. When it comes time to produce the system, the winning team will be split into two, preserving competition for the life of the program. Virtual Monopoly **********The proposed takeover of Sanders by Loral raises another question involving competition for military contracts. According to a Navy official, the merger would potentially give the combined company a virtual monopoly on infrared countermeasures systems - a vital device used in high-technology warfare. **********Loral and Sanders are the only major suppliers of these highly classified and increasingly important devices, which seek to thwart heat-seeking missiles and other weapons by disrupting their sensors, a technique known as jamming. **********But Government officials and private analysts said they doubted this issue would block the acquisition of Sanders should Loral's tender offer succeed. **********The Pentagon has no recent history of fighting the increasing trend toward mergers among military contractors, despite its current drive to encourage competition in the marketplace for weapons. **********Glenn Flood, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Defense Department would not analyze the potential anti-competitive aspects of the proposed merger unless it became apparent that shareholders of Sanders would accept Loral's offer. Even if the merger appeared likely to proceed, any decision on whether to fight such an arrangement would rest with the Justice Department. Small Part of Revenues **********If Loral were able to acquire Sanders, however, it might have to agree to spin off the manufacture of the infrared countermeasures systems. The devices account for only a small portion of each company's revenues. **********Rear Adm. Stuart Platt, the Navy's competition advocate, said last week that it would be unwise to allow a single company to monopolize the production of such systems. Sanders manufactures infrared jammers called the ALQ-140, ALQ-144 and ALQ-147; Loral makes the ALQ-123 and ALQ-157. **********The devices, carried on aircraft and ground vehicles, send out confusing signals of infrared light that throw off missiles guided toward heat emissions, such as engine exhausts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/03/business/advertising-procter-drops-y-r.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 577, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Procter Drops Y.&R.", "print_headline": "Advertising; Procter Drops Y.&R.", "body_text": " **********EVER since Procter & Gamble acquired Richardson-Vick last year the advertising community has been waiting for the mighty Cincinnati soaper to dump Young & Rubicam, the rare agency that fled the P.& G. fold. Yesterday it happened.  The New York-based agency has lost billings estimated at $45 million by Leading National Advertisers, an independent media measuring service. **********Additionally, Procter has moved the $16 million Pepto-Bismol business to the Leo Burnett Company, Chicago, from D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, and Metamucil, billing some $6.5 million, to Tatham-Laird & Kudner, Chicago, from Needham Harper Worldwide in New York. **********Needham will also give up Dramamine, a motion sickness remedy, but a new agency has not been selected. **********DFS-Dorland Worldwide, the former Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, which is now part of the Saatchi & Saatchi empire, is also losing $6 million in billings for Encaprin, an analgesic, to an agency yet to be named. **********Robert V. Goldstein, the vice president, advertising, of Procter, was quoted as saying that the moves would help the company operate more efficiently. By some strange coincidence, all the losers, with the exception of Y.& R, have recently been involved in mergers. **********Needham is about to merge with the Doyle Dane Group, placing it in the same holding company as BBDO International. The D'Arcy agency is the result of the merger of D'Arcy MacManus Masius and Benton & Bowles. **********Young & Rubicam's single biggest loss is Oil of Olay, which has a budget of some $28 million. It is also the probable cause of friction between the agency and Procter, the nation's largest national advertiser. **********Some years ago, when the agency was serving the Oil of Olay lotion, it was additionally given an Oil of Olay bar. Procter objected even though the agency was not handling a bar soap from P.& G. Procter reassigned some $16 million in billings that it had at Y.&R. Then the agency did a most unheard of thing: It quit about $50 million of the company's international assignments and within a few days got a huge assignment from Colgate-Palmolive, a fierce rival of P.& G. Procter & Gamble, although a stern taskmaster, has a reputation for treating its agencies fairly and is one of the few advertisers of its size reportedly willing to let its agency keep the whole 15 percent media commission. **********It does not dismiss its agencies. If they have to be disciplined, some brands can be reassigned. The old Biow agency worked for Procter. It closed down, no fault of the soaper. Procter did discharge Papert, Koenig, Lois, but that agency, now defunct, was already on the way to that status when Procter moved. There is some question about how the P.& G.-Doyle Dane Bernbach relationship ended. There are people in both places who say they dismissed the other. **********The rest of the brands leaving Y.& R. are Vicks 44, a cold treatment product that is going to D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles with billings of an estimated $12 million, and Tempo, an antacid billing $5 million that is headed for Leo Burnett. **********What about Saatchi & Saatchi Compton, certainly one of Procter's prime agency resources and one of the first Saatchi acquisitions? Do they go unscathed? It seems as though they do, except if you believe the talk in the street - that it was banking on getting Oil of Olay."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/business/pick-a-card-any-card-every-card.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1986-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3314, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PICK A CARD, ANY CARD, EVERY CARD", "print_headline": "PICK A CARD, ANY CARD, EVERY CARD", "body_text": " **********CREDIT card executives are rubbing their hands with glee now that the Christmas season has begun. Americans have always been big spenders at this time of year and more and more of that spending is being done via credit cards. **********Visa alone expects 200 million purchases to be made on its card between Thanksgiving and Christmas - about 5,340 a minute, totaling $10 billion in charges and huge fees for Visa's member banks. ''Christmas is our final exam,'' said Charles T. Russell, president of Visa International. **********But that exam may soon get harder and harder to pass. The immense profitability of the credit card business is attracting new and stiffer competition, at a time when the 105.5 million Americans who have credit cards already have an average of 6.9 cards apiece, and the creditworthy adults who do not have them show few signs of wanting them. **********''We're very close to the saturation point,'' said Stuart A. Feldstein, president of SMR Research, a business research firm specializing in financial markets, in Budd Lake, N.J. Added Thomas C. Lynch, senior vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, ''There are over 2,000 credit card issuers and the competition is becoming fiercer and fiercer.'' **********Already, the major card issuers are making forays into each other's turf. American Express - the premier non-bank card, with almost 17 million cards outstanding in the United States - is imperiling its traditional snob-appeal by encouraging holders to charge refrigerators and other mundane appliances, with an offer to double manufacturers' warranties. In contrast, MasterCard and Visa both are trying to spiff up their images by issuing premium cards to compete with the American Express Gold and Platinum cards, and they are working to get their cards accepted in high-priced department stores. **********Sears, Roebuck & Company is offering even greater incentives for its year-old Discover card: no annual fee, and a rebate of up to 1 percent on all charges. Customers seem to like the idea. Already there are more than eight million Discover cards in circulation, approaching the nine million bank cards issued by Citicorp, the biggest of the bank issuers. Discover has outpaced the second-ranked Bank of America, with its seven million cards, and third-ranked Chase Manhattan, with 4.2 million cards. **********The competition spells both good and bad news for cardholders. The good news is that the competition is prompting some issuers to offer a variety of incentives, such as discounts on bus fares, termite inspections, vacations, long-distance calls, legal consultations and gasoline. The bad news is that some issuers are resorting to questionable tactics in trying to get people to take their cards; for example, some banks are not making it clear just how much the services actually cost each year. **********But perhaps most important to consumers, and most costly to card issuers, is that interest charges are coming down. Only last week Citicorp cut the rate it charges on its premium cards to 16.8 percent from 19.8 percent. Other big issuers have begun to offer floating rates - tied to Treasury bills or another financial index -that are lower than the prevailing fixed rate of almost 20 percent. In Connecticut, some banks are offering interest rates as low as 11.75 percent. At that rate, the Connecticut National Bank has been adding 1,000 accounts a day, according to SMR Research. **********Even smaller rate drops induce customers to switch cards. ''I switched over to the Dime Savings Bank's Visa because they cut their rate to 16.4 percent,'' said Dr. Robert I. Ashinsky, a Manhattan dentist. His former card had been with the National Westminster Bank, which is charging 19.8 percent, he said. Like many card holders, Dr. Ashinsky generally pays off his cards each month but ''switched for the one or two times that I might make large purchases and want to pay them off over a few months.'' **********Whether rates will keep coming down remains anybody's guess. Dr. Askinsky, like most consumers, says even 16.4 percent is outrageous, ''considering that my business loan is 9 1/2 percent, and I financed my boat with an unsecured installment loan for 14 1/2 percent.'' **********Credit card industry experts insist that interest rates are not the determining factor in consumer acceptance. Most doubt that even the new tax law, which kills the deduction for consumer interest and thus makes credit more expensive in absolute dollars, will have much impact. ''The convenience value of credit cards is so high that people are willing to pay practically any price,'' said Lawrence W. Cohn, bank-stock analyst for Merrill Lynch. STILL, the competition is a signal of trouble ahead for credit card issuers. Many companies are issuing cards to people who as recently as five years ago would have been turned away as poor risks. The result is skyrocketing write-offs from card losses, and often overextension and fiscal hardship on the part of consumers. And even with card issuers scraping the bottom of the credit barrel, growth in new credit card accounts has slowed to less than 5 percent a year nationwide, down from a historical growth rate of 15 percent to 20 percent, said Peter Laqueur, a division executive at Marine Midland Bank. **********The result may be a shakeout, particularly among banks with relatively small numbers of cardholders. Six banks - Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical, Bank of America and First National Bank of Chicago - are responsible for 25 percent of all outstanding bank credit cards, says H. Spencer Nilson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a newsletter for the credit card industry. These big ones are likely to get bigger, while smaller banks will drop out, experts say. ''Eventually all the bank cards will be issued by less than 50 banks,'' Mr. Nilson said. **********But for now, no big issuer is going to leave the field without a fight. Business, though combative, is still good. In fact, the few card issuers that do defect find ready takers for their card businesses. In 1984, when the Continental Illinois National Bank was on the brink of failure, it sold its big credit card operation to the Chemical Bank, at a price of about $150 a card - considered a hefty price in those days. And only weeks ago Mcorp, a Texas-based bank holding company that has been suffering from large loan losses, sold its credit card business to the Lomas & Nettleton Financial Corporation, one of the nation's largest mortgage banking companies, for as much as $364 per account, according to estimates by Mark Biderman of Oppenheimer & Company. **********Card issuers are resorting to gimmicks and even sleight-of-hand tactics to induce Americans to take their cards. The Capital Holding Company of Tilton, N.H., for example, tells potential cardholders that its First Select Visa card carries no annual fee and that holders can ''slash your monthly payments.'' Hidden deep within the promotional material is the fact that Capital charges 21.9 percent interest, about the highest in the country, and that cardholders must take a $1,000 loan, whether they want it or not. The annual cost of that loan comes to $219 - far above the $20 annual fee for most Visas. The monthly payments are lower despite the higher interest rate because Capital requires holders to pay only 2 percent of the outstanding balance each month, rather than the almost 3 percent required at most banks. But the longer it takes to pay off principal, the greater the amount of interest paid, especially at the higher rates. **********Other banks are using a far more benign method of seeking new cardholders: They are asking such groups as the National Rifle Association and B'nai B'rith to endorse the cards and provide mailing lists, usually in return for a commission from the banks. **********But in the struggle for new business, most card issuers are sending out ''preapproved'' applications willy-nilly, based not on the recipient's creditworthiness but on the ZIP code in which he or she lives. The result is that many thousands of cards are winding up in the hands of people who either seek to defraud the issuers or who cannot handle credit, causing credit card losses to soar. According to some estimates, credit card write-offs will approach $4.5 billion worldwide this year, with $3 billion in the United States. Citicorp alone is expected to experience $250 million in bad credit card transactions in 1986. **********''We're seeing more delinquencies and bankruptcies,'' said Marine Midland's Mr. Laqueur. He said many issuers are seeing loss rates of 5 to 6 percent, although he said Marine's ranged between 3 and 4 percent. **********Yet new entrants keep trying to wedge their way into the market. The Shell Oil Company recently introduced its general-purpose Signature Card, and Amoco is offering five different cards, each aimed at different markets and some in conjunction with other card issuers, such as the Citicorp-owned Diner's Club. Household International, too, the big finance company, has introduced what it calls the ''Home Card,'' which combines a MasterCard with an independent home-shopping service known as Comp-U-Card. **********But the biggest and most formidible newcomer remains Sears's Discover card. Sears has already had good acceptance for the Discover card from its 29 million active holders of Sears charge cards - a group that represents more than twice the total holders of any credit card issued by an individual bank. This competition has prompted Visa to run advertisements in trade publications warning banks and merchants against strengthening a competitor - Sears - by doing business with Discover. **********Whether merchants have much to fear is debatable; that other card issuers are right to feel threatened is not. The acceptance rate among potential Discover customers is reported to have been a whopping 17 percent of those solicited; bank mailings nowadays seldom draw a response of more than 1.5 percent, and often attract less than 1 percent. In addition, Sears has patience and seems willing to lose hundreds of millions of dollars to establish the Discover card. This year alone it expects Discover to cost it $115 million. MEANWHILE, American Express has stopped its familiar ''Don't Leave Home Without It'' advertising campaign, which was aimed at its traditional travel and entertainment market, and has begun to urge its customers to charge retail purchases on the card by offering up to an extra year's warranty on the product bought. ''There's a giant opportunity for retail spending,'' said Edwin M. Cooperman, president of the consumer card group within American Express's Travel Related Services division. **********For now, the basic difference between the American Express card and the bank cards is that the banks encourage customers not to pay their bills in full each month so that they can charge interest for the credit extended; American Express asks for prompt payment in full. American Express makes its profits from the $45 annual fee paid by cardholders and from the commissions it charges merchants. ''Many people clearly don't like having revolving credit because they run the risk of spending more than they can pay off,'' said Mr. Cooperman. **********But now many analysts expect American Express, too, to get into the revolving credit business. Mr. Nilson, for one, expects American Express to offer a ''Blue Card'' for people who want to pay in installments. American Express denies that it plans to issue a Blue Card, but it quietly has begun issuing credit on some of its existing cards. For years, its customers have been able to purchase goods on credit through the American Express ''Gold Card,'' but this was done in conjunction with participating commercial banks, which provided the actual credit. When American Express received applications for Gold Cards, it meted them out among the participating banks. But American Express now has its own consumer bank in Delaware, called the Centurion Bank, and now, according to Mr. Cooperman, some of the Gold Card applications are given to Centurion. American Express also has been buying up Gold Card loans from some participating banks and placing them in Centurion. **********In addition, American Express grants credit to holders of its new Platinum Card, which is available for $250 a year to American Express cardholders who had charged at least $10,000 in the previous year. **********But moving into the credit business is a delicate issue for American Express. The company depends heavily on commercial banks to sell its traveler's checks and is reluctant to risk antagonizing these agents by competing with them in the consumer credit business. Perhaps even more critical is the company's fear that it might tarnish the glossy image that surrounds its cards, from green to platinum. Company executives fear that if American Express began acting like an ordinary MasterCard or Visa, some of the magic might wear off. **********Also, despite the relatively high commissions American Express charges merchants, its cards are welcomed at many classy establishments, including better department stores, where the bank cards are not. One theory is that the retailers would rather extend credit on their own cards (most charge higher interest rates than even the bank cards) and fear that they might lose some of this lucrative business if they accepted MasterCards and Visas. In contrast, the American Express card is seen as a convenience card for out-of-towners who want to charge purchases when traveling. If it suddenly started to allow holders to finance their purchases, it would compete directly with the store cards. THE bank cards, meanwhile, are trying to get those department stores to give up their antipathy to credit cards not their own. MasterCard and Visa, usually bitter competitors, have teamed up in an effort to woo big department stores and expensive restaurants around the country. ''We'd better get out and correct some of the problems,'' said Russell E. Hogg, president and chief executive officer of MasterCard International, speaking of what he calls ''holdouts in the retail area.'' **********Part of the problem, according to Mr. Hogg, is that the bank cards have had a blue-collar image and American Express has appealed to wealthier people and bigger spenders. But he claims that is changing, giving MasterCard and Visa a better chance of penetrating the American Express domain. ''Our research shows that people don't put themselves into categories - blue collar, et cetera,'' said Mr. Hogg. **********The bank cards scored a major success recently when they signed up Bloomingdale's. Three Florida-based Bloomingdale's stores already are accepting MasterCard and Visa, and the New York stores expect to begin accepting them in January. But Mr. Hogg has further to go. ''The phone rings off the hook when the Japanese get here and can't use their MasterCards in Macy's,'' he said. **********Yet snob appeal seems to remain a mighty factor in the charge-card business. ''I would be embarrassed to use a MasterCard in a good restaurant,'' said a New Yorker, who cherishes his American Express card. And that helps account for the 100,000 or so people who carry the American Express Platinum Card. **********Visa and MasterCard also have issued premium cards, charging a significantly higher annual fee for them. In reality, however, the practical differences between the premium and the standard cards are small. In fact, Citicorp attributed the recent combination of interest-rate reductions and fee increases on its premium cards to an attempt to create a difference between it and its standard cards. Under the new price structure, people who owe less than $1,000 on their cards would find it cheaper to take the standard card with its $20 annual fee and 19.8 percent rate, than the premium card with a $50 fee and a 16.8 percent rate. If the average amount owed were $1,000, the annual cost of either cards would be the same - $218. **********Right now, the Visa and MasterCard banks seem to view American Express as their greatest threat. While agreeing that Sears' Discover card could pose a major threat in the future, most bankers say they do not feel its impact yet and suggest that most of the purchases charged on the Discover card are being made in Sears stores. Sears denies that. ''The vast majority of usage is outside Sears stores,'' said Donna Peterman, a spokesman for the Discover card. **********But no one denies there is a free-for-all in the card business. ''There's encroachment on all sides and everyone is invading everyone else's turf,'' said Mr. Lynch of Chase. In his view, ''the clear winner is the consumer.'' TRACKING ATRANSACTION **********Most people have heard of Visa and MasterCard, but few have given much thought to the complex system that sits behind those cards. To illustrate that system, let us follow a typical transaction by a typical cardholder, say, Mary Smith. **********Fictional Mary lives in New York and has a MasterCard issued by a New York bank. She takes a trip to Los Angeles and buys a $75 pocketbook that she pays for with her MasterCard, a non-profit operation that links its member banks and their merchants together electronically. **********To start the payments process, the store must get approval from Mary's bank, either by telephone or electronically. If done electronically, her card is passed, or ''swiped,'' through a small terminal called a MAPP, for MasterCard Automated Point-of-Sale Program. The MAPP reads the magnetic strip on the card and sends the information - the name of Mary's New York bank, her account number and the amount to be charged - to the store's bank in Los Angeles. Another small computer at the L.A. bank, called a MIP - for Member Interface Processor - reads the message and sends it to the computer at Mary's New York bank, and the approval is relayed back to the store in Los Angeles. **********At the end of the day, MasterCard's computers calculate how much each member bank must pay or collect from the system, and the amounts are cleared through an account at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company in New York. **********MasterCard is supported by a system of fees. Each bank pays the MasterCard system 95 cents for each $1,000 of its cardholders' transactions. An ''interchange fee'' also is paid by the merchant's bank to the cardholder's bank. Jeffrey Kutler, a credit-card specialist at the American Banker, a trade paper, said that for transactions not done electronically, the fee is 1.5 percent of the amount of the transaction, plus 7 cents. For electronic transactions, the fee is 1 percent plus 7 cents. **********There are other fees as well. For example, to list a card as lost or stolen, a bank must pay anywhere from 50 cents to $16.50, depending on the number of directories in which the listing is entered. **********But it is the consumer and the merchants who ultimately foot the bills. If, for example, Mary charged $100 on her MasterCard, Mary's bank would give that amount to the merchant's bank. The merchant would receive only between $96 and $98 from its bank, a discount of between 2 percent and 4 percent and representing the gross profit to the merchant's bank. Very big merchants, such as major airlines, might be able to whittle the discount down to 1.5 percent, Mr. Kutler said. **********For her part, Mary pays her annual fee to her bank, which generally ranges from $20 for standard MasterCards to $50 for premium cards. And if Mary chooses not to pay her bill in full when she receives it from her bank, she also would be charged interest, usually at a rate of almost 20 percent. As calculated by Citicorp, if her average balance were $1,000, the annual cost of using her Citicorp MasterCard would be $218."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/11/business/patents-laseraimed-sighting-for-a-ballistic-weapon.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1986-01-11", "snippet": "A laser-aimed sighting system for a ballistic weapon, patented this week for the United Technologies Corporation, Hartford, is described as operating with an exceptionally high degree of accuracy.", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PATENTS;\nLaser-Aimed Sighting For a Ballistic Weapon", "print_headline": "PATENTS;\nLaser-Aimed Sighting For a Ballistic Weapon", "body_text": " **********A laser-aimed sighting system for a ballistic weapon, patented this week for the United Technologies Corporation, Hartford, is described as operating with an exceptionally high degree of accuracy. **********Patent 4,562,769 was granted Hans A.

''Before the Florida economy turned up, the bank stocks went up,'' he said. ''All that has to happen for the farm banks to report reasonable results is for the situation to stop deteriorating.'' Mr. Perkins believes that it has. **********In the first quarter, First of Iowa reported a loss of two cents a share, versus a 15 cent loss a year earlier. For the year, Mr. Perkins looks for ''break-even to a slight loss -plus or minus 10 cents.'' The company lost 86 cents a share in 1985.

''Almost every other paragraph contains assurances that 'rumors' spreading in Estonia are greatly exaggerated.'' **********Mr. Ilves related that the last article by a reporter named Tonis Avikson, who visited the contaminated site, said that the series would be continued, but that it has not been. Taken in the Night **********Mr. Avikson reported that a group of 200 to 300 Estonian men were embittered over having been taken, ''often in the night,'' and sent to a site in the Ukraine near the Chernobyl plant, where they were obliged to wash houses and trees and strip contaminated topsoil, replacing it with imported topsoil. He described their mood as one of ''indignation, extreme bitterness and despair.'' **********The workday, according one article, stretched from 6 A.M. until 8 P.M., with only two days of rest in a month. A number of the reservists, who were from different parts of the Soviet Union, had become sick because of radiation poisoning and because they were spending cold nights in makeshift tents at the end of scorching days. **********Some time in June the Estonian reservists were informed that their two-month tour of duty had been extended to six months, and they gathered angrily en masse to demand an explanation, according to the report. This led to a vaguely described scuffle ''in which someone was grabbed by the collar as well as some jabbing of knees into buttocks and throwing of sand,'' Mr. Avikson reported. **********''Otherwise no force was used,'' wrote the Estonian journalist, who was sent to write in July about the situation among his compatriots at the Chernobyl clean-up site. ''So said the men themselves, even though at home there are stories of larger fights.'' 'Uprising or Strike' **********This confrontation led to a work stoppage that seems to have extended into July. Mr. Avikson, however, insisted that ''the uprising or the strike or whatever else it was being called at home, based on information in the men's letters to Estonia, was extremely exaggerated.'' **********''In the beginning,'' the Estonian journalist explained, according to Mr. Ilves's translations, ''the news about the extension ruined the men's willingness to work, creating a psychologically explosive situation. For a while some men simply stood idle, having worked like oxen before. The normal work rhythm was restored bit by bit, and by the time we were there in mid-July everything in this respect was back in order.'' **********Mr. Avikson wrote that elsewhere ''a man can choose whether to try to 'teach' his brutalizer a lesson or simply leave.'' **********''At Chernobyl he has nowhere to go and can only choose to swallow his bitter fate,'' he added. **********The reservists ''work in uniform, with face masks to protect their breathing passages,'' as all workers there do, according to one article. Most of the Estonians were said to have been in what was described as the second and third zones, ''where the situation is relatively less dangerous.'' Volunteers for Pripyat **********The article continued: ''Only some individual volunteers will go once, for example, to Pripyat'' - the town near the Chernobyl plant, presumably in the first zone - ''where the radiation level is still high. In one shift they can receive a dose that results in their being sent home.'' **********Overexposure to radiation and other health problems resulted in ''a sufficient number of Estonians'' being sent home before their six-month tour was over, one article recounted. Similarly, reservists over the age of 45 or fathers of ''three or more underage children, all of whom live together,'' were allowed to return to Estonia. **********The reservists, from the journalist's account, feared that they might become sterile from the radiation. ''More than several men,'' Mr. Avikson reported, ''were worried that plans made with a girl or a recent bride just before departure could in this confused world easily go awry.'' **********The articles were unusually candid for the Soviet press. Many Estonians routinely watch Finnish television, and thus are likely to have heard Western news reports about the accident. Estonia is one of the most Westernized of the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics, and nationalism runs high there; Estonians have worked hard to preserve their language, which is related to Finnish and not to Russian, and to maintain cultural distinctions. **********Mr. Ilves said that first-hand reports from Estonia suggested that not many reservists had been recruited from Tallinn, the republic's capital, for clean-up duty around the Chernobyl reactor.

The Dow Jones industrial average, which fell slightly on Monday, lost another 11.81 points, to 1,914.37. **********The tax selling had a more significant impact on trading volume, especially since the swaps that were going on meant that investors would both have to buy and sell stocks, creating a double impact on turnover. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, where the tape that reports trades was running as much as 10 minutes late during the afternoon, 188.7 million shares changed hands.

Billions Change Hands **********This year, the rush to streamline and to concentrate energies on more narrowly defined lines of business has fueled a record of more than $150 billion in mergers and acquisitions that transferred corporate assets from one set of hands to another. **********In addition, according to the investment banking firm of Salomon Brothers Inc., in the first 11 months of 1986 some 233 companies bought back, or announced plans to buy back, an estimated $36 billion of their own stock, making themselves less vulnerable to takeovers. **********''Deal-making activity has been very strong in recent years,'' said Martin Sikora, editor of the Philadelphia-based Mergers & Acquisitions magazine. ''But what we are seeing now is mind-blowing.'' **********The merger trend has hit the retailing, airline and communications industries the hardest. **********Among the big deals of the year were May Department Stores' $2.4 billion acquisition of the Associated Dry Goods Corporation, which operates some of the nation's largest department stores; the General Electric Company's $6.28 billion purchase of the RCA Corporation; the Texas Air Corporation's $676 million acquisition of Eastern Air Lines Inc. and its agreement to buy People Express for $115.8 million, and the Burroughs Corporation's $4.4 billion purchase of the Sperry Corporation, a combination that was rechristened Unisys. No End in Sight **********Most experts believe that the current wave will continue through 1987. They predict that interest rates will stay relatively low, thus keeping down the cost of financing takeovers. They also expect that the amount of money available for putting together these deals will remain ample and that foreign buyers of American companies will become even more numerous. **********''There is reason to believe that reorganization activity will be even higher for all of 1987 than it was in 1986,'' Salomon Brothers said in its recently published ''Prospects for Financial Markets in 1987.'' **********''There's a lot of smart money out there looking for deals,'' said Robert H. Lessin, managing director at Morgan Stanley & Company. ''And in 1987, most of the conditions are expected to be the same. So we are looking for another active year.'' Huge Levels of Debt **********At the same time, however, there is growing concern that corporations are taking on huge and previously unknown levels of debt to make acquisitions or to buy back their own shares. **********The shuffle of assets is rooted in the widespread belief by company directors that they must act fast to ward off threats to their corporations' very survival. On one front, they are fending off financial entrepreneurs who want to take them over, dismember them and sell off the parts. On another, foreign competition is luring customers away with lower prices and, oftentimes, better products. **********''Ten years ago, the mission of management was expanding the corporation,'' said John J. Nevin, chairman of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. ''Today, managers are more aware they've got to generate wealth for their shareholders or they will be in jeopardy of losing control.'' Diversification Trend Reverses **********Much of this feverish activity is an undoing of the diversification move that swept corporate America in the late 1960's and early 1970's and the formerly strict enforcement of antitrust laws that often made mergers between companies in the same field difficult, thereby encouraging ambitious companies to acquire unrelated businesses. **********But managing such broad empires has proved to be difficult, and the stock market has generally penalized diversified corporations in comparison with companies that are ''pure plays'' - those that concentrate on succeeding in a single line of business. This has pushed many businesses to shed unrelated units and invest instead in their core business. Past Mergers Are Unraveling **********The USX Corporation, formerly United States Steel, has been discussing a spin-off of its energy holdings, including the Marathon Oil Company, which it acquired in a celebrated takeover fight in the early 1980's. **********And Dart & Kraft Inc. announced this year that it was undoing its merger of six years ago, on the theory that the stock market would value the two halves more highly than the combination of food and industrial products created by the merger. **********All of this activity is expected to result in some 3,600 deals this year, Mr. Sikora, of Mergers & Acquisitions, said. Of this amount, divestitures alone are likely to exceed the 1,218 of 1985, according to the Chicago-based W. T. Grimm & Company. **********Altogether, it is expected that there will be between $150 billion and $175 billion of merger and acquisition activity where the dollar amount of the deal is disclosed. As many as 1,500 of the 3,600 deals, however, are between private companies where there is no requirement for disclosure, so the actual dollar volume will be considerably higher. A 'Window of Opportunity' **********The Reagan Administration's relatively permissive attitude toward antitrust laws - and the fear that this approach might change under a different administration - has also inspired mergers of companies in the same business. Corporations are viewing this Administration's stance as a ''window of opportunity'' that may close after the next election. **********As a result, companies such as rival tire giants Goodrich and Uniroyal have merged or formed joint operations this year. The world's largest chemical company was created by the $2.8 billion purchase of the Celanese Corporation by the German-based Hoechst A.G.. Fear of Raiders Spreads **********But more than a changed antitrust attitude, much of the current restructuring is motivated by fears of a raid. There has been growing recognition that the stock market value of many target companies was far less than what the companies' parts were worth separately. **********In one example of a concern that was acquired and then largely dismantled, Anderson, Clayton & Company was bought by Quaker Oats, which sold off all of Anderson, Clayton's businesses except its Gaines pet food division. **********Helping the raiders to finance takeovers has been the explosive growth of high-yield ''junk bonds'' - securities issued at less than investment grade that often provide the financing for takeovers. The broad market for these bonds has created a new class of financial entrepreneurs, men such as Sir James Goldsmith and Ronald O. Perelman who are following in the footsteps of first-generation raiders such as Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens. **********This year, an estimated $29.8 billion of junk bonds had been issued through Dec. 3, according to McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei's Corporate Watch news service. Profits for Perelman **********Mr. Perelman, who made clear in 1985 that his $2.7 billion deal for the Revlon Group Inc., the giant cosmetics concern, would not be his last corporate attack, emerged as the most persistent raider of 1986. **********After he bought 15 percent of the Transworld Corporation, the hotel and food service company decided it would rather liquidate than capitulate. He then bought 5 percent of CPC International - which caused the food products company to announce a restructuring and the purchase of Mr. Perelman's holdings, giving him $40 million in profit. Mr. Perelman then made a $4.1 billion offer for the Gillette Company, which responded with a restructuring plan and bought up his stock holdings in the company for $558 million. **********On another front, corporations were taking defensive steps to thwart takeovers by taking advantage of low borrowing costs to issue debt in order to buy back their own shares. Such stock buybacks make it more difficult for a raider to acquire shares, and also provide an immediate boost to corporate earnings -and, ideally, to a corporation's stock price. Alarm Over Corporate Debt **********There are some who are concerned that the willingness of corporate managers to fend off real - or anticipated - raiders by borrowing heavily to pay for stock buybacks is leading to dangerous levels of debt. **********The Federal Reserve Board reports that equity on corporate balance sheets has shrunk by $207.3 billion since the end of 1983, while corporate debt has risen from $1.27 trillion to $1.78 trillion. **********''Everyone says what this country needs is a lot more investment,'' said Felix G. Rohatyn, a partner at Lazard Freres & Company. ''But what we're seeing is disinvestment and the creation of liabilities against future investment. I don't think that's in the national interest.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/29/business/net-triples-at-morgan.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1986-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 317, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Net Triples At Morgan", "print_headline": "Net Triples At Morgan", "body_text": " **********The Morgan Stanley Group Inc., the 51-year-old investment banking company, made its first earnings report as a public company yesterday, announcing that its first-quarter net income had more than tripled, fueled by rallies in the financial markets. **********Morgan Stanley, which sold shares to the public during the first quarter, said its net income soared to $58 million, or $2.92 a share, from $17.8 million, or the equivalent of 89 cents a share, the year before, when it was still a private corporation. **********Revenues jumped 51.4 percent, to $589.6 million, from $389.5 million in the first quarter of 1985. **********Brenda D.

Davis, 31 years old, decided to change his investment strategy. Mr. Davis, a director of a medical laboratory in Brooklyn, who had previously dabbled in I.B.M. and some other blue-chip stocks, as well as a domestic mutual fund, moved everything to the Fidelity Overseas Fund, a mutual fund that currently is heavily invested in Japanese securities. **********Since the move, he has seen a 30 percent rise in the value of his original investment. ''It's like having the best of both worlds,'' he said. ''I live and work in America. But if the outlook is better for yen-denominated investments, I come out ahead.'' **********The reasons for the strong returns have been twofold. First, a number of overseas markets have done exceptionally well. Second, the dollar has been falling since February 1985, after an almost five-year rise. As the dollar has fallen, foreign currencies have risen in value, and this has increased the value of investments denominated in foreign currencies for Americans. **********Since September 1985, when the five major Western industrial powers agreed to drive down the value of the dollar to ease trade imbalances, the dollar has fallen at a stunning rate -some 40 percent against the West German mark, and 50 percent against the yen. But today many currency experts doubt the dollar will fall much more. That means that gains in overseas investments will not be so easy in upcoming months. **********''A year ago, you could have invested in anything overseas,'' said Ezra Zask, vice president in corporate foreign exchange for the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''With at least a 30 percent depreciation of the dollar, you still came out way ahead. But I don't think you can count on that anymore. Investing abroad might take more sophistication than before.'' **********Mr. Zask, along with a number of other currency experts, predicted the dollar could slide an additional 10 percent against the West German mark during the next six months. But most experts agree the declines will not exceed this amount. **********''Maybe there will be a further 10 percent depreciation, but that would be about it,'' said Joshua Shapiro, an economist with International Treasury Consulting Inc., a New York concern that advises multinationals about currency exchange matters. **********''For individuals to time investments by themselves at this stage, they would need very good information. If they were to have somebody else do it, as in a mutual fund, they would have to understand that a lot of the falling currency action has already happened. Just like at the end of any long trend - you risk that you've waited too long,'' said Mr. Shapiro. **********''I think the dollar will go 7 to 10 percent lower in the next six months, but it will be at a slower pace,'' said Michael J. Malpede, senior currency analyst at Refco Inc., a Chicago-based commodities brokerage firm. **********For those who still want to invest abroad, there are a variety of ways to do so. Investors can open an account with a foreign brokerage directly. Or, although it is more speculative, they can simply purchase foreign money in the hope it will rise in value. They can also buy foreign stocks that are listed here and trade through American Depository Receipts. Or investors can trade abroad through an American broker. **********Participating in direct overseas investments can have its risks - to begin with it adds market risk to currency risk. And the rules of some foreign markets can seem far more complicated to those who are accustomed to dealing with United States markets. Disclosure requirements can vary considerably. The time it takes to settle transactions can also vary from country to country, and commission costs in trading the foreign securities are also often higher. **********The problem of currency fluctuations was dramatized in September, when the currency markets experienced sudden volatility as a result of political bickering among the five major industrialized countries. **********''The political battles between Europe, the United States and Japan made the currency markets extremely choppy and unpredictable,'' said Mr. Zask of Manufacturers Hanover. ''At times the currencies may not follow economic fundamentals, but rather the political environment. This makes it hard for professionals to find direction, much less individual investors.'' **********The most common and the least risky approach to investing abroad is through mutual funds with overseas portfolios. **********''I figured that oil prices would stay down,'' said Mr. Davis, explaining why he turned to an international mutual fund. ''I thought that low oil prices would have to be good for Japan, which is a highly industrialized country that produces no oil; it can only benefit from the low prices. So, I began looking for a fund I could use to invest in Japan.'' **********The international funds have done particularly well in the last year and a half. **********''Up to the end of 1984, and for the five years previous to that, investing in foreign funds was not such a good idea. Most profits you made you gave back because of the foreign currency depreciation,'' said George L. Noble, portfolio manager for the Fidelity Overseas Fund. ''But the last 18 months have been the best of all worlds.'' **********International mutual funds, which invest in securities whose primary trading markets are abroad, gained an overall value of more than 43 percent in the first three quarters of 1986, according to Lipper Analytical Services. **********The Fidelity fund that Mr. Davis chose ranked fourth during the first three quarters in the Lipper Analytical Survey. Its value rose by 78 percent last year, and in the first three quarters of 1986 the fund rose about 65 percent, Mr. Noble said. **********Of the top 10 fund performances during the first three quarters, eight were international or global funds, which meant they invested at least 25 percent of their portfolio in overseas securities. Two of the top international funds were the G.T. Pacific Growth Fund, which increased 76 percent, and the Merrill Lynch Pacific Fund, up 70 percent. **********Even though many currency experts believe the bulk of the dollar's depreciation has already occurred, portfolio managers of international funds still say that investments can be found. **********''The Japanese market is less volatile than the United States, and the changing value of the currency adds volatility to the return of the Japanese market,'' said Stephen I. Silverman, portfolio manager of Merrill Lynch's Pacific Fund, whose assets have grown from $105 million at the end of 1984 to $445 million today. He has more than 75 percent of the fund's assets in Japanese securities, many of them insurers. ''There are always areas in which to find investments,'' Mr. Silverman said. **********Mr. Noble, of Fidelity's Overseas Fund, while agreeing with the other currency experts that the dollar may fall only 10 percent during the next six months, still sees good returns abroad. **********''I'm bullish on foreign markets,'' he said. ''I think you can make more money abroad than at home, because the fundamentals are better abroad. It doesn't mean if Wall Street drops, overseas markets won't do the same. But the overseas markets will outperform the United States regardless. And you'll still get the added boost from the currency.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/26/business/texas-instruments-is-back-in-the-black.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1986-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 305, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEXAS INSTRUMENTS IS BACK IN THE BLACK", "print_headline": "TEXAS INSTRUMENTS IS BACK IN THE BLACK", "body_text": " **********Texas Instruments Inc. said today that its growing military electronics business helped offset a sharp sales drop at its oilfield-service unit in the second quarter, enabling it to post a profit of $12.3 million, or 35 cents a share, in the period. **********It was the first profit for the company, which has attempted to cut costs across its varied business lines, since the first quarter of 1985. **********It lost $3.9 million in the quarter a year ago. **********Moreover, the $27.6 million operating profit in the quarter represented a sharp improvement from last year's low point, an operating loss of $44.1 million in the third quarter. **********Sales, however, were flat at $1.24 billion, and the company noted that semiconductor sales slowed late in the quarter, which ended June 30.

Tax benefits under the J-51 program are available for residential conversions without special approvals only if the post-conversion assessment does not exceed $38,000 per apartment. This is the case in most of Brooklyn. **********The first and largest of the conversions of industrial buildings took place several years ago at the Doehler Dye building, a 10-story property at 515 Court Street. Salvatore Scotto, president of the Carroll Gardens Association, estimated that since then at least 300 additional housing units have been created in conversions of nonresidential properties in Carroll Gardens. **********Now another conversion project is nearing completion in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, one block from the Cobble Hill historic district. It is providing fresh evidence of the role of conversions in strengthening older neighborhoods and affording wider housing opportunities for middle-income New Yorkers. In South Brooklyn, conversions are producing housing that can be sold as condominiums for $180 to $250 a square foot. At $200 a square foot, a generous-sized one-bedroom apartment might sell for about $180,000. **********The Carroll Gardens project, called Henry Street Mews, illustrates the inventiveness in planning and design that can be brought to conversion projects. It is being developed by Henry Street Mews Associates, a partnership of Morton Joffe, Jules Litvak and William Jaeger, real estate and construction professionals based in Manhattan. **********The project, scheduled for fall occupancy, includes five buildings, four of them part of a former midblock industrial property running from Sackett Street to DeGraw Street. **********After acquiring the buildings last year, the developers enlarged the site with the purchase of an abutting property with 20 feet of frontage on Henry Street. In addition to more apartments, this provided for a grand entrance to the entire complex through a skylighted promenade at 492 Henry Street. **********The promenade leads to a private garden and sitting area, which is surrounded by interior terraces of the apartments in the midrise elevator buildings on the side streets. There are 60 apartments in all, several offering panoramic views across the low-rise town houses of the community to the waterfront and beyond. **********As is frequent in conversions, the apartment sizes and shapes are diverse. Thus there are not only studio apartments but also studios with ''dens'' that cannot be described under zoning law as separate rooms because of inadequate lighting. Similarly, there are one-bedroom apartments and one-bedrooms with dens. The architect was the Architects Design Studio. Walz Design Inc. assisted in planning public spaces. **********Sales prices, which the developer says average about $210 a square foot, range from $100,000 to $144,000 for studios; $134,000 to $190,000 for studios with dens; $145,000 to $230,000 for one-bedrooms; $199,000 to $300,000 for one-bedrooms with dens, and $199,000 to $280,000 for two-bedrooms. Prices are influenced by the amount and placement of terrace or roof space that goes with an apartment. **********Thanks to the J-51 abatement, however, buyers' carrying costs - the sum of debt service, maintenance and tax expenses - can be held down. Excluding debt service costs, buyers at Henry Street Mews will pay $137 a month for the studio apartment; $184 for the studio with a den; $199 for the one-bedroom, and $274 both for the one-bedroom with a den and for the two-bedroom. **********Both in Cobble Hill and in Carroll Gardens there has been a surge in cooperative conversion of older four-story walk-ups - the typical housing type - since the late 1970's. Floor-through apartments in brownstone-like buildings typically range in price from $130,000 to $160,000, and sometimes reach $180,000 or higher, depending on the quality of the apartment and the block, brokers report. **********For Henry Street Mews, Rottenstein & Golowa Ltd., a consulting firm, has estimated that the post-conversion assessment will work out to about $30,600 an apartment. In that case, it would probably pay no taxes for 12 years, because the work is so extensive that it will qualify for a significant abatement of existing taxes on the old structure, as well as exemption from taxes attributable to the rehabilitation. **********But if there were no J-51 benefit, taxes under the city's current rate probably would be about $168,000 a year, or an average of $2,800 a year per condominium owner. That would add an average of $233 a month to housing costs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/01/business/patents-method-of-producing-industrial-lubricant.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1986-02-01", "snippet": "The Cetus Corporation of Emeryville, Calif., a leading genetic engineering company, received a patent this week for a method of producing long-chain wax esters, compounds that have applications in steelmaking and other industrial operations.", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PATENTS;\nMethod of Producing Industrial Lubricant", "print_headline": "PATENTS;\nMethod of Producing Industrial Lubricant", "body_text": " **********The Cetus Corporation of Emeryville, Calif., a leading genetic engineering company, received a patent this week for a method of producing long-chain wax esters, compounds that have applications in steelmaking and other industrial operations. **********The process includes incubating a species of microorganism in the presence of alcohol as its principal food source. **********The inventors named in patent 4,567,144 are Saul L.

Marcelo Alonso, a Cuban-born physicist who monitors the Cuban nuclear program, said the Cuban Government had indicated it expected the first of what it said would eventually be four units to go into operation sometime next year, and a second in 1989. **********Nuclear energy experts and specialists in Cuban affairs said the reactors under construction were not of the graphite core type, in contrast to the one at Chernobyl in the Ukraine, where earlier this week a major nuclear accident was acknowledged. Like most recent Soviet export reactors, the units being installed in Cuba are pressurized water reactors apparently being equipped with containment shells, they said. **********Experts added, however, that there were numerous unanswered questions about the possible risks posed by the Cuban project. These include training procedures for Cuban personnel, the site's location in a coastal area frequently swept by hurricanes and the absence of some safety features that are standard in the United States and Europe. Likelihood of Danger Cited **********''If something happens, it would pose quite a dangerous situation for the United States,'' said Dr. Behram Kursunoglu, a physicist who heads the University of Miami's Center for Theoretical Studies. ''It would depend on the nature of the accident, but atmospheric and water currents are such that a release of radioactivity would affect us.'' **********Roland Draxler, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington said because ''prevailing winds flow off the Gulf of Mexico,'' a nuclear accident in Cuba ''could have some influence over'' the Southeastern states, especially if it were to occur during the hurricane season. **********In a speech delivered to the First National Forum on Energy in December 1984, Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, said four reactors of 440 megawatts each had been ordered from the Soviet Union in order to economize on the use of oil and coal. ''Our future development must be based on nuclear plants,'' Mr. Castro told the conference. **********Earlier, in an address at Cienfuegos in July 1984, Mr. Castro said the reactors, called Jaragua I and II, would be earthquake-proof, able to withstand hurricanes or a tidal wave 100-feet high, and protected against an airplane accident by ''a much larger quantity of concrete and steel in construction.'' Castro Comments on Design **********''The plant has been designed and is being built with every safeguard,'' Mr. Castro assured his audience. ''Every theoretical risk has been taken into account,'' he added. **********Mr. Castro said that 5,500 construction workers, 188 ''Soviet advisers'' and a ''Bulgarian construction brigade'' of 82 were engaged in the construction of the Jaragua complex. A permanent town with 4,500 housing units was also being built at the site, he said. **********In his speech in December 1984, Mr. Castro again discussed the possibility of nuclear contamination or accident, but said these were problems limited to capitalist societies ''seeking to cut corners and costs.'' **********''Fortunately, we rely on Soviet technology,'' he said, arguing that ''a sense of responsibility'' and ''all the responsiblity the socialist state can muster goes into technological progress with safety.'' Standard Features Discussed **********American nuclear industry experts said yesterday that Soviet pressurized water reactors of the type being installed in Cuba have in recent years incorporated many of the features standard in American reactors, but that significant differences remain. **********''They have the fundamental features ours do, but ours have more redundancies as a result of Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements since Three Mile Island,'' said Robert M. Jefferson, a New Mexico-based nuclear consultant who monitors Eastern Bloc nuclear programs. ''And who knows what the level of their operator training is?'' **********Several analysts also said the Soviets have had virtually no experience building reactors in climate and terrain similar to Cuba's. The Jaragua complex, near a Cuban naval base, apparently will use ocean water as a coolant for the reactor's condenser, raising the possibility, however remote, of contamination of the surrounding waters. **********''With an American system, I would say they would have no problem, since we have designed reactors to withstand hurricane force winds of over 100 miles an hour,'' said Lynn Wallis, a physicist and chairman of the American Nuclear Society Public Information Committee.

I just don't know.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/25/world/seoul-eases-stand-against-dissidents.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1986-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 866, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEOUL EASES STAND AGAINST DISSIDENTS", "print_headline": "SEOUL EASES STAND AGAINST DISSIDENTS", "body_text": " **********In a sudden and unexplained shift, South Korea's President appeared today to retreat from a crackdown on opposition politicians. **********He held a lunch meeting with key opposition leaders and allowed them to convene a party meeting that the police forcibly blocked a few days ago. **********At the 2-hour-50-minute meeting at the presidential residence today, President Chun Doo Hwan told the presidents of South Korea's ruling party and the two major opposition parties that he believed the police had overreacted in cordoning off entrances to opposition party headquarters and placing nearly 300 opposition party members under house arrest last Thursday. **********According to a high-ranking official in the President's office, Mr. Chun said that in the future such ''frictions'' should not be repeated. **********At the meeting, Mr. Chun outlined several proposals in an attempt to break a deadlock over a banned opposition petition drive to amend the nation's Constitution to permit direct presidential elections. For the first time, Mr. Chun committed his party to support constitutional revision, although he said that any changes must wait until after the presidential elections and the Seoul Olympics, both in 1988, and he did not specifically pledge to permit direct elections. **********He proposed establishing two commissions, one in the Administration and one in the Parliament, to study the issue, the presidential official said. **********Spokesmen for both the Government and the opposition said that the proposals represented a major departure from Mr. Chun's previous stance, which precluded all debate on the issue until 1989. But the meeting produced no clear resolution of the petition issue, and left opposition leaders divided on whether Mr. Chun's proposals were sincere or an attempt to put the opposition party on the defensive. **********Foreign diplomats said they did not know why Mr. Chun had suddenly decided to shift tactics, nor could they immediately evaluate the meeting today. Some South Koreans speculated that Mr. Chun's turnaround might have been influenced by recent events in the Philippines.

Opposition leaders vowed to continue the petition effort at the party's central committee meeting. **********At a briefing for foreign reporters today, a high-ranking presidential official would not directly address the petition drive issue. He said Mr. Chun had decided to ask the presidents of the opposition parties to lunch as a way to ''shift from confrontation to dialogue.'' **********But the official appeared to leave open the possibility that the Government might return to sterner measures in the future, and he seemed to reach out to moderates in the opposition party. ''Many opposition politicians with good sense do not want the continuation of confrontation,'' he said. ''If this is not the case, the situation can become tense again.'' **********Kim Dae Jung, a prominent Government critic whose 12 days of house arrest ended early today, expressed skepticism about the Government's motivations before the end of the lunch meeting.

''The shots made very big bangs - everybody heard them,'' said Vincenzo Natole, one of the island's 6,000 residents and, like many, a fisherman. ''But they fell far short of land and made a huge splash in the water.'' No Injuries or Damage **********The Libyan raid caused no deaths, no injuries and no damage, a local police official said tonight. **********Efforts to reach the target of the attack, a United States Coast Guard installation run by about 22 Americans, were unsuccessful. Residents were unable to drive reporters to the site because of a gasoline shortage. Storms had prevented delivery of fuel and other necessities that are shipped to the island almost daily on ferries. **********There was also no response to repeated telephone calls to the installation, whose 300-foot radar mast dominates the flat, barren island. **********But tonight the installation's blue searchlight flashed rhythmically as usual across the harbor. The Moby Dick Bar was crowded, and young boys played a spirited game of soccer near the main square - just about the only square - in the town of Lampedusa. **********Apart from the modern Coast Guard installation, the island is highly traditional enclave whose residents are sustained by fishing, some construction work and summer tourism. **********''I think most of us are afraid, but not so much of the Libyans,'' said Gian Giardina, a builder. ''We're afraid that the incident will keep the tourists away.'' Sun and Simplicity **********Each summer, hundreds of tourists are attracted to the island, 18 miles in circumference, for fishing, diving, sun and simplicity. Simple one- and two-story white houses with yellow and green shutters line the tree-shaded streets. **********The economy largely depends on the tourists, who camp, rent rooms in houses or stay in the few hotels. There is a daily flight between Palermo, Sicily, and Lampedusa's small airport. **********Islanders said they had never had trouble with Libya. Nor, they said, were relations strained with Tunisia, the closest North African neighbor, in whose waters the islanders fish. **********''It's the Italian police who fine us for fishing,'' one resident said. ''The Tunisians don't mind our little boats.'' **********But other residents said they were afraid of Libyan reprisals. ''This is a very small island,'' said Mr. Natole, the fisherman. ''One missile could totally destroy this place.'' **********Most of those interviewed said they got along well with the Americans at the Coast Guard installation. They said the Americans lived near the installation but often mingled with local residents in bars and restaurants. **********But some islanders, like Mr. Natole, were critical of the American raid on Libya. ''That guy, Qaddafi, sure, he is crazy,'' Mr. Natole said. ''But the Americans strike to teach the Libyans a lesson. Then 10 days later, the Libyans create more trouble for everybody.

At least 23 men and women were reported killed and several others were wounded, according to Indian news agencies tonight. **********It was the worst single attack by Sikh radicals in the troubled northern state in more than a year. The police were immediately put on alert in New Delhi and in parts of the Punjab and the neighboring Hindu-dominated state of Haryana to guard against retaliation by Hindus. **********Today's massacre was similar to an incident in July in which Sikh extremists also singled out Hindu passengers on a bus and killed 15 people. After that episode, anti-Sikh rioting spread through parts of the capital, and at least five people died in fighting and clashes with the police. An Escape on Motorcycles **********The attack today occurred early this evening in the rural Hoshiarpur district near the Pakistan border, and it appeared to have been carefully planned. The police said four armed men stopped the bus, ordered it driven to a remote area and then carried out the killings. **********When they finished, accomplices pulled up on motorcycles or scooters and the gunmen fled, the police said. **********The incident shocked Indian political leaders and citizens and awakened fears of new violence in a conflict that has led to thousands of killings in the last few years. **********Again, official news organizations tried to avoid stirring passions by identifying the victims only as members of ''a certain community.'' A Blow to Moderates **********It appeared that the attack was part of a continuing campaign by Sikh radicals to assassinate Hindus and drive them from the state of Punjab so that only Sikhs remain. The objective of the Sikh extremists is to transform the state into an independent nation to be called ''Khalistan,'' which means ''land of the pure.'' **********The attack was another blow to the political leadership of the moderate Sikhs who have been governing the Sikh-dominated state for more than a year in opposition to those calling for an independent nation. **********Surjit Singh Barnala, the Punjab Chief Minister and a moderate Sikh, condemned the killings as ''an act of criminal minds acting at the behest of foreign powers to disintegrate the nation.'' **********Mr. Barnala received another blow today in the form of a vote among Sikhs for the new president of the group that operates the Sikh temples in India. Mr. Barnala's candidate was defeated in the election by a man widely described as having the support of Sikh extremists. **********Sikhs are a religious sect formed more than 500 years ago as an offshoot of mysticism and monotheism from both Islam and Hinduism. The religion's political leadership is divided between radicals and moderates, with the radicals tending to view their acts of violence against Hindus as vengeance for the killing and jailing of Sikhs by the Government in recent years. Retaliation Is Feared **********The new attack was considered likely to renew the cycle of retaliation, drawing Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi further into the maelstrom on an issue that led to the assassination in 1984 of his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, by two Sikh security guards. **********Although the militant Sikh cause began as a drive for religious change and demands for an independent nation, many political analysts say it has now become a matter of vengeance among the fundamentalists who fear that their religion and way of life is being wiped out by Hindus. **********Religious or observant Sikhs wear turbans and beards and follow a practice of militant fundamentalism in which martyrdom and vengeance is a part of their religious creed. **********Prime Minister Gandhi achieved what was considered a breakthrough last year by reaching a political accommodation with moderate Sikhs, leading to their installation in power in Punjab state. The move did little to reconcile the radicals, however, who viewed the moderates as selling out to the Hindu-dominated Government in New Delhi. Attacks Nearly Every Day **********Since then, the moderate Sikh state government has been unable to cope with violence. Each day for the last several months seems to bring another new attack, with one or two or three people killed by what newspapers routinely characterize as Sikh ''terrorists,'' although in some cases the killings appear to have been committed by common criminals, like bank robbers, or in longstanding family or community feuds. **********Mr. Gandhi has been pressed to intervene, either by sending in the army or removing Mr. Barnala's government. This pressure was widely considered to have increased with the attack today. **********Mr. Gandhi's strategy has been to strengthen the police force in the Punjab by installing his own police director, Julius F. Rebeiro, who announced earlier this month that 57 Sikh ''terrorist'' suspects had been killed in the first 10 months of this year and that many more had been arrested."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/18/business/company-news-point-four-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Point Four Data", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Point Four Data", "body_text": " **********The Point Four Data Corporation said it had terminated its offer for up to 49.9 percent of Alpha Microsystems' shares at $6 each.

White House and Pentagon officials said the radar had been knocked out by Harm missiles, but renewed radar signals were detected during the night. **********''The damage in the first attack was replaced and started up again and was attacked again,'' said Mr. Sims, the Pentagon spokesman.

Gorbachev to reach a sweeping arms control agreement, several European officials say they are relieved that the talks did not result in accords that might have hurt the defense of Europe. **********''Reykjavik was broken off at the right time,'' said a senior adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany. ''It's time for stock-taking.'' **********At the center of West European concerns is the outline of a superpower accord that would eliminate medium-range nuclear weapons from Europe. That plan is, in effect, the ''zero solution'' proposal embraced as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's negotiating strategy in November 1981. Politics, Not Defense **********Many NATO experts concede that the plan's main attraction then was that it had wide appeal to Western European voters at a time of high anxiety about the threat of nuclear war. But in 1981, the plan appeared to have little chance of being accepted by the Soviet Union. **********The Iceland meeting came at a time of less anxiety in Europe. Mr. Kohl, for example, faces national elections in January, but the opposition Social Democrats, who fought the deployment of American medium-range missiles, are given little chance of ousting him. **********Now that Mr. Gorbachev has accepted in principle what was once the alliance's plan, its drawbacks from a Western view seem to have become more evident. **********Alliance members say it could hurt NATO's strategy of possibly responding with nuclear weapons to a conventional attack by the Warsaw Pact. NATO Generals Complain **********Last week, Gen. Hans-Joachim Mack, a West German who is Deputy Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, complained in Brussels to a group of British journalists that NATO was not properly briefed on the medium-range missile issue during the Reykjavik talks. **********General Mack also said his immediate superior, Gen. Bernard Rogers, an American, had angrily expressed misgivings to Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger about eliminating the medium-range missiles. **********At the same time, meeting in London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Francois Mitterrand clearly signaled their own concerns in a joint statement stressing the need to keep nuclear weapons at the center of NATO's strategy. **********And last Friday, speaking to France's National Assembly, Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond said France regarded the possibility of ''the total disappearance of American missiles from Europe'' as ''terrible.'' 'Other Factors' Emphasized **********''This would be inopportune for the Alliance and would reduce the security of Europe, particularly since one has to take into account other factors of disequilibrium, such as conventional and chemical weapons,'' said Mr. Raimond, referring to the Warsaw Pact's widely perceived superiority in those two areas. **********West Germany's concerns center on Soviet short-range nuclear arms. Those weapons would become more important strategically if both sides withdrew all medium-range missiles. From bases in East Germany and Czechoslovakia, the Soviet SS-21's, SS-22's, SS-23's and Scud-B's can cover most of the central front. **********The West Germans want any medium-range arms accord with the Soviet Union to include a commitment to negotiate on the short-range systems. In such talks NATO would seek the right to deploy some amount of similar short-range missiles. NATO has an older generation of Lance missiles but nothing to compare with the more modern Warsaw Pact short-range systems. French Worry: Long-Range Arms **********The French misgivings center on the tentative agreement in Reykjavik to work to slash both superpowers' strategic arsenals by 50 percent.

Shultz said further strategic reductions would have to include the nuclear arsenals of France and Britain, according to well-placed European sources. **********This upset the French because they have long insisted on several conditions before they would consider cuts in their forces, including sharp cuts in conventional forces. **********Beyond the issues, the almost visionary quality of the Reykjavik discussions unsettled many Western European arms experts, who said they were not sure Mr. Reagan was fully aware of what he was doing. **********''This is not serious,'' scoffed one senior French official, alluding to Mr. Reagan's proposal to abolish all ballistic missiles. ''My reflection on all of this is that you should not allow two men to negotiate on a Saturday night in a haunted house.'' **********Lawrence Freedman, an authority on nuclear strategy at the University of London, noted ''the enormous alarm in all NATO governments'' over some of the implications of the Iceland meeting. ''There is a lack of professionalism in the whole thing,'' he said of the Reagan approach to the summit. ''There's a frivolousness that is alarming.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/14/world/thousands-rally-for-marcos-in-manila.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1986-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 939, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THOUSANDS RALLY FOR MARCOS IN MANILA", "print_headline": "THOUSANDS RALLY FOR MARCOS IN MANILA", "body_text": " **********On the eve of a legislative challenge to Corazon C. Aquino, the supporters of Ferdinand E. Marcos held their biggest rally today since the deposed President fled the Philippines nearly seven weeks ago. **********Between 15,000 and 20,000 demonstrators, waving small paper flags and wearing badges and stickers that hailed Mr. Marcos, congregated in a park in downtown Manila. A smaller crowd of Marcos loyalists held a rally in the suburb of Quezon City. **********The rallies, which called for Mr. Marcos to return and Mrs. Aquino to step down, appeared to draw upon the organizational and financial resources of the ousted President's politicalparty, the New Society Movement, also known as the K.B.L. **********The party's legislators plan to convene a rump session of the National Assembly on Monday. Mrs. Aquino abolished the assembly by proclamation last month on the ground that its pro-Marcos majority had debased Philippine politics by endorsing fraudulent election returns in February to insure a Marcos victory. **********A Fraction of Aquino Crowd **********Rally organizers asserted that a million or more Filipinos turned out today to ask Mr. Marcos to come back. The police estimated the crowd at the park in Manila at about 20,000, although at times it seemed smaller. It was a fraction of the turnout of about one million that Mrs. Aquino drew at the park the week after she assumed the presidency. **********The demonstrations today seemed part of a strategy by Marcos loyalists to undermine Mrs. Aquino's claim to legitimacy. The rallies were preceded for several nights by smaller demonstrations outside a television station. **********''A crowd of 15,000 to 20,000 in Metro Manila is no laughing matter,'' said a pro-Aquino politician who saw part of the demonstration today. ''The danger is if these crowds escalate.'' **********Ninety-five legislators from Mr. Marcos's party have promised to take part on Monday in the unauthorized session of the National Assembly, which had as many as 200 members before it was dissolved. Legislators favoring Mrs. Aquino and her Vice President, Salvador H. Laurel, have refused to attend. **********Mr. Marcos's vice-presidental candidate, Arturo M. Tolentino, has said that the session is legal under the 1973 Constitution and that Mrs. Aquino had no right to abolish the assembly. Today he told the crowd in Manila that the Aquino Government was ''dictatorial.'' Bid to Nullify Appointments **********The agenda prepared for the session includes resolutions that will seek the nullification of Aquino appointments in all provinces and municipalities and guaranteed tenure for as many as one million civil servants and court officials from the Marcos regime. **********Blas F. Ople, a leading politician from the Marcos party, said Saturday that a failure to convene the session would be taken as an admission that the legislature had conspired to rob Mrs. Aquino of victory. **********Participants at the downtown rally today said that on Monday they would form a protective ring around the legislative session, which will be held at the Asian Institute of Tourism because the assembly building has been closed. **********''It's a morale booster,'' Parong Santos, a rally organizer, said of the rump session. ''It's something that we need at the moment to assert the inviolability of the people's will.'' The Marcos supporters call their movement ''the people's will,'' a deliberate echo of the ''people power'' slogan coined by Mrs. Aquino's followers. 'Marcos, We Need Him Here!' **********The demonstrations today evoked the frenzy of the political rallies held to extol Mr. Marcos when he held power. His supporters chanted ''Marcos, we need him here!'' and ''Down with Cory!'' to a cadence set by drummers. **********Many demonstrators, wearing T-shirts, jeans and rubber sandals, seemed to come from the urban poor that Mr. Marcos courted with sacks of rice and other largesse during the presidential campaign. **********''Our President is so kind to the poor,'' said Jesus Marmalao, a pro-Marcos demonstrator. ''I'm ready to die with him, no matter what happens.'' **********The supporters denied that they had been induced to come. ''We were not paid,'' said Xerxes Leyritana, a 26-year-old seaman who wore a red headband inscribed with the slogan ''people's will.'' **********Rusty Salazar, a director and movie actor who said he was a friend of the Marcoses, said he had been inside Malacanang Palace the night they fled. **********''We began organizing this immediately after Marcos left the country,'' he said. He did not say if the organizers had been in touch with Mr. Marcos. 'We Were Caught Unaware' **********When he was asked why Mr. Marcos's supporters had taken so long to reassert themselves, Mr. Salazar said: ''We were caught unaware. We never believed they had a chance to take over the Government.'' **********Oliver Lozano, a lawyer who described himself as head of the People's Crusade for the Supremacy of the Constitution, Rule of Law and Due Process, said his group would gather five million signatures before the end of next month and present them to the military, asking that it not block the inauguration of Mr. Tolentino as the new President. Mr. Marcos could return, retire and be an adviser, he said. **********Some demonstrators professed anger over what they called ''black propaganda'' about hidden Marcos wealth. ''It doesn't matter to us whether it is true or not,'' said one demonstrator, Annie Babst. ''What matters to us is he has to come back.'' **********One young man at the park in Manila was accused by several people of being a pro-Aquino infiltrator and was briefly roughed up.

But for the first time, the brokers will be entitled to a share of the income Merrill earns annually from such lines of business as Cash Management Accounts, second-mortgage loans and margin account loans. **********The new schedule, due to take effect next week, provides incentives for Merrill brokers to shift the emphasis of their business slightly away from selling stocks and bonds and more toward accumulating a customer's assets under the firm's management and expanding consumer credit relationships. **********In the process, Merrill will be dealing with a perennial problem: how to make a customer more loyal to the firm than to his broker. By linking the customer more to the firm's services it also makes its brokers less attractive to raiders from other firms. Assets Tied to Firm **********The new schedule ''in many respects places a handcuff on salesmen,'' said Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation. ''It ties a customer's assets to the firm rather than to the broker. And it retains the broker by paying him for asset accumulation at Merrill when he could not collect the same bonus elsewhere, even if he convinced all of his customers to move with him.'' **********For Merrill's retail customers, the changes mean ''the company takes on certain quasi-banking functions,'' said John D. Leonard, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. ''Merrill was way ahead of the league with its Cash Management Accounts. They now control more than half of all the assets in these accounts in the industry.'' **********Merrill's brokers already receive a commission for bringing in a Cash Management Account and now will be paid a fee annually based on the amount retained in that account. **********''This compensation plan places a new emphasis on consumer lending, with the loans very well secured by homes and by stocks and bonds,'' Mr. Leonard said. No Objections Heard **********The new pay formulas were outlined to Merrill's brokers yesterday afternoon following the close of the New York Stock Exchange. One New York broker, after hearing the explanation, said: ''It won't change the amount of money most of us make. If the company wants to go in that direction, we don't have any objection.'' **********Other major brokerage firms have amended their pay scales in the last two months, generally offering a higher percentage of commission charges to brokers who generate the most business and reducing compensation for those on the bottom. Also, Shearson Lehman Brothers introduced in December an asset-based bonus program that is similar to Merrill's but less rewarding to brokers. **********For stock and bond transactions, a Merrill broker typically receives 30 percent to 40 percent of the sales commission, depending on total sales for the year. The new schedule reduces a broker's share by about one percentage point, but gives bonuses for other kinds of financial services. Those other services include retaining customers' securities at Merrill rather than physically delivering them. That way, a customer is more likely to deal through Merrill on the sale of the securities, rather than going to a discount brokerage house or to another full service firm if his or her broker has left Merrill. **********The changes extend a strategy put into effect in 1978 to make Merrill more competitive against discount brokers and full-service financial institutions, while improving profit margins, according to James M. Flynn, a spokesman for Merrill. A Traditional Training Ground **********Merrill, long a training ground for young brokers, was also traditionally a raiding ground for other firms looking for experienced salespeople. Last year, the company reduced its turnover to 12 percent, nearly one-third lower than the industry average, according to Mr. Flynn. **********Mr. Long of Lipper Analytical Securities said that paying brokers for generating interest income was ''a smart way to redirect business into those areas that are most profitable.'' Other firms treat interest income as ''a house account,'' he said. **********Merrill's interest income has been substantially higher than its major competitors in recent years, according to Mr. Leonard. It has also been subtantially higher than income from commissions on securities transactions. **********Merrill has struggled to bring costs under control while improving revenues from new products and services. The company's earnings declined sharply from 1982 to 1984, recovering last year.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., N.Y. 202 pages, $18.95. LEE Iacocca's success at Chrysler after he was fired as president of the Ford Motor Company - not to mention his boasting about it in his best-selling autobiography - has helped remove some of the stigma of dismissal. But it has not eliminated the myths surrounding firings. **********Perhaps the biggest and most persistent myth is that executives are fired because of poor performance. In fact, notes the author of ''Sacked,'' that was the case in only 16 percent of the firings that he studied in his Executive Termination Study. That survey, which he did in collaboration with Thomas A. Byrnes, a partner in the management consulting firm of Byrnes Mirtz Morice Inc., forms the cornerstone of this book. It was conducted among senior executives in 73 corporations representing diverse industries. **********The survey, and thus the book, underscores the point that talented and capable people are fired even when they achieve good results. That means that anyone, regardless of ability, performance and years of dedication, can be at risk. Not surprisingly, employees are most at risk when working for a new boss, when they must in effect re-earn their stripes. **********While the usual reason given for the firing is that things just ''aren't working out,'' in most cases, the book says, the real reason involves one or more of the following: *********** Incompatible personalities that lead to antagonisms between subordinates and bosses. *********** Conflicts over strategy, specifically the direction in which the business should go and how to get there. *********** Philosophical differences over management style. *********** Disagreement over the subordinate's role within the corporation. **********While most firings catch terminated employees by surprise, the author, a vice president of human resources for a major corportion, writes that they are usually preceded by warning signals -everything from the boss starting to turn to other people to get things done, to other people in the organization becoming increasingly resistant to the ideas and actions of the endangered executive. **********Mr. Gould provides a checklist for identifying the possible areas of conflict or incompatibility with the boss, but he emphasizes that some situations may simply be irreconcilable. **********''If your basic nature is at the root of the differences,'' he writes, ''then you can't - and shouldn't -expect that you can become someone you're not for the sake of this job,'' he says. Thus, ''If your ideas, beliefs, style and personality are not compatible with the boss and/ or the organization, what do you have to gain - other than some egotistical notion of beating the rap and showing them a thing or two?'' While the author mentions the harmful psychological consequences of being fired, he spends too little time discussing the fact that firing is not always catastrophic. Indeed, many executives besides Mr. Iacocca have found being sacked a blessing in disguise, leading to greater challenges and opportunities. **********Over all, however, the book offers an interesting and valuable analysis of why so many management relationships end in separation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/06/business/eastern-pilots-said-to-be-seeking-another-buyer.html": {"writer_name": "John Crudele", "pub_date": "1986-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 672, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EASTERN PILOTS SAID TO BE SEEKING ANOTHER BUYER", "print_headline": "EASTERN PILOTS SAID TO BE SEEKING ANOTHER BUYER", "body_text": " **********Eastern Airlines' pilots are casting about for a carrier other than Texas Air to buy their troubled company, and in recent days their representatives have negotiated with Pan Am and Braniff, various sources close to the situation said yesterday. **********Eastern's pilots, as well as its flight attendants and machinists, from the start have opposed the takeover agreement announced last week that would make Eastern a subsidiary of Texas Air, the low-fare carrier that operates Continental Airlines. Lazard Freres Hired **********The Air Line Pilots Association opposed the deal so much that it directed Lazard Freres & Company, a Wall Street investment banking house, to fight the acquisition. **********Sources say Lazard has been in touch with other airlines in hopes of locating a buyer that the pilots might find more suitable than Texas Air, whose head, Frank Lorenzo, has been in a running feud with labor. **********Even if one of the unions were successful in coming up with another offer for Eastern, however, it would be difficult to break up the agreement between Eastern and Texas Air. **********The agreement contains provisions that would allow Texas Air to buy Eastern stock on the open market to raise its stake to 51 percent. Thus it could gain control even before formally merging. Texas Air has already made some large purchases of Eastern stock under the agreement. **********Eastern's board of directors, however, would have to consider other offers in the interest of stockholders. If a potential buyer could combine another offer with additional major concessions from the pilots' union or the machinists' union, the bidder would have considerable leverage with the board, which has the responsibility to consider ways to strengthen Eastern's financial position.

But they added that Pan Am's chairman, C. Edward Acker, soon began to cool on the idea. **********Pan Am confirmed that it had been approached about a deal with Eastern. ''Pan Am acknowledges that discussions were held,'' said Jeffrey Kriendler, vice president of corporate communications, who added that there was ''no current interest in pursuing the matter.'' **********Sources close to the situation said it was likely that Mr. Acker would soon tell Lazard that he would not support a merger of his airline with Eastern. If that happens, the sources said it was likely that Braniff would also bow out. Braniff was bailed out of bankruptcy in the early 1980's by an investor group in which Jay Pritzker had a sizable stake. The group streamlined Braniff and revived it through discounted fares. **********But it is also widely believed, the sources said, that Lazard would continue its quest to determine if someone else is interested in Eastern. The sources cautioned that talks with all parties were too preliminary to predict the outcome. Exploring 'All Possibilities' **********John Mazor, a spokesman for the pilots' union, said Lazard had been hired by the Eastern Airlines segment of the union to ''explore all possibilities'' such as an employee buyout and leveraged buyout. Mr. Mazor said that Lazard was still active in ''getting ideas'' from the pilots. **********John Peterpaul, head of the aviation and transportation division of the International Association of Machinists, said several airlines had made inquiries about Eastern. He declined to name them. **********If Lazard succeeds in finding a bidder, it could create a situation as complicated as the one Trans World Airlines found itself in last year when it tried to merge with Texas Air.

Muammar el-Qaddafi is still badly shaken, but apparently in control, according to diplomats and other sources here. **********The shattering impact of the raid, however, coupled with growing shortages of food and other mounting economic problems, have put Colonel Qaddafi in the most difficult position since his band of young army officers, inspired by Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, seized power 17 years ago, the sources said. **********''There is a lot of discontent and a lot of fear,'' said a diplomat from a third-world country. ''But he is still in charge through his revolutionary guards and his close associates within the regime.'' **********Colonel Qaddafi has rarely been seen in public since the raid, diplomats here said, and he is believed to be spending much of his time at Sebha, a desert oasis where, in times of stress, he has often returned to his Bedouin roots. Failure to Appear for Speech **********In the latest example of the colonel's often erratic behavior, on Wednesday he failed to make what had been promised as a major speech at a rally celebrating the anniversary of the departure in 1970 of American personnel from Wheelus Air Base. The anniversary is a major holiday in Libya's revolutionary calendar. **********More than 30 Western journalists, including representatives of the major American newspapers, weekly magazines, television networks and news agencies, had been invited here by the Government to cover the appearance. **********Instead, the Colonel made a rambling, disjointed speech on television that lasted 1 hour 50 minutes. His usually craggy face was swollen, and there were dark bags under his eyes. **********The speech appeared to have generated little interest or enthusiasm among the people. As it was broadcast over loudspeakers from public buldings, a crowd of fewer than 2,000 that gathered seemed bored and listless. A few blocks away people fished or swam from the shore, and groups of youths played soccer. Distance From People Grows **********''The gap between the people and the leader is growing bigger and bigger, and the speech shows that,'' a Western diplomat said the next day. **********Government officials, who offered no explanation for the change in plans for the speech, told the journalists they must leave the country as soon as possible. Indeed, they were so eager to have the journalists leave that on Friday they drove a busload to an Alitalia flight that had already been canceled as part of a cutback in scheduled flights. The journalists left on a later flight. **********''Next time I hope things will be better,'' a ministry official said. **********In the streets of the capital these days, lines of people clutching plastic bags form when stores get a delivery of flour. Many shops are shuttered because they have no goods to sell, and there are empty shelves in those stores that are open. **********Arabs traditionally buy gifts and new clothes at the end of the month of daily fasting known as Ramadan. But this year, when the period ended a week ago, there was little to buy. Recently, sources here said, an angry crowd broke a window in a shoe store when supplies ran out. 'A Lot of Grumbles' **********''The economy is in a bad way,'' a Western diplomat said. ''There have been a lot of grumbles. The shortages are acute, not to say chronic. There are empty shelves in all the supermarkets, and it's been that way for a very long time.'' **********In addition to the shortages, many Libyans, after years of bellicose rhetoric and huge spending for arms, were surprised when there was no effective resistance to the United States raid. **********''People were very badly shaken, greatly frightened,'' the diplomat said. ''There was a mass exodus from Tripoli. On the government level, Qaddafi seems to have been shocked, and the shock lasted some time.'' **********But diplomats here said they saw little immediate prospect that Colonel Qaddafi would be overthrown, as the United States apparenly hoped when it staged the raid. **********''He has a very good security service, very efficient,'' a European diplomat said. ''And he has these young boys of the revolutionary committees in the barracks. They are very powerful; they control the ammunition and can arrest even a colonel. It is enough.'' Posters After the Raid **********''You cannot change the political situation overnight,'' he added. ''It is naive to expect on the Americans' part that all of a sudden the army and the opposition are going to make a coup.'' **********Tripoli is still festooned with pictures of Colonel Qaddafi and revolutionary slogans. In the wake of the raid more posters have been put up. Many show rockets hitting American planes. One plywood ceremonial arch shows an American airman descending by parachute as Libyan women wait on the ground to beat him with brooms. **********But the odd translations and misspellings - ''Reagan is an unkept barbarian,'' says one - lend a lunatic quality. **********The customs booths at the airport, for example, are topped with elaborate illuminated glass signs bearing carefully lettered sayings, in green, from Colonel Qaddafi's political manifesto, ''The Green Book.'' **********One quotation says in its entirety, ''No representation in lieu of the people and presentation is frud.'' A Bizarre Speech **********Even by the standard set by Colonel Qaddafi, much of the speech he gave Wednesday seemed bizarre. ''American soldiers must be turned into lambs and eating them is tolerated,'' he said at one point, according to the text issued the next day by Jana, the official press agency. **********''A search is under way in all the documents on Reagan's past in the Gestapo,'' he added. **********Although Libya is now almost entirely dependent on imported food and manufactured goods, Colonel Qaddafi said: ''From now on, any Libyan who wears clothes manufactured in Japan or Europe, I shall consider him wearing the death clothes of the martyrs of our people. Whoever eats European food, he is eating a forbidden food.'' **********Although Colonel Qaddafi threatened in his speech that he would join the Soviet bloc, there was an indication that Moscow may be distancing itself. A Soviet delegation had reserved two floors in the El Khabir hotel for the ceremony, but failed to show up. **********Nevertheless, Colonel Qaddafi said, ''We are capable of destroying America and breaking its nose.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/08/business/deficit-paring-setback-is-expected-to-be-slight.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1986-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 843, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEFICIT-PARING SETBACK IS EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHT", "print_headline": "DEFICIT-PARING SETBACK IS EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHT", "body_text": " **********The Supreme Court's rejection of a central feature of the balanced-budget law could slow efforts to reduce Federal budget deficits, members of Congress and the financial world said today. **********But they doubt that the war has been lost against the deficits that have dogged the economy since the start of the Reagan Administration, they said, adding that deficits are still likely to begin falling - next year if not this. **********Moreover, the financial markets, once the harshest real-world judge of deficit spending, appear to assume that the deficits are still heading down, regardless of the Court's ruling. **********The stock market plunged today, but analysts blamed factors other than the Court's decision. And they noted that the credit markets, which would be the first to reflect a fear of widening deficits because they would tend to push up interest rates, were not much affected. **********''The deficits are still the No. 1 concern in the future of the economy,'' said John F. McGillicuddy, chairman of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, ''but it's recognized by the marketplace that we are addressing the question.'' **********''Wall Street might not read the decision properly, but I don't think it is much concerned about deficit reduction any more,'' said Gary Wenglowski, chief economist at the Wall Street firm of Goldman, Sachs & Company. Main Mechanism Rejected **********By a decision of 7 to 2, the Supreme Court rejected the principal enforcement mechanism of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law that Congress enacted last December. The provision authorizes the General Accounting Office, an institution created by Congress, to order the President and Congress to make major cuts across much of the budget to meet the ever-lower annual deficit goals that the law stipulates if Congress and the President fall short. The Court found that the provision violated the Constitution's separation-of-powers doctrine. **********Congress is divided over its response to the decision. Some leaders said they were confident that another, constitutionally acceptable way would be found to achieve the same results as the Gramm-Rudman law, such as a law denying Congress the right to remove the head of the G.A.O. (currently Charles Bowsher) and that it would be enacted before December. **********''Take out the removal clause -that's what I think we'll do,'' said Senator Lawton Chiles, Democrat of Florida and the ranking minority member of the Senate Budget Committee. Because 1986 is a Congressional election year, he said he thought some members wanted to abandon the Gramm-Rudman law because of the sharp cuts in domestic spending it might require. But the public appeal of deficit reduction is such now, he said, that ''I don't think they'll find room to do that.'' Details of Chiles Proposal **********The change in the law that Senator Chiles envisions, he said, would assure that the budget deficits would decline in the magnitudes that the Gramm-Rudman law requires - from the record $212 billion of the fiscal year 1985, which ended last Sept. 30, to $144 billion in the fiscal year 1987 and to zero by the fiscal year 1991 in $36 billion annual cuts. **********But prospects that Congress will actually commit itself to cuts of such a size and to figures of such precision appear to have dimmed, economists and other members of Congress said. In addition to the Court decision, they said that the nation's economy, which has proved softer this year than Congress and the Administration expected, makes meeting the Gramm-Rudman schedule all but impossible. **********Representative Charles Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat and a member of the House Budget Committee, said he thought such mechanical deficit slashing now looks improbable. He said: **********''The train is still on the track, but we're not on automatic. Congress is the conductor again. And in Congress there's some two-facedness. Yes, you want to reduce the deficits. No, you don't want to make the individual cuts to reduce them. It's going to be extremely difficult to get down to that 144.'' Change in Earlier Outlook **********At the start of this year, Government economists expected stronger growth to produce higher tax revenues and thus a measurably smaller deficit, of about $200 billion, and one of about $180 billion next year. **********But economists say now that slower growth could mean a deficit of close to last year's $212 billion. For this year, Mr. Wenglowski of Goldman, Sachs expects a deficit of $215 billion. And in view of both the Court's ruling and this year's sluggish economy, he sees a deficit of $190 billion next year. **********Such figures far exceed the Gramm-Rudman targets, but economists said they still point downward and that in relation to a growing economy, they are already proportionately smaller than last year's. **********''If Gramm-Rudman remains morally and politically binding, and I think it will, I don't see why this decision should change things much,'' said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist at the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. ''The issue isn't 144. It's whether you're moving into a reasonable range.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/24/business/technology-tripping-up-enemy-radar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 810, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Technology; Tripping Up Enemy Radar", "print_headline": "Technology; Tripping Up Enemy Radar", "body_text": " **********IN World War II, the German military, concerned that its U-boats' jutting snorkels might be vulnerable to detection by Allied radar, applied a radar-absorbent coating to the snorkels to make the U-boats far more difficult to detect. **********In the last few years, such technology has enjoyed major advances, promising to make planes and missiles much harder to see on enemy radar. The Northrop Corporation is using such technology, which has come to be known as Stealth, in a bomber, drones and a tactical cruise missile. The Lockheed Corporation is using it in a fighter plane, and General Dynamics is adopting it for a cruise missile. **********But while the technology of hiding planes and missiles has advanced dramatically, so has radar become far more sensitive and sophisticated, leading to a classic race between competing technologies. **********Stealth planes or missiles are not quite the aeronautical sequels to H.G. Wells's ''The Invisible Man.'' A Stealth missile or aircraft is as obvious to the eye as any other plane or missile. But on enemy radar, while not invisible, they are much harder to detect than conventional objects. **********Visibility on radar is measured by the radar cross section, or RCS. Because some shapes and substances reflect radar signals much better than others, the RCS can be either much bigger or much smaller than the cross section of the object's true size. The smaller the RCS the better the Stealth. For example, a B-52 bomber has an RCS of about 100 square meters, while the more recent B-1A bomber had an RCS of only around 10 square meters. This reportedly was trimmed in the B-1B to just one square meter. The word in the industry is that Lockheed's top-secret Stealth fighter has an RCS of just one-tenth of a square meter. **********Stealth is accomplished by advances in two fields: design and materials. These are coupled with electronic systems that catch the attention of enemy radar but confound it. The plane is shaped in such a way as to reflect as few radar signals as possible, and it is made of materials that absorb or deflect radar signals rather than reflecting them back to the radar operator. **********Because radar pulses are accentuated by sharp angles, particularly concave angles, airframes are designed to be as rounded as possible, with nothing sticking out. When the original B-1 bomber was redesigned to make it more Stealthy, for example, the engines were tucked inside the airframe and a crest on the fuselage was removed. **********''The more you make something into a smooth blob, the better off you are from a radar point of view,'' said R. John Hansman, the Edgerton assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For this reason, the Stealth bomber is likely to look like a flying wing, without fuselage or tail. **********Such a flying wing would still be vulnerable, however, if it were not made of a carbon and epoxy composite. Such composites, which consist of tiny filaments one-tenth the diameter of a human hair, absorb radar. These composites are also lighter than aluminum. **********''There's no reason why you can't make the structure of a plane all out of composites,'' said Paul A. Lagace, co-director of the Technology Laboratory for Advanced Composites at M.I.T. ''It would be more efficient to make the landing gear out of steel, but there's no reason why it couldn't be made out of composites.'' **********Inside the plane, however, it might be necessary to include some metal: in wires, instruments and accessories. These could still reflect radar but more faintly than if they were on the outside. **********Mitigating to some extent these advances in Stealth is progress in radar detection. Although the Stealth bomber will appear as a narrow sliver when viewed from the front, for example, it will be a broad platform when viewed from above or below. Thus it could be vulnerable to detection by satelite-based radar systems or high-flying planes with sophisticated radar. At the same time, in the last decade radars have grown more powerful and have sophisticated computers that analyze the images. Today a modern radar can detect an object with an RCS of one square meter at 230 miles or more, according to an industry source. **********Further increases in radar sensitivity seem likely, because the barrier is not technological so much as the availability of a large power supply and other practical obstacles. **********''If you had an unlimited power supply - if you could use the Hoover Dam to power your radar -theoretically there's no limit to what you can detect,'' the source said. That will increase the challenge for Stealth technology, although experts say that Stealth planes will still have the edge over conventional weapons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/business/india-seeks-carbide-order.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "India Seeks Carbide Order", "print_headline": "India Seeks Carbide Order", "body_text": " **********The Indian Government today asked an Indian court to bar the Union Carbide Corporation from destroying evidence relating to the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster. **********The Government made the request in a district court where it filed suit last month for compensation of victims in the disaster and for punitive damages against Union Carbide.

It says that Mr. Agca had willfully destroyed his own credibility as a witness, seemed intent on protecting his accomplicies and might have had reason to expect that he would be helped to escape from prison if he succeeded in sabotaging the prosecution. **********The 1,200-page document is a justification of sentence that Italian judges are required to file. **********In reviewing Mr. Agca's activities before the shooting, the document contends that there was a direct connection between his escape from a Turkish prison in 1979 and his public threats to kill the Pope during a papal visit to Turkey the same year. **********Noting Mr. Agca's ties to Turkish criminal groups and political extremists, the document concludes that there is some credibility to ''the hypothesis'' that the suspected Turkish assassins were ''commissioned'' by ''another group'' that wanted to ''disguise the political'' motivation of the act. **********The document said the trial left no doubt that Mr. Agca had received help from the Turkish underworld and it noted Mr. Agca's contentions of ties between Turkish criminal groups and the Bulgarian secret service. **********After recalling the sanctuary Mr. Agca received in Bulgaria in 1980, the judge said that Bulgaria had refused to cooperate fully in the investigation. Alibi Called Fabricated **********The alibis provided by the three Bulgarian defendants were judged weak and suspicious in the document. Two of the Bulgarians, former embassy officials, were not present for the trial. The third, Sergei L. Antonov, former station manager of the Balkan Airlines office here, provided an alibi that was ''suspect because it was patently fabricated,'' the document said. **********Mr. Agca's contention that he had met Mr. Antonov on several occasions was held credible because of the detailed information Mr. Agca provided about Mr. Antonov's appearance and habits. The report said supicions of a link between Mr. Agca and the Bulgarians persisted because Mr. Agca had testified accurately about a Bulgarian diplomatic truck that left Rome hours after the shooting and that he said was to be his getaway vehicle. **********The document also rebutted allegations that agents of the Italian secret service had coached Mr. Agca to implicate the Bulgarians. **********Despite many indications of a conspiracy, the dcoument said, ''the evaluation of the evidence required extreme caution'' because of the courtroom behavior of the principal prosecution witness, Mr. Agca, who offered ''retractions and denials of the retractions themselves on fundamental points of the investigation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/04/business/finance-new-issues-fannie-mae-offer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fannie Mae Offer", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Fannie Mae Offer", "body_text": " **********The Federal National Mortgage Association is offering $900 million of 7 percent debentures due 1991 at a price of par through various securities dealers.

One of those characteristics is limited liability - an individual who conducts his own business through an S corporation -which was formerly known as a subchapter S corporation -cannot be held personally liable for more than the amount invested in the business. **********Frank X. Iaquinto, a partner at the Philadelphia office of Laventhol & Horwath, another large accounting firm, said another strength of the S corporation is that it pays no corporate tax - all income ''flows through to the shareholders.'' **********This enables shareholders in an S corporation to avoid the double taxation of typical corporations - the corporation pays income tax and the shareholders are taxed on dividends. **********The impact can be dramatic. If an S corporation earned $10 million in 1985, all of those earnings would be passed on to shareholders. A shareholder in the 50 percent bracket would pay a total of 50 percent tax on those earnings, and the after-tax earnings would be $5 million. In a regular corporation earning $10 million, the earnings would first be subject to the corporate income tax of 46 percent, leaving 54 percent, or $5.4 million, available for distribution to shareholders. **********If those earnings were distributed as capital gains, the shareholders would pay about 20 percent tax on that $5.4 million, according to a study by KMG Main Hurdman, the accounting firm. The double taxation would be about 57 percent, and about $4.3 million of the $10 million would be available as after-tax income. **********If the $5.4 million were distributed as dividends to individual shareholders taxed at 50 percent, the double taxation would be 73 percent, and the after-tax income only 27 percent, or $2.7 million, according to KMG Main Hurdman. **********Investors should note, however, that S corporations are not permitted to shelter from taxes 85 percent of dividends received from holdings in other companies, as regular corporations are. Thus, the S corporation cannot be set up as a personal holding company for one's investments. **********''S corporations can also eliminate various tax traps,'' Mr. Iaquinto said. ''In Pennsylvania and Illinois, S corporations pay lower state taxes.'' **********The Cogeneration Development Corporation, which has headquarters in New York, was established as an S corporation in 1980 by Thomas R. Casten and Michael Weiser, who bought a unit of the Cummins Engine Company that specialized in producing heat and electrical power simultaneously. ''We thought it would have useful tax consequences because income is passed through,'' said Mr. Casten, who added he also liked the elimination of double taxation. **********The regulations that authorize S corporations also impose restrictions on them. S corporations can have no more than 35 shareholders. Other corporations, partnerships, nonresident aliens and most trusts are barred from holding shares. In addition, S corporations cannot issue preferred shares and cannot have a subsidiary that owns 80 percent or more of any other company. **********Mr. Iaquinto of Laventhol & Horwath recommended the S corporation for closely held family businesses, because it is easy for the owners to withdraw cash readily. **********Shareholders of a company in high tax brackets will tend to benefit more from an S corporation, accountants say, because losses, like profits, flow through to the shareholders. An individual's losses are limited to the amount invested in the corporation, plus any indebtedness owed the investor by the corporation. **********S corporations are permitted to operate on a fiscal year basis. But shareholders must report on their individual returns all income from the fiscal year for the year in which the fiscal year ended. Thus, a shareholder in an S corporation that used a fiscal year ending July 31 would report on the 1985 returns all income - or losses - from that fiscal year, which would include the last five months of 1984 and the first seven of 1985."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/28/business/boeing-posts-51.6-rise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 409, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOEING POSTS 51.6% RISE", "print_headline": "BOEING POSTS 51.6% RISE", "body_text": " **********Spurred by increased commercial and military sales, the Boeing Company today reported sharp gains in revenues and net earnings for the fourth quarter of 1985 and for the full year. **********Boeing reported fourth-quarter earnings of $188 million, or $1.21 a share, up 51.6 percent from $124 million, or 84 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier.

All are relishing that rarest board room perk, the Queen's honors, which money is not supposed to be able to buy. **********This year's summer list is providing the usual semiannual stirring of the British social pot, six months after the traditional New Year's list. Although only a few have been elevated to knighthoods, dozens of favored business entrepreneurs have been publicly honored. **********''I don't even get a sword,'' said the newest Sir John, John Egan, chief executive of Jaguar P.L.C., the luxury car maker. He was jesting at ingratitude, taking the honor as a mark of his company's successful reversal of fortunes in the past five years under his direction. **********''There aren't many successful car companies left here,'' he said, suggesting one reason why he might have been singled out. ''I don't think there's any immediate or practical benefit to knighthood, but it does confer that air of respectability to you and your endeavors.'' **********And, a place in history, too. The creation of peers and knights - lords and sirs - is almost as ancient as the monarchy, while a third category, the British Empire awards, was founded in 1917 to recognize distinguished civilian service in World War I. It was soon broadened to pay tribute to Britons of varied fields. **********More than a thousand honors are announced each year for individuals in all sorts of fields, from civil service to show business. They are an act of gratitude that costs the Government not a shilling beyond the price of a press release and investiture ceremonies with Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace. **********The awards to business executives are considered especially significant under the Conservative Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Although all the appointments are made in the name of the Queen, they are managed by the Prime Minister's office and clearly reflect the thinking of the ruling party. In the case of Mrs. Thatcher, a fierce proponent of tough-minded free enterprise, they allow her to underline just the sort of business toughness she wants in the land. **********The newest swatch of honors, for example, includes a knighthood for Ian MacGregor, the hard-nosed executive with dual citizenship who three years ago left Lazard Freres & Company in New York to serve as chairman of the National Coal Board. He served through a difficult period, closing uneconomical mines and taking a yearlong miners' strike in a campaign rated highly successful by the Prime Minister. IN the executive appointments, nuances are discerned easily enough by the business world. Thus, the newest list's inclusion of a knighthood for Stanley Grinstead, chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, the big food, beverage and hotel company, is taken as a Thatcher endorsement of the privatization of government services. Grand Metropolitan provides private catering services at some government hospitals. **********Mrs. Thatcher's Laborite critics contend that her patronage system is considerably influenced by an anti-labor predilection and by the power of party contributions from the sort of business leaders that are dubbed Fat Cats in the United States. But the Prime Minister's office insists merit is the only applicable standard, even if the precise method for seeking and winning an honor is kept vague and not written down anywhere. **********''There probably isn't any one person in the land who can tell you how the honors system works,'' the Prime Minister's deputy press secretary, James Coe, explains without apology. ''It's shrouded in secrecy, the way all governments have kept it, because once the system is written down all sorts of people would try to use it to their advantage.'' **********Even so, people close to the Government clearly know how the system works and some of them sound like drug dealers as they talk of the private ''bidding for K's'' - lobbying for knighthoods. **********Clearly, inclusion on the honor's list is a plum for executives. ''No matter what you may hear, the honors are considered incredibly important among business leaders,'' says Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director for Burke's Peerage, a publishing and research business that tracks the social register of Britain. ''They provide that extra bit of entree to certain board directorships, and a social entree, too.'' **********He stoutly defends the system as democratic, a means of opening society to newly successful individuals. ''It's actually the least snobby of all,'' he said. ''It's a society that takes to its bosom diverse groups of people. Where else do you see an immensely rich grocer so well accepted by society?'' he asked, referring to Lord Sainsbury, a supermarket czar. THE top ranks of old American society, from Cabots to Roosevelts and beyond, are static by comparison to Britain's in quickly assimilating new generations, Mr. Brooks-Baker maintains. **********''If more countries had this kind of system, they'd have something very constructive for society and save a great deal of money in the process,'' he said. ''In other places, extending an honor or title usually means a desk, salary and office. Not here.'' **********He estimates that perhaps one-third of the 1,200 or so names on the honors lists each year might come from the business world, and in the past they have included such luminaries as Sir Freddy Laker, the no-frills airline pioneer, and Sir James Goldsmith, the financier-turned-takeover artist. But there are no firm figures available on how many thousands of business leaders now enjoy Queen's honors. **********There seems little doubt that, if only for the sheer bulk of honors slots available, whatever party is incumbent shows its philosophical biases. When the Labor Government was in power, for example, union leaders were among those singled out. **********And, in a period of swashbuckling corporate takeovers, it was no surprise that one of the most dynamic acquisition masters singled out last year should also be the undeniable Tory loyalist, James Hanson. He is Lord Hanson now, head of Hanson Trust, the big industrial group. His partner, who runs his American affiliate, Hanson Industries, was earlier honored and named Sir Gordon White. **********The basic difference in status between the two is that while Sir Gordon may use the title for his lifetime, Lord Hanson has the additional lifetime honor of being able to attend - and to cast votes in - the House of Lords. **********Many of the 1,700 peers occasionally do, depending on the issue and their schedules. But many do not bother, just as any number of individuals choose each year not to accept a title when they are discreetly sounded out. One of the other advantages of being a lord is that lords are exempt from jury duty and may not be arrested in the course of a civil action. **********Knights - of which there are several thousand - are not entitled to sit in the House of Lords and receive no privileges other than the accolade, Sir. Below them in the rankings are Empire awardees - the list of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, where individuals are designated as commanders, officers or members. Those honored may use the coveted initials of honor -C.B.E., O.B.E. or M.B.E., respectively - after one's name. **********Beyond the nomenclature, those honored in all categories are invited to meet Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace. The investitute ceremonies, which are held for separate groups of people honored, are scattered throughout the social calendar. **********For a businessman, the advantage of honors seems clearest in the instant compounding of whatever prestige has been acquired in the board room. One of the best-known men in England, Arnold Weinstock, chief executive of the General Electric Company Ltd., was a self-confident success at business with memorable takeovers in the 1960's and a happy traveler in society's arts and horse racing avocations. But, with his appointment to the Queen's list, he became even better known in the public prints as Sir Arnold Weinstock in 1970, then Lord Weinstock in 1980. **********There are Britons who sniff at the system. Prime Minister Robert Peel 150 years ago summarized the argument against honors when, in noting the endless annual batches of people made as freshly and similarly special as so many hot cookies, he asked why, instead, ''people do not begin to feel the distinction of an unadorned name.'' The anarchist, poet and critic Herbert Read presented perhaps the ultimate rationalization for his accepting an honor in saying he was not ''important enough'' to turn it down. **********One way to measure the royal gilding of the business class is to check the list of England's 100 highest-paid executives. It now includes 28 Lords or Sirs, plus a comparable portion of British Empire honors. **********''I'm told it's easier to get a table in a crowded restaurant,'' said Sir Nigel Mobbs, chief executive of Slough Estates Ltd. and one of the new knights, making the standard joke about the value of his new title. **********His particular merit for honors, aside from general Tory loyalty and a history in the industrial real estate field, was his service at the head of a study panel that advised the Prime Minister's office how to better manage the Government's property holdings. Such quid pro quo is hardly frowned upon. **********There seems to be noticeably little joking about the honor among peers and their friends, according to Sir Nigel. It is a serious enough matter, he says, that there is little commercial abuse of it by means of product advertizing and the like. ''It's a rarity for it to be exploited,'' he said. ''Although I'm sure it has not been disadvantageous to some people in their business endeavors.'' **********In a sense, the system began at the basic lucre level of social power 1,000 years ago when the possession of land implied wealth and command of manpower. The early land barons were the first peers, summoned by the king to join the Grand Council of the realm's most important people. Society and its honors have grown more eclectic since then - the rock music and anti-famine impresario Bob Geldof is on the summer list - but the command of wealth and manpower remains a reliable denominator. ONE knowledgeable but partisan observer of the honors system, Lord Donoughue, contends that the Conservatives' use of honors to reward corporate contributors to party campaigns is reprehensible. As a veteran of past Labor governments with an inside understanding of how the lists are shaped, he concedes that his party had its own favorites, more likely union leaders. But he feels the Conservatives unfairly tap company profits to be used for campaign purposes, which do not hurt their chances for Queen's honors. **********According to John Walker, another Laborite who analyzes the honors lists, the first five years of awards under the Thatcher government show that all 11 private-sector industrialists who received peerages and 44 of the 64 knights from the private sector were from companies identified as significant Tory contributors. He concedes that the latest list shows less of a patronage-contribution tie, but says that the Tory record generally shows that a business executive roughly doubled his chances for a peerage or knighthood if his company contributed to Mrs. Thatcher's party. **********Conservatives reply that such readings are distorted and dictated more by envy of the party's success in office. They also say that a special government panel, the honors scrutiny committee, guards against abuses of patronage considerations. **********There may be no pound-sterling value on the Queen's honors, but their potential as currency was clear for a sensational instant last winter during the controversy over the Westland helicopter company. At one point, Prime Minister Thatcher made a rare personal venture into the fray, sharply and quickly protecting the integrity of the Queen's honors by denying a charge by Alan Bristow, a Westland stockholder, that he had been offered a knighthood by officials if he would cease stirring the issue. Nothing has since come of the charge, but it flared in the public's mind as an alleged bribe of regal dimensions. **********Abuse of the honors system is as historic as everything else in Britain. Although the system of honors was more than 800 years old at the time, King James I in the early 17th century more than doubled the initial price for a knighthood, which had been $:40, and the price of a peerage was $:10,000. Interest in this commerce was inviting enough, according to historians, for the king to permit the sale of something new, baronetcies, for $:1,000 each. The money was said to be needed to finance the subjugation of Ireland. **********A later period of scandal occurred in the early 20th century when Lloyd George was Prime Minister and one of his trusted aides, Maundy Gregory, became the only man ever convicted of touting honors. EVER since, modern honors list-building has seemed tame, even honorable, with little controversy over many of the choices, particularly when philanthropy and charity are factors. **********The awarding this month of an honorary knighthood to John Paul Getty 2d, the Anglophile American and industrial heir who lives part of the year in London and has given a small fortune to British causes in the arts, sports and philanthropies, was praised by Conservative and Laborite alike. Mr. Geldof, the rock-star businessman, received his knighthood -also honorary since he is Irish - a year late, in the view of some Britons who felt his Ethiopian aid concert was one of the feats of 1985 and deserved a royal accolade then. Periodically, the Queen presents honorary awards to people who are not British. **********The awarding of honors has shifted a bit in recent years. The Peerage Act of 1958 encouraged the creation of more limited lifetime peerages and the shift, gradually, away from the hereditary system without doing away with it entirely. Today, a modern lord - or lady - is more likely to earn the title rather than to acquire it through blood lines. **********Advocates say this encourages a competitiveness and enthusiasm - a kind of self-made nobility - of the rags-to-riches sort exemplified by Victor Matthews. Now Lord Matthews, he began his business life as an office boy and went on to create a huge conglomerate, Trafalgar House, with businesses that range from Cunard Line to the Ritz Hotel here. He made himself a press baron nine years ago with the acquisition of the Beaverbrook Newspapers. **********But it took the Queen to make him a real baron in 1980, with an azure-and-gold coat of arms that J.R. Ewing could envy and a crest depicting a horse upraised against a Corinthian column of white marble. Such crests and coats of arms - for lords only -are designated by the Queen and are drawn from a historical, but long-unused heraldic collection. **********New peers say they do not dwell on such trappings. Sir John of Jaguar says he will continue to answer his phone with a quiet ''John Egan.'' But for him and other true believers in England, such as Sir Ralph Halpern, the business knight who thanked his realm of workers, the honor forces a basic change in identity. **********''For 41 years I've been 'Mr.' and now 'Mr.' is gone, and I'm going to miss it very much,'' said Sir Ralph in a kind of happy mourning."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/25/world/physicist-sees-major-changes-for-soviet.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1986-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 477, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PHYSICIST SEES MAJOR CHANGES FOR SOVIET", "print_headline": "PHYSICIST SEES MAJOR CHANGES FOR SOVIET", "body_text": " **********Andrei D.

Brown said the study, titled ''1986 U.S. Industrial Outlook,'' indicated that ''1986 should be a good year, by and large better than 1985.'' **********Although forecasting gains in manufacturing industries, Mr. Brown said the nation's burgeoning service industries, such as banking and insurance, would do ''even better'' this year. **********Winners and Losers **********In its annual prediction of winners and losers, issued late Tuesday, the department also said companies manufacturing turbine generators would suffer a 30.7 percent drop in shipments in the new year. **********But in a prediction that seemed somewhat more optimistic than other projections, the report said the semiconductor industry should have the fastest growth in 1986, with a projected 28 percent gain in shipments. But that growth comes after the industry's worst downturn in a decade, and would still put semiconductor shipments far below the levels projected for 1986 two years ago. **********For manufacturing as a whole, the growth in shipments should average 2.2 percent, compared with a 2 percent gain in 1985, according to the Commerce Department. It would mark the fourth consecutive year that shipments of manufactured goods have increased, with the biggest rise a 5.3 percent gain recorded in 1984. **********Shipments of manufactured goods last declined in the recession year of 1982, when they fell 4.5 percent. **********Mr. Brown forecast that assets in mutual funds would grow by 36.5 percent this year, the largest increase of any single service industry, followed by an expected 12 percent gain in revenues by businesses offering legal services. Growth in Service Sector **********The growing importance of the service sector to the United States economy can be seen from the fact that of the 2.9 million jobs added to the labor force in the past year, 82 percent were in the service area, Mr. Brown said. **********He said service industries now accounted for 68 percent of the gross national product and 74 percent of total employment. **********According to the Commerce Department report, the fastest-growing manufacturing industries in 1986 after semiconductors should be computer equipment, with 23.2 percent growth; railroad equipment, 19.4 percent; primary aluminum, 12.7 percent; optical devices, 11 percent; telephone equipment, 10 percent; X-ray equipment, 9.9 percent; industrial furnaces, 9.4 percent; printing machinery, 9.3 percent, and cookies and crackers, 9 percent. **********Many of these companies have ranked among the leaders in growth over the last 14 years.

The increase, along with an upward revision of January's figure, gave economists renewed confidence that 1986 would be a year of healthy growth. **********Many analysts, while seeing long-term gains from lower interest rates and oil prices, have worried that the course of the economy has been spotty. Some signs of weakness, they say, have been a jump in unemployment in February and slow auto sales. **********But yesterday's Commerce Department report, following news earlier this week of a smaller trade deficit, gave economists and Government officials some reassurance. Sprinkel Cites Consistency **********''The main thing is, it looks very good,'' Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said of the report. ''It's consistent with everything else we see.'' **********Douglas P. Handler, an economist at Wharton Econometrics, a Philadelphia forecasting firm, said, ''People are more optimistic about the first half of 1986; the second half has always looked good in everyone's eyes.'' **********The index of leading economic indicators is intended to predict economic activity six to nine months in the future. But some business analysts forecast quicker improvement this time because of such fundamental factors as low oil prices and interest rates. Some Unreliability Seen **********To be sure, some economists place little confidence in the index, saying it is not always reliable. It can overstate the direction of the economy, or ignore new factors that are playing a role in a changing economy, they say. **********Nonetheless, the figures released yesterday are a positive sign to many economists. **********''The data for the last two or three months reflect an economy that was weak in trade and manufacturing, but one that is now emerging from a slumber,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Wall Street firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ''I do not deviate from my earlier view that we will see 3.5 percent to 4 percent real growth in G.N.P. for all of 1986; that kind of growth will be ideal.'' **********Of the 12 indicators that make up the index, five - new orders for plant and equipment, stock prices, money-supply data, new business formations and information on vendor delivery times - suggested improvements ahead. **********But six other components suggested sluggish growth. They were unemployment claims, the length of the average workweek, new orders for consumer goods, building permits for new houses, borrowings by businesses and individuals and changes in commodity prices. The indicator relating to changes in inventories was unavailable. **********Because the Government, to compute the index, weights the first group of indicators more heavily than the second, the index, over all, pointed to a crisp expansion. **********The Government also said the January change in the index, which was reported as a drop of six-tenths of 1 percent, was revised upward on the basis of new data to show no change. With the January revision, the index has now gone without a decline for 10 months. **********If the gross national product should grow 4 percent, the rate the Reagan Administration predicts, it would mean a continued buildup in employment without fueling inflation, economists say. **********On the other hand, such growth would probably end the dramatic decline in interest rates that is behind the rallies in the stock and bond markets. That is because interest rates tend to stabilize or rise as businesses compete for financing to conduct their busier operations. Also, analysts said, the Federal Reserve would be loath to use its power to send rates lower if it saw the economy expanding rapidly. **********Bond prices could be expected to stop rising. ''This definitely limits the potential for future gains in bonds,'' Mr. Sinai said of the leading indicators. Weak Growth in 1985 **********While cautioning against inferring too much from one month's numbers, most economists agreed that it seemed likely that the economy would perform better this year than last. In 1985, the economy grew a weak 2.2 percent, and in the final quarter growth was an anemic seven-tenths of 1 percent. **********Most economists say a number of factors are in place that will speed things up. Oil prices have fallen sharply, inflation remains low, interest rates are at their lowest levels of the decade and the dollar has plunged against other currencies, helping exports. These conditions should translate into increased economic activity. **********But not all economists are counting on fast growth. Some note that two important industries, agriculture and energy, are in turmoil because of depressed prices for their commodities. They also point to a decline in auto sales and the continued flood of imports. **********''Business will be fine, but it certainly won't be the year of the tiger,'' said Joseph Wahed, chief economist at the Wells Fargo Corporation, the San Franciso banking company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/02/business/allied-lyons-unit-chairman.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Allied-Lyons Unit Chairman", "print_headline": "Allied-Lyons Unit Chairman", "body_text": " **********Allied-Lyons P.L.C. said yesterday that it had named Charles E.

Technological advances have made the papers look better, and consumer product companies are pouring in ads. **********Apparently, word is out that college papers deliver a deep-pockets audience. There are about 12.4 million full- and part-time graduate and undergraduate students in the country. Market researchers say they spend approximately $34 billion a year on retail goods and services. And, just as important, researchers indicate they are faithful readers of their college papers. **********''College newspapers fill a special niche,'' said Carleton W. Bryant, vice president of the American Passage Media Corporation, an advertising representative that specializes in the college market. ''They serve an isolated community with a desire and need for news and information.'' **********A study by the Simmons Market Research Bureau this year found that college papers are the mostly widely read medium on most campuses. At Manhattan's Columbia University, for example, The Daily Spectator was read at least once a week by 97 percent of the student body. None of the city's commercial newspapers was as popular. **********National advertisers have begun to take note of that popularity and of the college newspapers' low advertising rates (usually less than $10 per column inch). ''The market has continued to grow over the past decade,'' said Mark W. Rose, executive vice president of CASS Communications Inc., another advertising representative specializing in college newspapers. National advertisers now pour $40 million annually into campus publications across the country, he said. **********Local advertisers supply even more, with the result that total revenues at the nation's 1,300 college newspapers now surpass $100 million annually. Since the papers are put out almost entirely by student volunteers, operating costs have traditionally been negligible.

Kerschner, chairman of the investment policy committee, said yesterday. **********He added that, thanks to the recent sharp drop in interest rates, he was more bullish about prospects for equities than at any time since the beginning of the bull market in August 1982. **********''We now believe the odds are 4 to 1 in favor of stocks outperforming bonds in the months ahead,'' Mr. Kerschner said. ''That represents a big reversal from our thinking back in June 1984, when the odds heavily favored bonds.'' **********It is the stunning rally in bond prices, as other Wall Street professionals readily concede, that has fueled the continuing rally in stocks. Yesterday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.02 points, closing at a new high of 1,821.72. **********Since last May, yields on long-term Treasury bonds have moved below 11 percent, and yesterday they traded at levels to yield less than 7.80 percent. **********Only two stocks among the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average - General Electric and Sears, Roebuck - appear on Paine Webber's list of investment recommendations. **********''The proposed acquisition of RCA is consistent with management's strategy to increase the proportion of General Electric's business in technology and services,'' the brokerage firm said. ''We view RCA as a good fit with G.E. - one that enhances its position in world markets.'' **********The Sears centennial celebration, which started last November and extends through this year, is viewed as likely to increase the company's merchandising volume with the introduction of new products. In citing other favorable factors, Paine Webber said, ''As the dominant durable-goods retailer, Sears should benefit from the anticipated upturn in housing starts.'' **********A number of financial service issues are recommended. These include two money-center banks in New York City -Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover -along with Security Pacific, which is based in Los Angeles. **********Another suggestion that fits into the general category of financial services is Phibro-Salomon. **********''This issue has dramatically underperformed the market indices since last summer and at 12 times our estimated earnings for 1986 the stock is selling at a price/earnings discount to the market,'' according to Paine Webber. ''We believe a premium multiple is justified in view of its high secular growth rate.'' **********Rounding out the recommended list are Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers, Chrysler, Circuit City Stores, GAF Corporation, Gillette, Hospital Corporation of America, McGraw-Hill, National Medical Enterprises, Ralston Purina, Rockwell International, Times Mirror, Toys ''R'' Us and Zayre. **********Paine Webber also listed 15 ''unattractive'' issues that it expects to perform less well than the overall market during the next six to 12 months. One fairly common theme running through this group is that many of the stocks are related to capital goods and basic industries. **********In discussing Alcoa, for example, the firm stated: ''We recommend selling these shares into current market strength, based on an overly rosy consensus outlook.'' **********Several semiconductor issues - Advanced Micro Devices, National Semiconductor and Texas Instruments - are also regarded as unattractive. As for National Semiconductor, the brokerage firm said, ''It may return to profitability in fiscal 1987 after a substantial loss projected for the year ending in May 1986, but the risks are high.'' **********Other stocks cited as unattractive in the firm's estimation are Alcan Aluminium, Caterpillar Tractor, Cross & Trecker, Deere, Freeport-McMoran, Hewlett-Packard, McDermott International, Phelps Dodge, Newmont Mining, Roadway Services and U.S. Steel. **********There is no guarantee, of course, that the recommended issues are poised for market stardom or that the stocks considered unattractive will, indeed, lag in coming months. Some issues in the latter category are viewed more hospitably at other brokerage houses. **********Prudential-Bache Securities, for example, calls Texas Instruments an issue to ''accumulate'' over the next six months. ''We believe that the present valuation of Texas Instruments doesn't yet reflect the potential for a strong and sustained semiconductor industry recovery next year,'' it said. **********In terms of asset allocation for a typical balanced account, Paine Webber suggests holding 62 percent in stocks, 32 percent in bonds and 6 percent in cash. ''Six months ago,'' Mr. Kerschner said, ''we were recommending that these accounts hold 47 percent in stocks and 47 percent in bonds, along with 6 percent cash.'' **********In each of the last two years, he added, Paine Webber's equity recommendations beat Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by approximately five percentage points on the basis of total return, or market appreciation plus dividends. The S.&P. index showed a total return of 31.79 percent last year and 6.1 percent in 1984. Another Pre-Easter Advance **********The stock market made a bow in the direction of history yesterday by advancing in the session prior to the long Easter weekend. In 20 of the 26 previous years, prices moved higher that day, according to Newton D. Zinder, technical analyst for E. F. Hutton & Company.

Heating oil and gasoline prices also jumped. **********Prices on all longer-term contracts were up by the daily limit. In response, the exchange said it would expand the limits on all contracts today, to $1.50 on crude oil contracts and to 3 cents on contracts for petroleum products. **********At yesterday's opening, market participants bid up prices in reaction to the dismissal of the Saudi oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani. **********However, the bulk of the increase came later, after Hisham Nazer, Sheik Yamani's successor, called for an emergency meeting of the pricing committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. At the meeting, expected to be held in the next few weeks, Mr. Nazer said he intended to propose strategies that would push oil prices to $18 a barrel. **********Mr. Nazer's announcement apparently stirred enough hope to dispel doubts about how his goal might be reached. Indeed, a number of oil analysts were surprised by the action of the futures markets. Late Wednesday night, many had predicted that prices would fall in response to Sheik Yamani's dismissal. **********Prices did indeed drop for a short time during trading in London, but later the price of North Sea Brent, Britain's benchmark crude, rallied to around $13.60 for November delivery. **********''I don't have a good explanation at all for the day's activity,'' said Philip K. Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''Everything I see suggests that the Saudis want to sell more oil at a higher price, and that is an inconsistent set of objectives. This is a classic case of hope that the Saudis will do something without much basis in fact.'' **********The unrelenting fact that traders chose to ignore yesterday is the vast oversupply of oil on world markets, a surplus that Mr. Verleger estimated could be 400 million barrels. **********David Morrison, a vice president and chief international economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said, ''The only thing the Saudis can do to force the price up is to cut production again, which they don't want to do. To get prices up to $18 a barrel they would have to cut production from nearly 4.5 million barrels a day right now to around 1 million to 1.5 million barrels.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/05/business/thrift-board-s-travel-policy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 268, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Thrift Board's Travel Policy", "print_headline": "Thrift Board's Travel Policy", "body_text": " **********Edwin J.

Koch should tire of struggling with the problems of New York City, he has a standing offer to swap jobs from a man who reckons he has a still tougher city to run: Chen Xitong, Mayor of Peking. **********Not that Mayor Chen thinks he could do any better than Mr. Koch. ''I'd give myself a week before they'd chase me out of town,'' he said recently, chuckling as he recalled discussing a job trade with his New York counterpart during a visit to the United States in 1982. ''But Mr. Koch taking over here? I'd give him a day.'' **********A visit to the Mayor's office in the gray stone mansion that housed the Japanese legation to the Manchu throne suggests that humor is a requirement for the job. Mr. Chen governs a population of 9.5 million that has long outgrown its transportation system and its housing, that struggles each winter with a huge pollution problem and that is paying the penalty of trying to squeeze three decades of development into one. **********A Populist Approach **********Despite disaffection that has seen people from the countryside staging a sit-in on the steps of the city's Communist Party headquarters and bus drivers staging an unheard-of slowdown strike, Peking's Mayor is a popular man. In a society with a long tradition of elitism, he has a populist approach that gets him out among the common people who have no vote for city officials and no institutionalized way of making their opinions known. **********Every now and then, Mr. Chen rises at 6 A.M. at his home in eastern Peking and rides the No. 204 bus into the city, jostling with riders eager to voice complaints about housing, unresponsive city officials or the corruption scandal that has sent top officials from the city's utilities bureau to jail. **********On a tour of the city's markets recently, he took over from a vegetable salesman to hear complaints about rising food prices, and on other occasions he has broken off from official tours to inspect public washrooms or to upbraid citizens for spitting in the streets. **********Washroom tours are a personal trademark, the legacy of the years that the Mayor, 56 years old, spent as a toilet cleaner during the decade of Mao's Cultural Revolution. **********A Sichuanese who graduated with a degree in literature from Peking University, Mr. Chen divided the years after 1966 between mop and pail and more than 300 ''struggle sessions'' with Red Guards - interludes of verbal and physical abuse for those deemed guilty of transgressions against Mao's ''revolutionary'' teachings. Rehabilitated by Deng **********Mr. Chen was party boss in Changpin County, a rural district of Peking, when Mao declared open season on the bureaucracy. He owes his rehabilitation to Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, himself a survivor of ''struggling'' with Red Guards, whose post-1978 administration was largely composed of fellow victims of Mao. **********Mr. Chen became Peking's Deputy Mayor in 1979 and got the top job - at a monthly salary of $93.75 - in 1983. **********Current orthodoxy has it that the Cultural Revolution was all bad, but it had a redeeming quality for Mr. Chen. **********''For most officials, and for China as a whole, the Cultural Revolution was a total waste of time,'' he said on a recent weekend afternoon. ''But being required to work as a toilet cleaner meant that I got to know a lot of ordinary people, people working as garbage collectors, street cleaners, and the like. For me, that was a good education, something to be savored from so much else that was bad.'' An Uncommon Tolerance **********Perhaps as a consequence, the Mayor has shown uncommon tolerance toward those who challenge the city's authority. After several hundred young people staged their sit-in at the party headquarters last year demanding the right to return permanently from their rural ''re-settlement'' under Mao, Mr. Chen met with the leaders and persuaded them to disperse. Earlier this year, he adopted similar tactics with bus drivers who were staging a slowdown strike to protest poor pay. **********In a party that has acted ruthlessly in defense of its powers, the Mayor's response invited criticism for irresolution. But Mr. Chen, a member of the party's 210-member Central Committee, has close ties with Mr. Deng and the Prime Minister, Zhao Ziyang. **********By avoiding strong-arm tactics, the city gave a demonstration of how social freedoms have broadened under Mr. Deng - and did so without having to breach policies that had aroused the ire of the protesters and the bus drivers in the first place. Sticking His Neck Out **********On other occasions, the Mayor has stuck his neck out on issues he could have avoided. When Peking University students caused a stir last fall with protests against nepotism and set off a round of similar protests by senior officials, Mr. Chen sounded a countervailing note. One of the students' targets was Ye Xuanping, newly appointed Governor of Guangdong Province, who is the son of Marshal Ye Jianying, a close associate of Mr. Deng. **********At a student forum, Mr. Chen hit back. ''When he was a chief engineer, I was merely a worker,'' he said of the younger Mr. Ye. ''Now that I have become a Mayor, why can't he be a provincial governor?'' **********Mr. Chen's contacts with national leaders have more taxing side, since he must align the central Government's master plan for the capital with realities confronting any big-city mayor. In recent years, many visitors to Peking have been dismayed by the down-at-the-heels look of a city that was once one of the world's architectural gems, and part of Mr. Deng's ''modernization'' drive has been to give the country a capital it can take pride in. 'Paying the Penalty' **********This has involved a drive to upgrade the city's relics, including such fabled inheritances as the Ming Tombs. In addition, huge sums have been spent on building new scientific institutes, concert halls, five-star hotels and Government ministries, along with apartments for 500,000 people and new ''ring roads'' to untangle traffic jams brought on by 300,000 cars and trucks, a threefold increase in 10 years. **********After a quarter of a century of retarded development under Mao, in Mr. Chen's words, ''We are paying the penalty for past mistakes.'' **********The boom has turned much of the capital into a construction site. Compared with 1966, the eight years of building have doubled the size of the city, causing headaches for Mr. Chen. **********Although the central Government has capped Peking's population at 10 million, 3.8 million of them peasants living within a 30-mile radius, the city is stifling under the the growth. Hundreds of new high-rises have no running water, no gas and no power to run elevators. Said Mr. Chen, ''It's a problem to make everything fit.'' **********To manage it all, Mr. Chen has a budget of $1.1 billion, a fraction of New York City's. But by the Mayor's reckoning, Peking has done at least as well at managing its problems as its sister city, and in some respects even better. **********''I get worried if I have even 16 serious crimes in a day,'' he said. ''How may does Mr. Koch have to worry about? Ten thousand? And a Central Park that nobody dares walk in at night? No, perhaps I won't make that job exchange after all.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/10/business/business-technology-advances-formula-aids-planners-at-bell-labs.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1986-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 581, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FORMULA AIDS PLANNERS AT BELL LABS", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY: ADVANCES; FORMULA AIDS PLANNERS AT BELL LABS", "body_text": " **********A new mathematical formula for solving staggeringly complex variations on the ''traveling salesman's problem'' - finding the most efficient route for visiting a number of cities - is now being used successfully at Bell Laboratories to plan the growth of the national long-distance telephone network of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********Moreover, officials say the formula, known as the Karmarkar algorithm (after Narendra Karmarkar, the Bell Labs mathematician who developed it in 1984), has now been incorporated into a computer program that will soon be available for licensing to airlines, oil companies, brokerage firms and other businesses that could save millions of dollars through more efficient allocation of resources. **********Scientists recently applied the formula to one of the most complicated problems ever attempted: deciding where to route telephone traffic and where to build network links between thousands of cities in the most cost-efficient manner. Using conventional methods, the task, which involves more than 800,000 variables and involves a process called linear programming, could require days or weeks of computer time. The Karmarkar algorithm raced through the exercise in about 10 hours. **********''This new tool provides a higher quality answer that yields more capacity at lower costs,'' said Nat Levine, director of the transmission facility planning center at Bell Labs. ''Even if it saves only 1 percent of the overall cost of the project, the savings could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.'' **********Airlines could use the Karmarkar algorithm in solving many problems, such as crew scheduling. A large airline has about 6,000 pilots, 9,000 flight attendants, 320 aircraft and about 1,500 departures a day. In addition, the algorithm has potential use for corporations that manage billions of dollars and need linear programming formulas that maximize the use of capital. Another area is factory resource management, in which companies attempt to minimize their inventories to reduce carrying charges. **********The conventional way to examine such problems is called the simplex method. It represents the problem geometrically, in essence as a geodesic sphere with thousands of sides, and tests each possible solution in sequence. It is a comparatively slow procedure that works best on problems with no more than 15,000 to 20,000 variables. **********By contrast, the Karmarkar algorithm in effect transforms the sphere, pulling various solutions into the center so that it is able to find the optimum answer much faster. **********With the algorithm, long-distance network committees can easily accommodate updated forecasts in telephone traffic, connections between cities and types of connection materials. **********Last week the Bell Labs scientists cut the amount of time required to solve the problem to less than 10 hours from the original 30. ''We looked at the solution and altered both the hardware and software to make it run even faster, and we keep doing that,'' Mr. Levine said. ''One of the reasons we want to get running time down is that we want to run the algorithm on problems that have never been attempted before.'' **********To help the planners understand the solutions generated by the Karmarkar algorithm, Bell scientists are developing a software system that explains how the formula designs a solution. **********Although Bell Labs cannot patent the algorithm because it is an idea, the research lab can sell it in the form of computer software programs.

Since the outset of the controversy over our policy relating to Iran, I've done everything in my power to make all the facts concerning this matter known to the American people. I can appreciate why some of these things are difficult to comprehend, and you're entitled to have your questions answered. And that's why I've pledged to get to the bottom of this matter, and I've said earlier that I would welcome the appointment of an independent counsel to look into allegations of illegality in the sale of arms to Iran and the use of funds from these sales to assist the forces opposing the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua. **********This morning, Attorney General Meese advised me of his decision that his investigation has turned up reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation by an independent counsel would be appropriate. Accordingly, consistent with his responsibilities under the Independent Counsel Act, I immediately urged him to apply to the court here in Washington for the appointment of an independent counsel. **********Meeting With Review Board **********Yesterday, I had my first meeting with the special review board. That review board is made up of three men of unquestioned integrity and broad experience in foreign and national security policy. In a meeting with the board, they promised me a tough, no-nonsense investigation and I promised them the full cooperation of the White House staff and all agencies of the Executive branch. No area of the N.S.C. staff activities will be immune from review. And when the board reports to me, I intend to make their conclusions and recommendations available to Congress and to the American people. **********With the appointment of an independent counsel, we will have in place a dual system for assuring a thorough review of all aspects of this matter. If illegal acts were undertaken, those who did so will be brought to justice. If actions in implementing my policy were taken without my authorization, knowledge or concurrence, this will be exposed and appropriate corrective steps will be implemented. **********I recognize fully the interest of Congress in this matter and the fact that in performing this important oversight and legislative role, Congress will want to inquire into what occurred. We will cooperate fully with these inquiries. I have already taken the unprecedented step of permitting two of my former national security advisers to testify before a committee of Congress. **********These Congressional inquiries should continue, but I do believe Congress can carry out its duties in getting the facts without disrupting the orderly conduct of a vital part of this nation's government. Accordingly, I am urging the Congress to consider some mechanism that will consolidate its inquiries. Such a step has already been requested by several members of Congress. I support the idea. **********In closing, I want to state again that it is my policy to oppose terrorism throughout the world, to punish those who support it and to make common cause with those who seek to suppress it. This has been my policy and will continue to be my policy. **********If the investigative processes now set in motion are given an opportunity to work, all the facts concerning Iran and the transfer of funds to assist the anti-Sandinista forces will shortly be made public.

Dubinin to the annual Pamplona running of the bulls two summers ago, Mr. Dubinin, then Soviet Ambassador to Spain. accepted with enthusiasm. **********Faithful to tradition, he donned an open shirt and a ''panuelico,'' the red handkerchief that demonstrates solidarity with the young men who run with the bulls. At a welcoming ceremony at City Hall, he charmed officials of the medieval hill town, telling them in Spanish that he knew about bullfighting from reading Ernest Hemingway, a popular author in the Soviet Union. **********But the personal affability of Mr. Dubinin, 55 years old, who was named ambassador to Washington today, contrasts with his professional demeanor in his advocacy of Soviet foreign policy. **********In his two months at the United Nations, Mr. Dubinin has not had the time to make much of a positive impression on his Western colleagues. **********In his maiden speech here, he accused the United States of ''large-scale political sabotage against the United Nations'' by insisting that the Soviet Union reduce the staff of his missions. **********And in a Security Council debate on the American bombing of Libya, he echoed his Government's characterization of the raid as ''banditry.'' **********Born in Moscow on Oct. 7, 1930, Yuri Vladimirovich Dubinin studied history before joining the foreign service in 1955, according to an official biographical sketch in the Soviet Union's ''Diplomatic Dictionary,'' a standard reference work. In Unesco Secretariat in 50's **********After brief posting at the Soviet Embassy in Paris, he was assigned in 1956 to the secretariat of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in Paris, where he worked three years before returning to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow. **********Through the 1960's and 1970's, he alternated between increasingly responsible positions in the embassy in Paris and in the Foreign Ministry in Moscow, where he was attached to the First European Department, which oversees relations with France, Italy, the Benelux countries, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland. In 1971, he became the chief of the department. **********In 1978, he was given his first ambassadorial post, in Madrid, a year after Soviet-Spanish diplomatic relations had been restored in the wake of the Franco era. **********Although Mr. Dubinin lacks the experience in American affairs associated with Anatoly F. Dobrynin, his predecessor in Washington, he had occasion to sharpen his East-West negotiating skills while serving on the Soviet delegation that helped prepare the 1975 Helsinki accord on East-West cooperation. Named in March to a Party Body **********While serving as ambassador in Spain, Mr. Dubinin also took part in the Madrid conference that reviewed the Helsinki accords from 1980 to 1983. **********Last March, at the 27th party congress, Mr. Dubinin was made a member of the party's Central Auditing Commission, which handles party finances. **********Mr. Dubinin's appointment to the Washington job, one of the Soviet Union's important diplomatic posts, startled some diplomats here. They noted what they considered a handicap, at least initially, for his work in Washington: He has been using an interpreter in conversing with English-speakers here. **********''I only understand positive statements in English,'' he once quipped to reporters here. **********However, he is regarded as gifted in languages and is studying English with a tutor. **********''One can say he has made tremendous progress since he arrived here,'' said Anatoly Khudyakov, a spokesman for the Soviet mission.

Walters, the chief American delegate at the United Nations, has been speaking with him in French. **********Mr. Dubinin's wife, Liana, also speaks French as a result of their prolonged stays in Paris. Their three children do not live with them in New York. **********When Claude de Kemoularia of France, as the Security Council president last month, stopped a speech by Mr. Dubinin because no French interpreter was immediately available, Mr. Dubinin briefly switched to French, asking jokingly whether he should give his remarks in French. **********''He speaks a beautiful French, he knows French politics and French literature,'' Mr. de Kemoularia said.

Laurel included such key issues as financial aid and the depth of United States support for the new Manila Government, particularly in connection with the deposed President, Ferdinand E. Marcos. **********Tension was also apparent today as Mr. Reagan met with all six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in a session that focused on trade frictions. The members of Asean constitute a bloc that is the fifth largest trade partner of the United States. **********Session With Indonesians **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz said that in a separate session with Indonesian officials before the joint meeting, the United States had raised the issue of increasing foreign investments here. A senior Administration official had said beforehand that the approach would provide an indirect way of addressing the issue of corruption in President Suharto's Government. **********Speaking to reporters after the meeting with Mr. Laurel, Mr. Shultz used unusually tart language to criticize what he said was the Vice President's demands for more American aid. **********''Vice President Laurel, I must say, gave the impression that his needs were infinite, and we don't have an infinite capacity to provide money,'' Mr. Shultz said. **********On Wednesday, Mr. Laurel said in an interview that his Government was beset by problems and would need ''much more'' than the $150 million in additional aid announced last week by Mr. Reagan. **********The Administration hopes to provide about $500 million to the Government of President Corazon C. Aquino over the next few months, including $150 million in additional military and economic aid that Mr. Reagan urged before leaving Washington last Thursday. **********But some Philippine officials had complained that the nation's treasury was depleted by Mr. Marcos and that greater assistance was necesssary. White House officials described the private meeting between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Laurel as ''correct'' but lacking real warmth. **********In addition to the financing disagreement, officials said Mr. Reagan and Mr. Shultz were also irritated by Mr. Laurel's public demand for direct, personal assurances of support from Mr. Reagan at a time when, they said, the President's commitment was already obvious. 'Cobwebs of Doubt' Seen **********Mr. Laurel said last week and again Wednesday that he wanted Mr. Reagan to clear away ''cobwebs of doubt'' about his support for the Aquino Government and his feelings about Mr. Marcos. **********Mr. Shultz, speaking in a brisk tone, said Mr. Reagan had made it clear that he supported the new Government. ''And since Vice President Laurel used that expression, you'll have to ask him if the cobwebs are still there,'' Mr. Shultz added. **********The Secretary pointed to a third area of contention by challenging the Aquino Government's refusal to give Mr. Marcos a passport that would allow him to leave Honolulu for residence in Spain or some other country. **********''We do feel that it would be well if the Philippine Government had an attitude toward possible movement by Mr. Marcos that was a little different from what they have, and we'd like to see him able to move to another country if he wishes to do so,'' Mr. Shultz said. **********He said the United States had been the first nation to recognize the Aquino Government, had immediately sent officials to survey the situation and had later sent Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger there. Plans to Stop in Manila **********Then the Administration made ''a decision, given all of our own budgetary problems, to add $150 million to our aid program,'' said Mr. Shultz, who is to stop by the Philippines after the Tokyo economic summit meeting, which begins Sunday. **********Mr. Shultz's comments on Mr. Marcos came as a surprise in that the Administration has generally avoided discussions of his future. It has, for example, said it would let the courts handle disputes over recovering wealth he may have improperly accumulated during his 20-year rule, although the Aquino Government has wanted assistance in recouping property in the United States. **********Mr. Shultz's tone was sharpest when he said, in response to questions about Mr. Reagan's support for the Aquino Government, ''Let me remind you the President is not on trial.'' **********Although the Secretary later denied that his comments reflected displeasure with the meeting, a senior official said Mr. Shultz was accurately reflecting the main disagreements between the two Governments. **********''It just seemed curious to us that there was not a better perception of where we were coming from on our capacity to provide aid, our approach to Marcos and quite frankly our real commitment to the Aquino Government,'' the official said. Sharp Response to Indonesian **********Mr. Shultz also provided a sharp response to a statement made by the Indonesian Foreign Minister at the start of a meeting with Asean foreign ministers. As Mr. Reagan looked on, the Indonesia, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, said the United States should facilitate access of Asean's products to American markets, adding, ''This is in line with the professed U.S. policy to encourage free trade.'' **********Mr. Shultz acknowedged later that he resented Mr. Mochtar's use of ''professed.'' He said, ''As far as the President's credentials on the fight against protection, they've very strong. **********''Unfortunately, there are a lot of people in our Congress who don't agree with him, so we have a big battle on our hands continously, but the President is leading that fight,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''And I think everyone recognizes that there's no such thing as his 'professed.' '' **********The meeting was the first between Mr. Reagan and the six Asean members - Brunei, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. It capped a three-day stay by Mr. Reagan in this resort area, which he leaves Friday for his sixth summit meeting of leading industrialized democracries. ---- 'Marshall Plan' Is Asked WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) -The new Philippine Ambassador to the United States today urged a huge ''Marshall Plan'' of United States economic aid to Manila to help the Government overcome ''insurmountable problems'' left behind by former President Ferdinand Marcos. **********In his first major speech since arriving in Washington 10 days ago, Ambassador Emmanuel Pelaez said the Aquino Government was grateful for President Reagan's offer of an extra $150 million in economic, military and food aid for 1986. But he said Mr. Marcos had left his country with such ''insurmountable problems'' that only assistance similar to the Marshall Plan's postwar aid to Europe would suffice. **********Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Washington Institute for Values in Public Policy, Mr. Pelaez said of his country, ''Left to itself at this time, it will fall prey to despair which would drive our people down the leftist road to disaster.'' ----Reagan Flies to Tokyo DENPASAR, Indonesia, Friday, May 2 (AP) - President Reagan boarded Air Force One this morning for a more than seven-hour flight to Tokyo.

New Penalties **********The new law also imposes new penalties that will make withdrawing funds early from a retirement plan more expensive. With few exceptions, the same 10 percent excise tax that now applies to withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts by people who have not reached age 59 1/2 or become disabled is extended to most retirement plans beginning Jan. 1. **********Even when the funds are withdrawn at retirement, the tax treatment will be substantially changed. Lump-sum distributions will come under new rules. And Government workers who retired after last July 1 have to start paying taxes on part of their pension checks immediately. They will no longer have a three-year tax-free period as under the old law, which treated initial payments as a return of their personal after-tax contributions. **********Top executives will find new limits on the amount of salary they can shelter through company plans and the amount of benefits they get when they retire early. These changes will encourage many executives to renegotiate their compensation agreements to assure that the benefits are made up elsewhere. **********Companies are already busy trying to figure out how to adjust their retirement programs to meet the requirements of the new law. **********''To the extent employers are modifying their programs, employees are going to have to analyze how it affects their particular circumstances,'' said Andrew Zuckerman, an employee benefits specialist at the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Company. **********Indeed, many companies will need to modify their pension plans substantially to retain their tax-favored status. **********''Thousands of plans are going to be disqualified,'' said Harold Dankner, a partner at the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand. Companies have until 1989 to meet many of the new standards. Employers face difficult choices. They will have to decide whether to simply absorb the added cost of increasing coverage and benefits for rank-and-file workers or reduce the benefits for others in order to contain costs. **********The costs can be significant, because the new rules will provide benefits for many workers for the first time. **********Workers will earn rights to their pension benefits much sooner beginning in 1989. Under the old law, most people have had to work 10 years for their company before they ''vested,'' or established full rights to their pension benefits. If the employee left the company earlier, he or she typically left without a cent in benefits. The new law will require 100 percent vesting after the employee completes five years of service. Social Security Provision **********The only other option the employer has is to follow a schedule that gives employees 20 percent vesting after three years, gradually rising each year until 100 percent is vested after seven years of service. **********In addition, companies that link the size of pension payouts to the employee's Social Security benefits will not be able to reduce his or her pension benefits by more than 50 percent beginning in 1989. **********If you receive a lump-sum distribution from a pension or profit-sharing plan, you have a couple of choices. You can take the money in hand and pay tax on it. Or you can roll it over into an Individual Retirement Account, where you can further defer paying taxes on the money. **********If you take the money, the law provides a special formula for computing tax that eases the bite. The old law allowed capital gains tax treatment for the portion of the distribution that represented the time you were in the pension plan before 1974. The tax on the rest of the funds could be computed using a favorable 10-year income averaging method. **********The new law phases out the use of capital gains treatment over a six-year period, and scales back 10-year averaging to five-year averaging. In addition, the new law restricts the five-year averaging method to a single lump-sum distribution received after 59 1/2. **********If you reached age 50 before Jan. 1, 1986, you are given special protection from the tax changes. **********First, you can take advantage of capital gains treatment for the pre-1974 portion of your lump-sum payment without regard to the six-year phase-out. **********Second, you have the choice of using either the new five-year averaging formula under the new lower tax rate schedule, or you can stick with the 10-year formula using the higher tax rates that were in effect for 1986. You will have to make the calculation to determine which method is more beneficial. A Lump-Sum Payment **********Third, you can use the special tax treatment on a lump-sum payment received either before or after you reach age 59 1/2. But you have only one chance. So if you have more than one lump-sum distribution coming, you will have to decide which one you want to have the special treatment apply to. **********If you do not need all of the lump-sum payment right away, rolling the money into an I.R.A. may be a more attractive option. ''Unless you have a large pre-1974 distribution, an individual is invariably better off rolling it into an I.R.A. and taking it out over a period of time,'' said Mr. Zuckerman of Arthur Andersen. **********Executives who retire early will find that the benefits they are allowed to receive from a defined benefit pension plan are sharply reduced. The new law retains the maximum $90,000-a-year benefit cap. But it reduces the limit for people who retire before they reach Social Security retirement age, which is now 65 but gradually increases to age 67 in the next century. **********These actuarial reductions can be substantial. Under the old law, for instance, the $90,000 benefit could be paid to people retiring as early as age 62. But the new law will reduce the limit to about $72,000 for people born before 1938 and to between $63,000 and $67,500 for people born later. The reductions are even more dramatic for people who retire at age 55. The old law allowed as much as a $75,000 benefit. But the new law reduces that to less than $40,000 for people born before 1938 and to as low as $35,000 for others, based on certain actuarial assumptions. **********Previously accrued benefits are protected. So an executive who is 62 and has accrued a $90,000 benefit will still be able to get the $90,000 benefit if he retires early. But a 50-year-old executive who planned to retire at age 55 and had benefits accrued up to the new limits would be bound by the new limits. Supplemental Benefits **********Many top executives will not be hurt by the changes. Most large companies have so-called unfunded plans from which supplemental benefits can be paid to executives. These unfunded plans do not fall under the same tough restrictions as tax-favored pension plans. **********''The limitations are becoming so severe that I think more and more executives are going to be looking to supplemental arrangements to protect their income,'' said Everett T. Allen, a vice president at Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, a management consulting firm. **********The problem is that these supplemental arrangements are unsecured promises of the corporation. Another problem is that not all executives get covered by such plans. **********Because of these problems, some executives will likely try to renegotiate their compensation packages to obtain greater retirement income security by asking for a higher salary, which they can then invest on their own for retirement. **********Highly paid corporate executives will also run up against a new 15 percent excise tax when they withdraw very large amounts from tax-favored plans - including I.R.A.'s - in a single year. The tax is imposed on distributions in excess of $112,500 in one year. Lump-sum distributions are subject to a separate limitation of $562,500. The excise tax applies only to the amount in excess of those sums. Excess benefits accrued before Aug. 2, 1986, are generally protected from the tax.

Pennzoil said it ''previously has repeatedly advised Texaco that this type of proposal is unacceptable.'' Pennzoil and Texaco both declined to comment about the terms of the offer. **********Yesterday's events make it more likely that the two sides will drop their legal truce and return to the courts. They also make it more likely that Texaco might have to file for bankruptcy protection, a move it has said it might make if it is unable to get the protection it is seeking from the courts or from an agreement with Pennzoil. **********Sources close to the negotiations said yesterday that Texaco's latest offer had been formulated during an all-day, all-night strategy session at Texaco's headquarters in Harrison, N.Y., on Monday, and transmitted to Pennzoil yesterday. **********One source said the offer was the second formal proposal made by Texaco. The first was made several weeks ago, the source said, and was based on an exchange of oil and gas properties. Despite four negotiating sessions between top-level teams from both sides, including a meeting Sunday in Nashville, little progress had been made in narrowing the differences between the companies. **********Analysts said it was not surprising that Pennzoil had rejected Texaco's latest offer. Sources close to Pennzoil suggested that Pennzoil's management, led by its chairman and chief executive, J. Hugh Liedtke, had no desire to sell the company. They added that, even if Texaco were offering a huge premium, Pennzoil might not be getting a good deal if it concluded that it could eventually collect the $11.1 billion, with interest, awarded by the Texas court. **********In addition, personal animosity between the top executives of the companies is said to run high, complicating any deal in which both managements might take a role in running the combined companies. ''Those guys hate each other,'' said one analyst. May Be Back in Court Friday **********Lawyers for both companies were preparing late yesterday for the possibility that they might start arguing their cases in a Federal court as soon as tomorrow. The companies have scheduled time to appear before Judge Charles Brieant in the United States District Court in White Plains tomorrow afternoon if they decide to go back to court, although it remained unclear last night whether that hearing would be held. **********Texaco asked Judge Brieant last month to stop Pennzoil from collecting the Texas jury's award before Texaco had a chance to appeal. Texaco also asked the judge to waive a requirement of Texas civil procedure that it post a bond for the $11 billion in order to appeal. **********Texaco is also expected to file today or tomorrow a motion asking the Texas state district court in Houston for a new trial. **********Some analysts questioned yesterday why Pennzoil had not put a stop to the market rumors by making an announcement earlier in the day as its stock price soared. **********A Pennzoil spokesman, Robert G. Harper, said he did not know whether Pennzoil's directors considered denying the rumor of an acquisition by Texaco before their meeting broke up around 6:30 P.M., two and a half hours after the stock market closed. **********He added, however, that ''as a matter of policy, we never comment on the price or volume movements of any of our securities.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/18/world/train-crash-kills-15-in-chile.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 42, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Train Crash Kills 15 in Chile", "print_headline": "Train Crash Kills 15 in Chile", "body_text": " **********At least 15 people were killed and 190 were injured tonight when two passenger trains collided on a bridge 20 miles east of Valparaiso, the Government said.

Officials said the theory had gained credence when a rebel leader, Adolfo Calero, had denied any knowledge of Swiss bank accounts. **********''We do not control a Swiss bank account, and we have not gotten any money from any Iranian connection,'' Mr. Calero said today. If the rebels themselves did not withdraw money from the accounts, the consultants or ''board of directors,'' probably did, Government officials said. **********Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d said today that the Justice Department was actively investigating several private consultants and others ''who have a tangential relationship with the U.S. Government'' for possible involvement in channeling Iranian money to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras. Associates Under Investigation **********Administration officials said investigators were looking at several people in particular, all current or former friends and associates of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, who was dismissed from the National Security Council staff on Tuesday. Mr. Meese said Colonel North had directed the Iran program by himself, and the colonel also directed the contra supply program over the last two years. **********Today one of Colonel North's close associates, who said he believed he would be questioned by the Justice Department although he maintained he had been unaware of the Iran transactions, said the Iranian money ''certainly would have gone through four or five laundering steps'' between the Swiss accounts and the contras. **********''It would have moved from Switzerland to the Bahamas, say, to the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong and then to Panama,'' he said. All those locations have strict bank-secrecy laws. **********''The question,'' a senior Administration official said, ''is who accomplished all that.'' **********The network used to transfer arms to Iran, like the contra supply network, has relied on Americans outside the Government, as well as Saudis, Iranians and Israelis, according to officials and sources familiar with it. Typically those involved are former Government employees or have close relations with one of the countries involved in the arms procurement. Calls From El Salvador **********Chief among the people to be investigated, several officials said, is Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general who is believed to have been a key figure in the contra supply program, according to Congressional investigators and other Government officials. Telephone records show that calls were made to Mr. Secord from ''safe houses'' in El Salvador used by members of the contra supply team. **********Through an attorney, Mr. Secord has denied any involvement. He has declined to respond to telephone calls. **********As it turns out, officials said, Mr. Secord was with Colonel North and Robert C. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, when they flew to Iran in May to negotiate with representatives of the Iranian Government. **********Another important associate of Colonel North, officials said, is Michael A. Ledeen, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies of Georgetown University. **********He has acknowledged that as a National Security Council consultant he helped set up the first contacts between Teheran and Washington but maintains that he was unaware of any link with the contras since his direct involvement with the program ended in November 1985. He declined to comment today. A Dozen Witnesses **********Robert Owen, another associate of Colonel North, is also likely to hear from the Justice Department investigators, officials said today. An investigation by the staff of Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, turned up at least a dozen witnesses who said Mr. Owen served as the colonel's liaison with the contras. Mr. Owen, a Washington consultant, has refused to say what role, if any, he played. **********Mr. Meese said the Justice Department had established that no senior White House officials had been involved in the program or even aware of it. But many officials in and out of the Government said they doubted whether Colonel North could have managed the program alone, as Mr. Meese asserted on Tuesday. **********Raymond Tanter, a senior National Security Council staff member until Colonel North took over his responsibilities in 1982, said today: ''I can't imagine that North could have gone around the system in that way. No one goes around the procedures.'' **********In addition to Americans, officials said, people close to several foreign governments are likely to turn up in investigative reports of the Iran-contra connection, even though they are not subject to prosecution in the United States. **********For example, the Iranian arms dealers Manucher Ghorbanifar and Cyrus Hashemi, who were reportedly involved in supplying arms to Iran and helping establish relations between Iran and the United States, had close relationships with certain Iranian officials. Close Friends of Peres **********Similarily, two Israeli arms dealers said to have been involved in transferring arms to Iran - Yaacov Nimrodi, a former Israeli military attache in Iran, and Al Schwimmer, an aircraft manufacturer - are close friends of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, officials said. **********Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi businessman and arms dealer who reportedly helped finance the Iranian purchase of United States arms, is close to some members of the Saudi royal family, according to a Khashoggi associate. **********The use of consultants and other individuals outside government for covert arms and money transactions offers several advantages, intelligence experts say. For example, such people are not subject to the same restrictions or accountability as are government employees. In addition, a government can officially and plausibly deny any involvement in a particular activity when it is carried out by consultants or someone in the private sector. **********But these advantages also raise questions in Congress, which is supposed to finance and oversee the Government. **********Several of the individuals identified as having been involved in arms transfers have served previously in the United States Government in military, intelligence or diplomatic areas, such as Mr. Secord, Mr. Owen and Mr. McFarlane. Intelligence experts said these people retained the skills of carrying out a covert or sensitive mission even after leaving the Government. **********For example, the use of false identification, Swiss bank accounts and money-laundering, all trademarks of government-sponsored covert activity, have been used in the Iran arms network and the contra supply operation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/28/world/around-the-world-us-and-greece-fail-to-reach-base-accord.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. and Greece Fail To Reach Base Accord", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; U.S. and Greece Fail To Reach Base Accord", "body_text": " **********The United States and Greece failed today to agree on the future of American military bases in Greece after the current agreement expires in 1988. **********But Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and Secretary of State George P.

Indeed. Their number almost doubled, to 26 from 14, reflecting what recent studies have demonstrated overwhelmingly: that America's economic elite is claiming an increasing share of the nation's income and wealth. The recently published Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans also shows that the net worth of these fortunate few rose $22 billion last year, to $156 billion. And, while many on the list made the bulk of their fortune in their lifetimes, it should surprise no one that 10 percent of them are descendants of Rockefellers, Mellons or Du Ponts. **********The share of income and wealth flowing to the rich has been expanding at the expense of the poor. The free-market policies that lie at the heart of the Reagan program have produced this redistribution, while conferring no compensating economic benefits. Instead, we have the worst of all possible worlds: rising inequality amid sluggish growth. **********There is no denying the trend toward inequality. It is revealed plainly in the statistics on wealth and income, which, it should be noted, move glacially, so a change of 1 or 2 percent is highly significant. **********The after-tax income of the richest fifth of American households rose from 40.6 percent to 42.3 percent of the total between 1980 and 1984. Meanwhile, the income shares of each of the other four-fifths declined. Since 1980, the real median income of the top 10 percent of the population has risen by $7,130, while that of the bottom 40 percent has fallen by $236. **********More remarkable, these trends are taking place against a backdrop of already enormous inequality. The richest 5 percent of Americans receive more income than the bottom 40 percent. The richest 1 percent own more assets than the bottom 90 percent. **********What is the source of this great, and apparently growing, inequality? **********In times past, large accumulations of wealth were the direct product of the coercive power of the state. Monarchs exacted tribute from the multitude, backed up by the power of the sword. Accumulating private wealth depended mainly on the favor of the state. As a result, the idea arose that, if the common people could free themselves of state intrusions, they might have a better chance of avoiding starvation. **********This ancient belief is thriving today. Limiting the economic role of government, it is claimed, will enhance opportunity for ordinary people. Yet this view ignores evidence that, today, inequality flows from an entirely different source. **********In our economic system, inequality derives from the working of unregulated markets. Capitalism is marked by constant change in technologies, products, raw-material needs and other factors. As these changes occur, some assets become temporarily in short supply while others experience surplus conditions. The key to riches in capitalism is to own or create something that is in short supply. While everyone in that happy position tends to attribute it to foresight and hard work, plain old luck plays a major role. Even if all property owners began with equal financial endowments and abilities, the interaction of ceaseless change and pure chance in competitive markets would generate inequality. **********But there is more than luck involved, because the chance of success in the future is not independent of past success. In other words, he who has, gets. Even more fundamental, not everyone starts out equal. In modern capitalism, the great majority of people are wage and salary workers, few of whom earn enough to enter the get-rich game. More than the price of a few lottery tickets is needed to enter the investment process that, with luck, might lead to great riches. The ''modest'' beginnings of some who strike it rich usually turn out to be well above the middle, as a perusal of the Forbes 400 shows. **********Why, then, does society tolerate such extreme inequality? THE MOST influential justification is that, however undesirable inequality might be on moral or political grounds, it is needed to promote saving and investment, since the rich save much of their income while the poor consume theirs. Thus, inequality engenders economic growth, which benefits the poor as well as the rich. **********Whatever truth this argument might once have held, it is irrelevant in modern capitalism. In America, about 80 percent of private saving is institutional rather than personal, so inequality in personal wealth can have only a marginal effect on saving. In the postwar decades, countries with much less unequal distributions of wealth and income, such as Japan and Sweden, have maintained much higher ratios of investment to gross national product than we have. In centrally planned economies, a very high degree of equality has co-existed with very high investment rates. **********There remains the claim that wealth inequality motivates people to work hard and be productive. This may be true, but it defies belief to claim that the example of billionaires is necessary for this purpose. Surely the prospect of possessing a paltry several million would bring most of the lesser endowed, and materially motivated, individuals to peak performance. It is said that Japanese workers and capitalists labor more diligently than their American counterparts, despite much smaller wealth at the top. **********If arguments in favor of inequality are so weak, why has the majority not exercised political power to redistribute income greatly in their favor? Part of the answer is that the rich are powerful, and past efforts to do just that, particularly in the 1930's, met only modest success against the resistance of the rich. But many in the middle accept inequality, largely because they dream of somehow crossing into the elite themselves. **********This is the great secret of the co-existence of democratic government and vast wealth inequality. Individual social mobility, however limited, does exist, as the presence on the Forbes list of such men as Sam Walton, the billionaire entrepreneur who holds the top position, bears out. Given mobility, the majority who do not make it tend to blame themselves. The truth that ''anyone can make it'' is mistaken for the falsehood that ''everyone can make it.'' **********The free market generates inequality. Political institutions that intervene in markets reduce inequality. Thus, labor unions, free or subsidized public goods, such as education, transportation or health care, and, of course, progressive taxation and government income maintenance programs reduce inequality. Such institutions - the legacy of the movement for equality - have been weakened by the free-market economic and social policies of recent years, and by hostility to unions. As one would expect, their deterioration has further heightened inequality, a trend reinforced by high unemployment. **********As the Forbes 400 illustrates so vividly, free market policy has produced not greater opportunity, but greater inequality. And to make matters worse, the rapid economic growth promised as the reward for these policies has not materialized."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/21/business/market-place-a-brisk-pace-is-set-by-nike.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1986-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 694, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; A Brisk Pace Is Set by Nike", "print_headline": "Market Place; A Brisk Pace Is Set by Nike", "body_text": " **********AMERICA'S broadening interest in running, aerobics and similar leisure activities has rekindled competition among the nation's leading publicly held producers of footwear. **********Nike of Beaverton, Ore., maker of Air Jordan basketball shoes, appears to be outrunning such competitors as Reebok International Ltd., Converse Inc. and Hyde Athletic Industries. **********Some analysts believe that Nike's stock represents the best value among athletic footwear companies and that the company is best positioned to profit from a business that has become increasingly segmented over the last couple of years. **********Nike, which had run up huge inventories in recent years in anticipation of a continuing 25 percent industrywide sales growth, was forced to cut prices to bring its production in line with sales. **********''They've gotten rid of their excess inventory -their biggest problem - over the last year and a half,'' said Margaret A.

Since 1982, revenues have advanced at a compound annual rate of 23.7 percent. **********The marketplace for Converse changed in 1985, however, as consumers shifted to more expensive soft-leather shoes such as Reebok's and high fashion leather basketball shoes such as Nike's Air Jordan. Converse's shoes continue to lose ground. The stock closed yesterday at $15.375 after trading over the counter in a range of $11.75 to $21.25 in the last 52 weeks. **********Hyde was founded in 1912, principally as a manufacturer of ice skates and roller skates. But it has evolved into an athletic footwear company through three subsidiaries - Saucony, Spot-Built and Hyde International. **********Hyde's operating margins and tax rates compare favorably with those of Nike and Converse, according to analysts, but recent results indicate that Hyde is encountering a surplus of slow-moving inventory.

Redman, a State Department spokesman, on the hijacking of a Pan American World Airways airliner in Karachi, Pakistan, as recorded by The New York Times:  WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING **********The hijacking of Pan American Airways Flight 73 at Pakistan's Karachi International Airport was a cruel and sinister terrorist act. Our hearts are filled with sympathy for the families of those innocents killed and injured. **********The Government of Pakistan acted boldly and decisively to bring this nightmare to an end, and we applaud Pakistan's exemplary resolve in handling this incident. **********Pan American Airways should also be commended for their cool and professional competence in helping to insure this incident could be concluded where it started. **********The terrorists conducted a despicable and cowardly crime by threatening, assaulting and murdering innocent passengers on a crowded airliner - men, women, young and old - with machine guns and hand grenades. Nothing can justify such barbarism. **********We can think of no punishment too severe for the criminals responsible. We are confident that those who perpetrated this brutal act will be brought to justice. **********We thank God this incident is now ended with the safe deliverance of most of those who had to endure the ordeal inflicted on them and of all civilized society. **********The President and the First Lady express their condolences to the families of those killed and pray for the speedy recovery of those injured. **********We look forward to the safe and speedy reunion of the passengers with their families and loved ones. Source of Terrorism **********Q. Larry, the President has, on the point of bringing people to justice, made clear in recent months that he intends to pursue to the source terrorism and try to punish those who perpetrate it and sponsor it, as in the case of Libya. Is he determined in this case to go to the source of whatever backing these people have and punish them? **********A. The President will work with the people of Pakistan, whatever assistance we can provide to see that those who were involved directly in this hijacking will be brought to justice. As of the moment our information has not allowed us to connect this incident with any country or any specific group. Q. Are you going to look for it? A. We will always vigilant in our efforts to find out who permits acts of terrorism to prevent them and if necessary to follow up on this by appropriate means. **********Q. Will all this be investigated by the U.S. Government as well as the Pakistanis? **********A. Well, certainly. We always work with a government in which an incident in which Americans' lives are lost and Americans are injured. We will work with the Pakistani Government on this matter. Q. No independent investigations? A. Well, you know, what do you mean by an independent investigation? Certainly we will use the means at our disposal to try to determine what happened there. But at the same time, this is a Pakistani matter. The Pakistani Government has been in charge from the start. The United States Government is ready and willing to cooperate with the Pakistani Government, but we commend the Pakistani Government for their courage, their ability to act in this matter and their ability to keep the plane where it was and end it where this started. **********Q. Last week officials were concerned of some possible increase in terrorist planning or activities by Colonel Qaddafi. One, is there any way of seeing from what we were surmising last week, the connection with Qaddafi, and two, do we appear to be on the verge of increased terrorist activity at this time? **********A. We can't make a judgment in either case, Frank, but as I stated we're unable at this time to make any connection with any government or any other specific group that would be responsible for this. We do know that Libya and Colonel Qaddafi have the capability to cause terrorist acts on a worldwide basis, but we cannot connect this one at this time. I think that pretty well sums up at this point. **********Q. Are you going to try to make a connection, or will you just let it lie? **********A. Certainly we will try to determine if there is any backing to these individuals. But at the moment we cannot make it. **********Q. It's been several hours since this thing went. Do you have hard numbers on how many people injured, how many dead, and if not, why do you think you don't have them? **********A. No, we don't have them. I think in any incident of this magnitude whether it be a terrorist incident or a national disaster, natural disaster, it's difficult to determine cause different people go to different locations for treatment. There's different reporting from different locations. Sometimes they're double counting. Sometimes some are missed. So we're just awaiting to be sure we have correct numbers. The Role of Pakistan **********Q. Larry, were we consulted by the Pakistanis at all on the possible use of force in settling the incident? **********A. Well, the decisions made in this incident were those made by the Pakistani Government. We did have an American Consul present in Karachi. We did have an Ambassador present in the capital. We were consulting, but the decisions that were made were made by the Pakistani Government. **********Q. Have whoever began the shooting - do we know whether the Pakistanis had begun a military attempt to resolve the issue at the time the shooting began? **********A. Our reporting, that the reporting that is coming from public sources and news media indicates that the shooting started on board the aircraft first. We're not prepared to draw those conclusions until we have an opportunity to look into it at its fullest extent. **********Q. Larry, was the President involved in ordering the aircraft carrier Forrestal to sail into the Mediterranean, and have those plans changed? **********A. The President has been actively involved in this incident since it occurred shortly after it occurred last evening, Pacific coast time. And the President has been involved in all decisions involving the U.S. in this matter. However, I'm not in a position to discuss fleet movements, and I'll refer you to the Pentagon for details. **********Q. What decisions, Larry, that the President's been involved in? **********A. Well, there are a number of decisions that the President has been involved in, has kept abreast of the events through the evening and again this morning. He was informed when the incident concluded aboard the aircraft, and he's been abreast during this afternoon. There were a number of decisions that the President was required to make, but I won't be specific about what they were. **********Q. Do you have a sense of Pakistani airport security, and how did the other passengers get off of the plane? **********A. I don't think we have those kind of details yet. This airport was one of those that had been looked at, that Americans do use, and this is one that had been looked at by the F.A.A. team last month. But this airport was not placed on a list of airports that were dangerous for Americans. However, we're told that three times in the past 12 months they have been there and the assessment has been the same kind - not to place them on the list.  STATE DEPT. BRIEFING **********At approximately 1 P.M. Eastern daylight time, the auxiliary power unit supplying power to Pan Am Flight 73, which was still on the ground at Karachi airport, ceased to function, plunging the aircraft into darkness. **********Somehow - at this stage we don't know how - shooting occurred and doors on the aircraft opened. Those passengers who could do so fled, and Pakistani security personnel who were waiting nearby secured the plane. The Government of Pakistan acted boldly and decisively, and we applaud its exemplary resolve in doing so. **********Several hijackers have been taken into custody. Obviously, there have been casualties among the passengers. We have no confirmation of numbers, nationalities or any other details at this time. Some of the surviving passengers are in hotels in Karachi; some are being treated in local hospitals. Our details at the moment are at best sketchy. **********However, for those who have reason to believe that a family member who is an American citizen may have been on board, consular officers on the task force will give you what information is available at area (202) 647-6530. **********That's all I have by way of prepared remarks. Jim? Identity of the Hijackers **********Q. You don't know who the hijackers are? **********A. At the moment, we have reports that the hijackers claim to be members of the Arab Liberation Organization. This group is previously unknown to us. **********Q. Do you discount, then, any connection with Libya? **********A. As I said, at this point - I've given you basically what information we have at this point. We have no information right now about any involvement of Libya, or any other country. **********Q. When you talk of reports, the question always comes up, do you mean independent reports or do you have news reports? **********A. In this case, Barry, that question is a bit difficult to answer. What I'm speaking from here is on the basis of all the reports that are coming in to us from a variety of sources, not all of which of course are press. **********Q. What exactly were the hijackers' demands? **********A. Concerning the demands of the hijackers, we don't have any independent information concerning those demands. Role of U.S. Government **********Q. What was the role of the U.S. Government in all this? How closely were we able to monitor it on the scene, and was there any participation by U.S. forces in this? **********A. U.S. Embassy officials were in continuous contact with the Government of Pakistan. Control of the situation at the Karachi airport was maintained by Pakistani authorities throughout. Beyond that, concerning any role of - potential role for U.S. forces, we simply don't comment on that sort of question. **********Q. That's frankly what I wanted to ask you. I wanted to ask you - and perhaps I'll try it anyhow - did this hijacking end before the U.S. could play the sort of role it would have liked to have played, or would have preferred playing? **********A. That's the kind of question I'm obviously not going to answer. **********Q. Did the shooting start because the lights went out and the hijackers were afraid they would lose control anyway, or did they see Pakistani forces and fear that a raid was imminent? **********A. That's the kind of detail that really isn't available to us. **********If trims are needed, delete a COMPLETE question and answer. Do NOT bite from opening statement leding each section.

Slack From Space Shuttle **********President Reagan announced on Friday that the Government would phase out commercial satellite launches by the space shuttles, and he encouraged the private sector to pick up the slack. **********That decision set off a frantic scramble among companies using satellites to find other ways to boost their payloads into space. Until now, the space shuttles offered a cheaper ride than the private sector could offer. Martin Marietta would compete with launching businesses offered by China, Japan and Ariane, the European space consortium. **********Industry analysts said that Martin Marietta's action would likely prompt other large military contractors such as the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the General Dynamics Corporation and a partnership between the Boeing Company and Hughes to follow suit in a new $2 billion market. Launches as Soon as 1989 **********Martin Marietta said it would sell a modified version of the Titan 3 rocket now manufactured for the Air Force at the company's aerospace facilities in Denver. The company said the first commercial payload, probably two 5,500-pound telecommunications satellites, could be launched as soon as 1989, with regularly scheduled launches thereafter. **********''The Titan's ability to launch multiple payloads and its demonstrated reliability, established business base and growth potential assure a strong American presence in the future of space commercialization,'' said Thomas G. Pownall, Martin Marietta's chairman and chief executive. **********Martin Marietta has been making the Titan rockets series since the mid-1960's. The Titans have had 129 successful satellite launches in 134 attempts, the last two tries failed. **********Mr. Koski said that the price of a rocket would be negotiated with each customer. He declined to give a price range. Analysts said that the Titan 3's the Air Force uses cost about $65 million apiece. **********The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had 44 contracts to launch commercial satellites. On Friday, however, the administration said that only 15 satellites would be carried into orbit once the Shuttles resume service in 1988. **********Mr. Koski said that the air-conditioning, heating and stabilizer systems in the satellite bay of the Air Force Titan 3 would be modified to accommodate commercial satellites designed for launch from the Space Shuttles. **********The Titan 3 rockets, which are propelled by liquid and solid fuel, would boost mainly telecommunications satellites 22,300 miles into orbit, where they would usually be parked above the equator just south of the United States. **********Martin Marietta would pay the launching costs from Cape Canaveral, Fla. **********Martin Marietta has Air Force contracts to modify 13 Titan 2 rockets, converted from missiles equipped to launch nuclear warheads. It also has orders for 10 Titan 4 rockets, and is scheduled to deliver the last of 15 Titan 3 rockets to the Air Force next month. **********Industry analysts said Martin Marietta could easily increase rocket production at relatively little cost, and meet the 1989 target launch date. **********''Everything is under way, so now it's a question of cranking up production and finding customers,'' said Christopher Demisch, aerospace analyst at the First Boston Corporation. **********Some obstacles still face Martin Marietta and other competitors in the incipient market.

''It's darn near an acceptable offer,'' said Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the head of the House delegation. ''This is the first indication the conferees are very serious about getting this bill.'' **********Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, said he would make a counteroffer on Wednesday that would modify the Senate proposal ''in very small measure.'' **********The lawmakers are now in their third week of bargaining on the comprehensive legislation, and today's development was the most important movement toward writing a final bill. **********The Senate-passed bill would generate $21 billion less than the existing tax system over the next five years, and House conferees have refused to begin negotiations until the senators devised ways to make up the difference. The package offered by the senators would raise an estimated $30 billion. **********The principal difference between the House and Senate bills is that the Senate measure would be more advantageous to businesses but less favorable to individuals. **********For individuals, the most consequential proposal made by the senators today would allow deductions for many items listed on tax forms as miscellaneous deductions, such as union dues and equipment used on the job, if they totaled more than 2 percent of a taxpayer's income. **********In the bill as it passed the Senate, all such deductions would be repealed. Under the proposal, deductions would be completely disallowed for tax preparation fees, investment advisers' fees, home office expenses, subscriptions to periodicals and rentals of safe deposit boxes. **********The senators discussed but did not formally propose various ways of allowing partial deductions for contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts. The Senate bill would disallow deductions for contributions to I.R.A.'s by taxpayers covered by company pension plans. The House measure would retain the deductions. **********One idea the senators considered was to allow a $1,000 deduction, compared with $2,000 under the current law, for taxpayers with incomes below a certain level, perhaps $30,000 or even $50,000 a year. **********The senators also proposed raising the earned income credit allowed low-income workers and a somewhat larger standard deduction for the elderly and the blind. **********The most important business tax increases proposed by the Senate conferees would limit the depreciation deductions that corporations could take, raise the taxes on banks and other financial institutions by more than $4 billion over the next five years and require companies to pay taxes on their capital gains at the same rate they pay on other income. Rejected by Representatives **********The senators made a previous offer last Saturday. But a large part of it, including proposals to reduce the amount taxpayers could contribute to 401(k) retirement plans and to limit deductions for mortgage interest payments in certain circumstances, was rejected out of hand by the House conferees. **********Many items on the new list seem almost certain to become part of the final legislation. **********For example, the proposals made by the senators to deny two important deductions now taken by banks are identical to provisions in the House bill. One would disallow deductions by large financial institutions for the funds they must hold in reserve to cover bad debts. The other would deny deductions for interest payments on money borrowed by financial institutions to buy tax-exempt bonds. **********Many banks currently are able to reduce the taxes they owe to negligible amounts because they make such extensive use of those two deductions. Shift on Depreciation **********The most striking difference between the Senate and House bills on the business side is the much more generous treatment in the Senate bill of depreciation deductions for the purchase of plants and equipment. The senators agreed today to somewhat less favorable rules. For example, cars and light trucks, under the proposal, would be written off over five years instead of three, the same as in the House bill. **********The full conference committee of 11 senators and 11 House conferees never met as a body today. First, the senators caucused in private to prepare their proposal. Next, Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who heads the Senate delegation, met with Mr. Rostenkowski and presented him with the offer. Then Mr. Rostenkowski met with the House Democratic conferees, and finally House Republican conferees joined the session. **********Some of the senators said they were troubled by the concessions they made today, afraid that the additional business taxes might be damaging to the economy.

''We are not fighting for our land. I would bleed for Vietnam, but I did not want to die for someone else's country.'' **********Mr. Hieu said he had just completed secondary school in 1979 when Hanoi, which was fighting in Cambodia and, on its northern border, against a Chinese invasion, began a major conscription drive.

They are all young, strong, and single.'' **********The former soldiers - living among more than 7,300 boat people also awaiting new homes - say others who fled did not make it. **********''We experienced many dangers coming to Thailand,'' said Mr. Tao, who defected with five other soldiers.

Instead, he was sent for political re-education and assigned to hard-labor projects in an effort to dissuade him from an academic career. He said he went on studying anyway, by any means he could.

These included unfavorable reactions from some of its largest customers. **********Quotron, a Los Angeles-based provider of financial information whose 80,000 terminals are used by stockbrokers and institutional investors worldwide, said its board would continue to evaluate the bid in collaboration with its Wall Street adviser, Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********But in a statement issued after two days of deliberations, Milton E. Mohr, Quotron's chairman and chief executive, said a ''developing consensus'' of the Quotron board was that the Citicorp bid, made March 18, was ''not adequate.'' No Sign of Higher Bid **********The Citicorp offer was for Quotron's almost 35 million outstanding shares, or about $680 million. Mr. Mohr said Citicorp had not indicated that it would raise its bid, and he said he had not heard from Citicorp since the offer was made. Citicorp said it would not comment. **********Mr. Mohr said Quotron's six directors had considered ''a number of possible future courses of action for the company,'' including remaining independent or combining with another organization. His statement went no further. **********In a telephone interview afterward, however, Mr. Mohr said the board had a number of concerns about the Citicorp bid unrelated to price. **********In particular, he said there was concern that Quotron, if it merged with Citicorp, might not be able to proceed with a business venture involving Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Shearson, a Citicorp competitor in certain markets, has reportedly expressed concern in recent days that some of its business plans might become known to Citicorp if Quotron combined with the bank holding company. **********Beyond that, Mr. Mohr said, it was not clear that Citicorp could improve Quotron's information services. A merger would need the Federal Reserve Board's approval, he said. **********Some Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, have suggested that the Fed might restrict Citicorp's supplying of financial data to Quotron given the laws limiting the activities of bank holding companies. Quotron also has a complex noncompete contract with Telerate Inc., another provider of financial information, that could make it legally difficult for Citicorp to feed data to Quotron. And Merrill Lynch & Company, Quotron's biggest customer and another Citicorp competitor, might frown upon a Citicorp-Quotron merger. **********''That is certainly be one of the elements that had to be considered,'' Mr. Mohr said. The Quotron response caught analysts by surprise. Many of them had considered the offer generous in light of the intense competition taking shape in the information industry. Additionally, few expect another bidder to emerge for the company. **********What is more, Quotron had been soliciting offers. According to Louis M. Brizzolara, an analyst with Rowe & Pitman of San Francisco, Quotron hired Goldman, Sachs last year to consider alternatives for the company's future, including a merger."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/11/business/company-news-gallo-drops-time-inc-ads.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gallo Drops Time Inc.

The plan, which involved sweeping economic changes, a wage-price freeze and a new currency, the cruzado, has virtually eliminated inflation without throwing Brazil into recession. **********Mr. Funaro said that ''two or three banks have already asked us to submit proposals to go back into the market'' for funds. He declined to identify the banks. Agreement With Assessment **********Commercial bankers, who like Mr. Funaro are in Washington for the joint annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, said they agreed with the Brazilian minister's assessment about voluntary lending. **********William R. Rhodes, chairman of Citicorp's restructuring committee and co-chairman of the bank advisory group for Brazil, said, ''Not only is voluntary lending possible for Brazil, but I think it will happen.'' **********''It could be possible,'' said Alfred Herrhausen, co-chairman of the Deutsche Bank, which has had a banking relationship with Brazil since the 19th century. A senior Treasury official who asked not to be identified, said, ''We're impressed with the progress they're making,'' but added as a note of caution, ''we're concerned about the sustainability of their economic progress.'' Engine for Latin America **********In the breakfast session, Mr. Funaro contended that his country, with its huge market of 135 million people, had become the engine of growth for Latin America. ''We are importing from Argentina, from Uruguay, from many countries,'' he said. ''If Brazil could free itself from the crisis, it would help many countries in Latin America to grow more.'' **********Inter-American Development Bank figures show Latin American growth of 3.5 percent last year. Brazil's output was up 8 percent, and is expected to be about the same this year. Excluding Brazil, Latin America's growth last year was only 1 percent. **********Brazil, which owes $105 billion to international creditors, is the eighth largest free-market economy. In the last three years it has accumulated trade surpluses of around $12 billion annually, which have been used chiefly to pay bank interest. **********It is hoping to conclude later this year a multiyear rescheduling, both with some 700 creditor banks and the so-called Paris Club, an informal association of creditor governments of the industrial countries, such as the United States Export-Import Bank. An Ex-Im Bank spokesman said Brazil owed it $300 million. Accord With Fund Required **********Banks are now being put under pressure by the International Monetary Fund to lend to most third world debtor countries. The fund uses its influence, however, only after the countries have signed an I.M.F. agreement, which requires an austerity program. Brazil has refused to sign an agreement. Yet last year its domestic program won the fund's seal of approval, and, according to Mr. Funaro, is expected to win endorsement this year as well. **********An I.M.F. team recently visited Brazil. Mr. Funaro said that the fund's managing director, Jacques de Larosiere, told him the fund's report on Brazil would probably be ready for submission to the fund's board in 30 to 60 days. ''We expect it will be favorable,'' said Mr. Funaro. A fund spokesman declined to comment. **********One possible obstacle to voluntary lending is a fixed rule of the Paris Club, the government creditors, that there be an I.M.F. program or something very much like it in place before it agrees to a rescheduling. But both Mr. Funaro and bankers interviewed here today suggested that the Paris Club might show some flexibility. **********Added R. T. McNamar, a former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and now a Washington-based merchant banker, ''If the Brazilians are doing 90 percent of what they would be doing anyway in a fund program, there should be no problem. Otherwise, it would be the triumph of form over substance.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/10/business/advertising-glenpatrick-water.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 49, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Glenpatrick Water", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Glenpatrick Water", "body_text": " **********Perrier, watch out.

But both of these approaches were unacceptable because they would violate the Congressional ban on aid to the rebels. **********Mr. Kimche was then said to have suggested a third option, namely to increase the price of the weapons being sold to Iran and to send the proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. North Has Kept Silent Mr. North has not commented on any aspect of the Iran affair since his interview with the Attorney General. He has refused to testify before Congress, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. **********In his news conference on Nov. 25, Mr. Meese surprised the Israeli Government when he publicly asserted that ''representatives of Israel'' had been involved in the diversion. Describing the diversion of money to the Nicaraguan rebels, he said: **********''Bank accounts were established, as best we know, by representatives of the forces in Central America. And this information was provided to representatives of the Israeli Government - or representatives of Israel, I should say - and then these funds were put into the accounts.'' **********Later in the news conference, Mr. Meese was questioned again about the purported Israeli role and said, ''We don't know all the facts.'' This, he said, was ''why I am being very careful to say that, as best we know, they were representatives of Israel. **********''Whether they were specifically authorized by the Government is one of the things I assume we will find out,'' he added.

As various stories about Colonel North have appeared in recent weeks, people inside and outside the Government have asserted that he embellished aspects of his personal statements. **********Mr. Kimche said today that he first heard about the diversion of money when he read about it in a newspaper. **********After reviewing his notes and calendars, Mr. Kimche said that he had met Colonel North twice, the first time in Washington in November 1985, when the subject of the conversation was Robert C. McFarlane Jr., who was then considering resigning as national security adviser to the President. The second meeting with Colonel North occurred in December 1985 in London, when the arms sale to Iran was being discussed with Iranian representatives, Mr. Kimche said. Kimche Recalls Meetings **********''I met him for the first time in Washington on Nov. 8, 1985 when I was introduced to him by another American official,'' the Israeli recalled in the interview. **********''The three of us had lunch very near to the White House. This lunch was devoted to North's explaining to me that, in his opinion, Bud McFarlane was faltering in his willingness to remain in his job and considering resignation. They asked if I would try to reinforce him. At no time during the lunch was there any discussion about diverting funds to the contras. **********''We walked from the restaurant to the White House, about five minutes, and there I met with McFarlane. **********''I don't remember any longer if the other man at the lunch was with us during the walk. But in any event, it was only five minutes, and North and I never discussed aiding the contras during that time. **********''The second and last time I met him was when he appeared in London with McFarlane at a meeting with the Iranians sometime between Dec. 6 and Dec, 8, 1985. I don't remember the exact date. **********''We met in a large group and again there was absolutely no discussion of aiding the contras betwen North and myself or anyone else that I know of. Each time I met him, it was with a large group of people and never on a one-to-one basis.'' A Possible Motive Suggested **********Asked whether Colonel North might be lying and blaming him to save himself, Mr. Kimche said: ''That is exactly what I think is happening.'' **********One day after the diversion of funds to the contras was disclosed by Mr. Meese, the Israeli Government issued a statement that said: **********''The funds did not pass through Israel. The Government of Israel was surprised to learn that supposedly a portion of the funds was transferred to the contras. If such a transaction took place, it had nothing to do with Israel and the Government of Israel had no knowledge of it. Israel did not serve and would not have served as a channel for such a transaction.'' **********Israeli Government officials have voiced fear that the entire affair involving the secret arms sale to Iran and the diversion of funds to the Nicaraguan rebels might damage relations with the Reagan Administration and with Congress. **********It was not clear when Mr. North actually met with the Israeli official who he said suggested the diversion of money. **********By April 1986, Colonel North is believed to have been the author of a draft national security directive suggesting the need to raise $12 million in ''bridge money'' for the contras from the Iran arms sales. The memorandum was placed in the main file system of the National Security Council staff, and was found by Assistant Attorney General Bradford Reynolds when Mr. Meese began his investigation of the matter on the weekend of Nov. 23. Israeli Argued for Resumption **********In recent weeks, Government officials have provided new details about Israel's part in continuing the arms sales to Iran. The officials said, for instance, that Amiram Nir, the Prime Minister's adviser on terrorism, had played a crucial role in resuming the arms shipments after they were cut off on Dec. 6, 1985. **********Mr. Nir came to Washington later that month and said that Israel had changed the Government officials and intermediaries who had worked on the sales through 1985. Also, he is said to have told William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, that additional arms shipments would free the American hostages in Lebanon. **********Government officials who have reviewed the arms sales to Iran said this argument convinced President Reagan to resume arms shipments. **********The officials said the shipments had been suspended more because of unhappiness with the logistics provided by Israel than because of any deep-seated opposition to the idea. On Jan. 17, 1986, President Reagan signed an order authorizing direct American participation in the shipments, which had previously been sent by Israel through Israeli middlemen."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/07/business/about-real-estate-woodside-plant-turned-into-condominiums-units.html": {"writer_name": "Dee Wedemeyer", "pub_date": "1986-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 847, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WOODSIDE PLANT TURNED INTO CONDOMINIUMS UNITS", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE; WOODSIDE PLANT TURNED INTO CONDOMINIUMS UNITS", "body_text": " **********Alex Blau does not own property in Manhattan but the higher that prices rise for co-ops and condominiums in Manhattan, the happier he is. Mr. Blau builds for people priced out of the Manhattan market. **********''Hopefully the young people will discover us,'' Mr. Blau said. **********He is one of the developers of Queens Landmark, a 63-unit building at 62-10 Woodside Avenue, which he believes is the only industrial-to-condominium renovation in Woodside. **********The condominium units sell for an average of $180 a square foot - ranging from $360,000 for a 1,795-square-foot penthouse with terrace to $117,000 for an angular, 647-square-foot one-bedroom unit on the first floor. To some Woodsiders, the prices sound alarmingly high, but in Manhattan, the price of most new condominiums begins at $300 a square foot. **********''Woodside is a working-class community and luxury co-ops are not really consistent,'' said Elenor Denker, the director of Woodside on the Move, a nonprofit community development organization, and chairman of the housing committee for Community Board 2. **********Woodside, which is surrounded by Elmhurst, Sunnyside, Astoria and Maspeth, was for many years populated by people predominantly of Irish and Italian heritage. The 1980 census showed a change, with 35 percent of the residents of Hispanic or Asian descent and 1 percent black. The housing stock is mostly one- and two-family pre-World War II units with small garden plots in front and attached garages. **********Dr. Denker said 24-hour doormen and powder rooms, which are part of the Queens Landmark amenities, are not common in Woodside. She said there was concern, particularly among renters, that the condominium would push prices beyond what children growing up in Woodside would be able to afford. **********But prices have already risen there and are continuing to rise, according to Charles Frazer, a salesman at Century 21 Frazer Real Estate. He said many people in the community may not know what is happening to housing prices. **********''In 1978 we had a three-family house that sold for $84,000; it sold in the fall of 1985 for $285,000,'' Mr. Frazer said. ''Over the last year things have gotten expensive out here. It's the classic case of supply and demand. When you start looking for a co-op in Manhattan for $250,000 and you can buy a whole house for that in Woodside, wouldn't you buy the house?'' **********He said recent sales in Woodside include $180,000 for a one-family house with three bedrooms, dining room, basement, driveway, garage and two baths. A one-family, three-bedroom house three blocks from Queens Landmark sold for $200,000. One problem, he said, is that there is little for sale. **********The condominium is one block south and in sight of the Long Island Rail Road tracks and the No. 7 subway line. To the rear is the condominium's 58-space parking lot. Some spaces are included in the purchase price of apartments, others can be purchased for $9,000. **********The building was once the site of a Bulova Watch Company plant. An exterior clock has been removed and so has a skywalk linking the plant to an adjoining building. The mezzanine and first floors had 20-foot heights and were turned into duplexes with nine-foot ceilings, and a fifth story, previously a mechanical floor, was expanded. The architect was Ralph Wuest of Wuest & Bailey, an Astoria firm. **********Mr. Blau and Paul Perlmutter purchased the building in January 1981. Originally, they hoped to sell at $120 to $130 a foot, but costs increased. ''We found 12-to-14-inch ledges of concrete we had to drill through,'' Mr. Perlmutter said. ''It's built like a fortress.'' **********The parking lot cost another $300,000, he said, adding: ''But we decided parking was important. A spa you can always find, but parking you don't find.'' **********Sales began last fall. Eleven units are in contract, with five of the buyers from Queens, six from Manhattan; seven others have signed binders. Prices were lowered about 10 percent in December. **********Mr. Perlmutter is a watch importer who was born in Rumania and immigrated to the United States in 1957 after living in Panama and Canada. Mr. Blau, who was born in Czechoslovakia and emigrated to Israel before moving to Queens in 1961, is the owner of A & G Blau Decorators, which has done upholstery and drapery work for hotels. **********They began developing real estate in Queens with a renovation of an apartment building in 1978 and then went on to build three-family houses. On this project, Mr. Blau is in charge of construction and design, including the lobby's upholstered walls and the model apartments. Mr. Perlmutter is the sponsor. **********There are 46 one-bedroom units, some of which are triplexes ranging in price from $117,000 to $225,000; 11 two-bedroom units from $220,000 to $250,000, eight of which are duplexes; six five- or six-room apartments ranging from $265,000 to $360,000 for the penthouse, which has already been sold.

Kenneth S. Miller and Russell J.

She immediately vowed to resume her drive to overthrow the Government of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. **********Speaking at her family home in the Karachi suburbs, the same place where the police took her into custody last month, Miss Bhutto said also the anti-Government movement would have to ''revise our strategy'' and determine a more effective way to proceed in its challenge to General Zia. **********Miss Bhutto said her arrest - one of 2,000 in a week - and the subsequent clashes between protesters and the police in which more than 25 people were killed showed that both General Zia and Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo were ''determined to cling to power at any cost.'' **********'Kill and Kill and Kill' **********''This regime is prepared to kill and kill and kill,'' she said. ''I would lay the blame for every single drop of violence and damage to property solely on the shoulders of this regime.'' **********The violence after the arrests subsided after a week. Miss Bhutto said tonight that her supporters, in protesting the arrests, remained peaceful throughout but that the killings were incited by agents provocateurs from the Government. **********Smiling broadly, Miss Bhutto was relaxed and talkative as she sat on a living-room couch under a huge painting of her father, former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was overthrown by General Zia in 1977 and hanged in 1979 on a disputed murder charge. She wore a white tunic and trousers and was snacking on lotus flower seeds. **********Miss Bhutto said she had been told that her release came with a blanket lifting of the detention orders of hundreds of other political leaders who were seized on Aug. 13 and 14 on charges of violating a briefly imposed ban on rallies and street processions. It could not be determined late tonight how many of the other dissidents had been set free. Most Got 30-Day Term **********The Government said about 2,000 political dissidents were arrested in the crackdown last month, most of them for a term of no more than 30 days. Miss Bhutto's release was therefore expected around this time, especially after some publicity was given here to an interview with The New York Times in which General Zia said he expected her to be released before the end of her 30-day term. **********The immediate impetus for her release appeared to be a judge's decision last week that allowed her to make a personal appeal in Karachi High Court challenging the legality of her arrest. The court appearance was scheduled for Tuesday. **********Associates of Miss Bhutto suggested that the Government had decided to release her today so she would not receive international attention in her court challenge from the press gathered here to cover the hijacking of a Pan American World Airways jumbo jet on Friday. **********News of the hijacking subsided today, and dozens of journalists from around the world flocked to the colonial-style red sandstone courthouse to obtain passes for Miss Bhutto's hearing. Besieged Pakistani officials complained that the courtroom could not accommodate all of them. Says Conditions Weren't Harsh **********Miss Bhutto said her imprisonment just outside of Karachi was not especially harsh compared with the solitary confinement and other imprisonments she has undergone between 1981 and 1984. She had no radio and television but some newspapers, she said. She also had no access to lawyers for the first two weeks. **********''Basically, I was just left to myself,'' she said. ''Obviously, prison isn't a bed of roses, and it was pretty uncomfortable being there. When you're in detention each day seems like a month.'' **********Many of her comments were directed at questions about what was apparently the failure of her party to organize an effective, sustained protest after her arrest. Miss Bhutto said the Pakistan People's Party, which she serves as chairman, was not fully prepared when the arrests came. Nor was it prepared, she said, to cope with the willingness of the Government to shoot at protesters in incidents that she said claimed 40 lives. **********Miss Bhutto maintained that all the killings occurred because the police fired unprovoked. Witnesses, however, said many shootings occurred as protesters stormed, ransacked and burned police stations, banks, railway stations and prisons, mostly in southeastern Sind Province, and in some cases fired shots themselves. Opposition Had Set Deadline **********Before the arrests, Miss Bhutto's organization and the other anti-Zia political parties set a Sept. 20 deadline, saying they would begin a sweeping agitation on that date if General Zia did not schedule new elections this fall. Politicians agreed this month that the speed with which the Government quelled the disorders showed that their organization was weaker than claimed. **********Tonight, Miss Bhutto, 33 years old, acknowledged that her supporters were only in ''a half state of preparation'' when the crackdown occurred, but she said they would have been ready by Sept. 20. She suggested the Government deliberately pre-empted the deadline to provoke her organization into acting before it was ready. **********''There's no use crying over spilled milk,'' she said. ''Unfortunately, on the 14th, the way they loosed a reign of terror just changed everything. I think we did underestimate the extent of the repression that they would go to. Believe me, I never thought they would kill 40 people who were just holding a rally.'' Vows to Continue Protest **********Miss Bhutto said her party would continue to ''exercise its constitutional rights'' and hold processions and demonstrations even if the Government outlawed them. She said that this might lead to new repression and violence but that the Government could not carry on this way indefinitely. Eventually, she said, the Government will see the necessity of resolving the confrontation with ''a political settlement'' that will require elections. **********As for the Government's actions, Miss Bhutto said: ''We have come to terms with that. We have to outplay them. We have to outsmart them. We have to outmanipulate them.'' **********She said she would hold a meeting with other politicians in the coming days to determine whether the Sept. 20 deadline was still pertinent and how to revive the anti-Zia drive. As of tonight, she said, she still needs to learn what is happening, and she joked that although many people regarded her as ''a superwoman'' who ''knows everything that is going on,'' she is ''not a superwoman'' and will need to consult."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/08/business/american-can-set-to-sell-unit-stake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Can Set To Sell Unit Stake", "print_headline": "American Can Set To Sell Unit Stake", "body_text": " **********The American Can Company said it plans to sell a 15 percent interest in its American Capital Management and Research subsidiary to the public at between $20 and $23 a share. **********The Greenwich, Conn., concern, which has over the past several years significantly restructured its operations, said the sale of the stake in the mutual funds management unit would result in a gain to the parent company of between $40 million and $47 million. **********American Capital had total assets of $10.6 billion at the end of 1985.

But some sponsors - including Senators Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, and Rudy Boschwitz, Republican of Minnesota - are considering not calling for a vote after their amendments are debated for fear of suffering a major defeat and spoiling any chance for change in later negotiations with the House of Representatives. **********''At this point, it looks pretty clear that virtually no amendment is going to succeed on the floor,'' said Jonathan W. Fleming, an aide to Senator Cranston who is working on a Cranston-Boschwitz amendment to preserve preferential treatment for capital gains. **********''I think it will be tough to get anything passed,'' said Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine and a member of the Finance Committee. Nevertheless he said he would ask for a vote on his amendment that would raise the top rate to 35 percent and provide greater tax relief to middle- and lower-income workers and completely restore the deduction for Individual Retirement Accounts. **********Senate Republican leaders, fearing that major changes could unravel the entire tax package, are working to enlarge a coalition of senators to vote against any amendments. **********Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, said last Thursday that he had anti-amendment pledges from 31 senators. The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, warned that any amendment offered would fall short of votes. **********The Reagan Administration has endorsed this strategy of moving the committee bill intact through the Senate as a way to preserve the plan's top tax rates of 27 percent for individuals and 33 percent for corporations. **********President Reagan, who has made tax revision his No. 1 domestic legislative priority, has invited all 100 senators to the White House for breakfast on Thursday to urge them to pass the Finance Committee's version intact and forgo any changes until the House-Senate conference. **********As a result, lobbyists have found that some senators who are normally sympathetic to their causes are unwilling to sponsor amendments in the face of such opposition. **********''It makes it a little difficult to try to find a sponsor or even firm up people who said they were interested,'' said Deborah Shannon, legislative liaison director for the National Multi-Housing Council, a real estate trade group. ''I am less than optimistic about what we can accomplish on the Senate floor. '' **********Senator Dole was originally one of the senators thinking about sponsoring an amendment to ease the phase-in of restrictions on real estate and other tax shelters. But he has since joined Senator Packwood in vowing to help block any amendments. **********Another reason for modest expectations among lobbyists is the debut this week of live television coverage of the Senate. They expect senators to be reluctant to argue strongly for certain changes - such as special corporate breaks - in front of a TV audience. **********Still another problem encountered by lobbyists seeking changes is finding ways to replace the lost revenue that their amendments would cause. The prevailing view is that any amendment offered that is not ''revenue-neutral'' would be easily beaten. **********As a result, many senators and lobbyists are resigned to the prospect that any major changes would have to come from the House-Senate conference, where tax-writers would resolve differences between the two bills. **********But they are also holding open the possibility that if one major amendment passes, the dam could break. Senate leaders are particularly concerned about amendments to restore the deductions for I.R.A.'s, which have considerable support.

Payment for the new issues was due yesterday, and dealers said that activity in the market for repurchase agreements suggested there was no burdensome glut of the new issues. **********With yesterday's gains of nearly a half-point, the new 7 1/2 percent Treasury bonds due in 2016 were offered at 100 9/32 to yield 7.48 percent, up from 99 17/32 at the auction, while the 7 1/4 percent notes due in 1996 were at 100 11/32 to yield 7.20 percent, up from 100. The new 6 3/8 percent notes due in three years were offered at 99 7/8 to yield 6.42 percent, up 1/8 point on the day and about equal to the auction average. **********Analysts said the improvement in prices reflected widespread expectations that the nation's sluggish economic growth will eventually result in lower interest rates. **********''The markets are no longer expecting another discount rate cut in 1986, but one is still likely after the turn of the year,'' analysts at Data Resources said. While the Fed may not move aggressively for lower rates, weak credit demands after the first of the year might foster lower rates, the analysts said. Gold's Fall Aids Prices **********Traders also said that prices of long-term Treasury issues were helped by a $9.40 drop in gold, to $388.60 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Some traders use gold prices as a proxy for inflationary expectations and associate lower gold prices with higher bond prices. **********Payment for the new Treasury issues helped keep the overnight rate for Federal funds above 6 percent, despite the Federal Reserve's move to supply reserves temporarily to the banking system through purchases of securities. **********Rates at the regular weekly auction of Treasury bills were slightly lower than a week ago. The new three-month issue averaged 5.39 percent, down from 5.41 percent, while the six-month issue was at 5.44 percent, down from 5.54 percent. **********The trend toward higher prices in the Treasury market was also evident in the tax-exempt, corporate and mortgage markets, securities dealers said. Tax Law Curbs a Security **********New tax-exempt financings included an issue of pollution control revenue bonds, a type of security that is destined to become scarce because it is no longer allowed under the new tax bill. The $50 million issue, offered by the Brazos River Authority on behalf of the Houston Lighting and Power Company through underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody & Company, is allowed under special transition rules in the tax law. **********Executives at Kidder, which tentatively offered the new 7 7/8 percent bonds due in 2018 at 100, said sales were good to tax-exempt bond mutual funds and life insurance companies. Earlier this year, tax-exempt bond mutual funds were avoiding new issues, such as the Brazos River offering, which are subject to the alternative minimum tax on individuals. **********Because interest on the bonds may be taxable for some individuals, and because the weak Texas economy deters some investors, analysts estimated that the issue's yield was about four-tenths of a percentage point higher than would have otherwise been required. Bond ratings of A-2 from Moody's and A- from Standard & Poor's are expected. **********Elsewhere in the tax-exempt market, a $350 million refunding bond issue of the Southern California Public Power Authority was offered through Salomon Brothers. The long-term bonds were tentatively priced with a yield of 7.187 percent for the 2015 maturity and 7.071 percent for the 2006 issue. Serial bond yields ranged from 4.40 percent for bonds due in 1988 to 5.20 percent in 1991, 6.20 percent in 1996 and 6.80 percent in 2001. The agency also offered 5 3/4 percent bonds due in 2017 at a discount to yield 7 percent. **********Yesterday's largest new corporate issue was a $250 million issue of 30-year sinking-fund debentures for the Dayton Hudson Corporation. A Goldman, Sachs group offered the 9 1/4 percent issue at 99 1/2 to yield 9.229 percent, or about 1.6 percentage points more than the Treasury's 9 1/4 percent bonds due in 2016.

It is 300 bequerals per kilogram of meat, while most of the rest of Europe has an easier limit of 600, and the United States sets 1,500, according to Swedish scientists. **********The confusion has only sharpened the Sames' anxiety about the future of their herds and the future of their own children who feed off the herds. #2,000 Years of History After 2,000 years of prevailing alongside the reindeer against some of nature's harshest challenges, the Sames are gravely wondering whether they can once more adapt to the shifting circumstances of life. They long ago mastered the northern snow, for which their language has 80 different words for its subtleties. **********And they will traverse the new land of radiation if history be the guide, for Tacitus first wrote of them in 98 A.D., admiring their strength as nomadic hunters and fishermen. **********Sames say the new threat comes as a blow to their pride, for they are seeing all their careful herding effort produce contaminated meat that must be dyed blue to discourage human consumption. In recent years, the Sames, well adapted to modern life, had developed cooperatives to build a lucrative gourmet food export business. **********This will continue to some degree, but sale of the contaminated meat will have to prop up the reindeer economy and culture through an indefinite future of being scrutinized for radiation effects, both deer and herders. **********''Who would have thought nature could be so wounded in such a remote place?'' asked Mr. Doj, a Same journalist who discovered in the mountain roundup that his own herd was too contaminated for human consumption. #50 Percent Above Limit ''I am sick,'' he said, planning to journey to buy additional meat in one of the cleaner regions and vowing to take extra aim in the annual elk hunt now starting. Unfortunately, 50 percent of the first elk slain have registered above the 300 limit, according to Prof. Hans Svensson of the University of Umea, one of those who think the radiation standards may be unrealistic. **********Upland deer owners in contaminated areas have been cautioned against consuming too much local fish and berries, as well as the deer meat that is the main daily protein food for many of them. **********''I'll eat what I please - I'm 67 years old - but how will the little grandchildren be affected?'' asked Per-Folke Persson, who has been herding for 50 years. Government specialists say genetic risks seem minimal, but Sames already are traveling to safer grounds to secure cleaner meat for the children. **********Significant parts of the deer herds, close to half by some estimates, will remain contaminated for five years and longer, according to Government technicians. Cultural Effects Feared **********Some specialists are estimating the health and ecological problems will eventually prove limited and manageable. But the Same people are worried that their way of life is slipping into an irradiated limbo where the worst residue, cesium 137, will still be at half strength 30 years from now, while the affected lichen will linger for a decade. **********''I'm not that concerned about the health problem because so much attention is being paid to it,'' said Gunnar Bengtsson, a scientist with the Swedish National Institute of Radiation Protection. ''My concern is the cultural aspect. This is a heavy blow to a very unique culture that revolves around the reindeer, and the psychological problems could be considerable.'' **********In place of the mass government slaughter that herders said would have traumatized their society, the more traditional herd-winnowing and selective killing has now begun in the skilled hands of the Sames. **********The new generation of herders like Mr. Johansson were using helicopters, motorcycles and radio telephones to rout the reindeer down to the autumn corrals from the high ground. **********Up there, the rain-sopped renlav lichen savored by the deer has been a principal food all summer, a diabolically spongy conduit for the cesium fallout from Chernobyl. **********As the Same herders lassoed and slaughtered some of the older and weaker deer, each carcass was numbered for identification and a meat sample was taken for laboratory analysis. Herding 500,000 Reindeer **********Anxiety was clear in herding communities across Lapland as Same leaders awaited the radiation readings from the scientists. The herders represent less than 10 percent of the estimated 70,000 Sames, but they give the culture its definition as well as traditional nourishment in herding the land's 500,000 reindeer. **********This month, as the deer darted down through the shadowy glens of the mountains, the herders had countless as yet unanswered questions for Government officials, particularly whether aid might extend to paying for safer alternative diets for both humans and deer this winter. **********''In a way they are getting too much data, everything is upsetting,'' said Jorgen Bohlin, a lawyer who represents the Swedish Council of Sames. He insists the Sames' well-proven power to survive will again prevail. **********''But you must imagine what it is like now with all these doubts, when before you would just step outside your doorstep and take what you need for the table,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/30/business/personal-finance-splitting-the-assets-fairly-in-divorce.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Rankin", "pub_date": "1986-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1098, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPLITTING THE ASSETS FAIRLY IN DIVORCE", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; SPLITTING THE ASSETS FAIRLY IN DIVORCE", "body_text": " **********THE advent of no-fault laws has transformed the American way of divorce. In the old days, couples who wished to part had to prove that one of them had ''sinned,'' and usually the sinner paid. **********But no-fault divorce, which was designed to eliminate much of the acrimony and sham testimony that once took place in court, changed the rules. The divorce process no longer focuses on ''who did what'' so much as ''who gets what.'' Virtually every state, including New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, has adopted some form of equitable distribution law. These statutes are based on the premise that marriage is an economic partnership, and that property acquired during a marriage should be divided in a way that recognizes the contributions of both parties - homemaking services, for example, as well as monetary support. **********In addition, the courts have gradually broadened the definition of what constitutes marital property. Now, the value of one spouse's right to a future pension is routinely added to other assets when calculating the size of the marital kitty. A closely held business operated by one partner is also considered marital property; professional licenses, too, are coming within the net. **********Just recently, a landmark decision by the New York State Court of Appeals said that a medical license earned by Dr. Michael O'Brien during the nine years he was married constituted marital property. As her share, Loretta O'Brien was awarded $188,800, representing 40 percent of the present value of his future medical earnings. (The case has been returned to an intermediate appellate court to determine what factors the trial judge considered in arriving at the 40 percent allocation.) The decision ''breaks new ground,'' in defining what is marital property, said Albert J. Emanuelli, the White Plains, attorney who represented Mrs. O'Brien. Her husband sued for divorce two months after he received his medical license, and ''all there was to divide was the sheepskin,'' Mr. Emanuelli said. **********Women rarely get half the marital assets at divorce. ''In most cases being decided today, 30 to 40 percent of the assets are going to the wife,'' said Bernard Rothman, a matrimonial attorney in the New York firm of Finkelstein, Bruckman, Wohl & Rothman. Still, he says, that is an improvement. Soon after the state's equitable distribution law was enacted in 1980, the woman's share was ''probably 20 to 30 percent.'' **********In many states, including New York, the concept of long-term alimony has almost completely gone by the boards, except for marriages of two decades or more in which one spouse has no employment skills, or is physically or mentally unable to enter the work force. Instead, courts provide dependent spouses with short-term maintenance payments that rarely last longer than five years. **********Most matrimonial attorneys agree that the key to obtaining a fair financial settlement upon divorce is a thorough review of all the assets acquired by a couple, both jointly and individually, during the marriage. Typically, information about assets such as houses, cars, securities and cash, is obtained during pretrial proceedings, when attorneys attempt to find out as much as they can about the financial situation of the other spouse. **********The interests of husband and wife are often at odds in this process. And the wife can be at a disadvantage if she has little knowledge about her husband's business activities or personal holdings. ''Usually, the man tries to hide assets, and the wife tries to ferret them out,'' says Doris Jonas Freed, a New York attorney who has written several books on family law. But, she adds, men typically ''conceal rather than lie.'' **********In such cases, an accountant or other financial expert can be enormously helpful. If, for example, the husband operates his own business, the accountant can help determine its value and give a knowledgeable opinion about whether the husband is accurately reflecting his income from the enterprise. Similarly, a pension actuary can help to calculate the value, in today's dollars, of a company pension that may not be paid out to the worker-spouse for another 10 or 15 years. Although the cost of retaining such experts may amount to $1,000 or more up front, their fees may be well worth it in the long term, if their contributions enable an attorney to reach a fair settlement for the client. IN a landmark study of how California couples have fared in the 16 years since no-fault divorce took effect there, Lenore J. Weitzman, a professor of sociology at Stanford University, concludes that women are the clear economic losers. **********The results of her research, contained in a recently published book, ''The Divorce Revolution'' (Free Press; $19.95), show that on average during the first year after divorce, women living with their minor children experienced a decline of 73 percent in their standard of living, while men experienced a 42 percent rise. She cites two major reasons for this: First is the forced sale of the family home, a step taken if the judge determined that it was the only way to satisfy the law's requirement that a couple's property be split 50-50. Mothers with young children and elderly homemakers were often evicted, without being awarded enough money to pur-chase alternate housing. The second factor was the substitution of short-term maintenance for long-term alimony, in the mistaken belief that women could quickly enter the labor force and become the economic equals of men. Inadequate child-support awards, and even less adequate enforcement of those awards, also played a role. **********The result, writes Miss Weitzman, has been the ''systematic impoverishment'' of divorced women and their children. ''They have become the new poor,'' she maintains. **********But her critics say Miss Weitzman's findings may not be valid for the rest of the country. ''Not all states are like California, far from it,'' said Mrs. Freed. And California has since modified its law. **********Regardless of what laws govern an actual divorce, it is likely that neither side will be completely satisfied with the outcome. The reason: There is rarely enough money to go around. **********''Unfortunately, the reality in 90 percent of the cases I see is that both parties are living up to every dollar they make, plus 10 percent,'' says Timothy J. Brennan, a matrimonial attorney from Mount Kisco, N.Y. ''As long as the family is intact, they can continue to stretch.'' But if the couple breaks up, the same amount of dollars must now support two households and ''generally, everybody's got to downscale.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/02/world/nuclear-disaster-signs-diminished-danger-duel-wits-russian-faces-congress.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 730, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DUEL OF WITS: A RUSSIAN FACES CONGRESS", "print_headline": "NUCLEAR DISASTER: SIGNS OF DIMINISHED DANGER; DUEL OF WITS: A RUSSIAN FACES CONGRESS", "body_text": " **********While Soviet officials in Moscow were limiting themselves to terse announcements about the reactor accident in the Ukraine, a Soviet diplomat made an unexpected appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee today, where he allowed himself to be relentlessly questioned about the accident and the Soviet failure to inform the world about it. **********It was an extraordinary event, only the second recorded time in the last 15 years that a Soviet official has testified in public before a congressional committee, according to the Congressional Research Service's computerized search for precedents. **********The diplomat, Vitaly L.

Mr. Churkin parried. Grain Buying From Capitalists **********Could Mr. Churkin say whether radioactive material from the accident would damage Soviet grain production? In particular, would the accident force the Soviet Union to buy from the United States? **********''Well, I understand that this question is not based entirely on humanistic grounds,'' Mr. Churkin responded, drawing laughter from the crowd and an acknowledgement from Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, chairman of the hearing, that ''we are in a capitalist country now.'' **********Mr. Churkin, who testified after Federal officials spoke of the accident, answered questions in fluent English and made knowing references to American customs. He is an arms control specialist. **********Mr. Churkin's appearance was arranged just an hour before the hearing, at which Federal officials were scheduled to testify. Peter Franchot, a Markey assistant, called the Soviet Embassy at 10:30 A.M. to say that Congress and the world at large were concerned about the lack of Soviet disclosures and to offer the embassy a chance to explain the Soviet position. Mr. Franchot was told about 12:30 P.M. that Mr. Churkin would appear at the 1:30 P.M. hearing. A Barrage of Criticism **********Mr. Churkin was greeted by a barrage of critical questions and assertions about Soviet handling of the accident. Mr. Markey thanked him for appearing, but said ''the world is shocked and outraged'' by the Russians' failure to notify neighboring countries of the potential health hazards from the accident. **********Mr. Churkin called the disaster ''a horrible tragedy'' but said such accidents can happen ''when you're on the cutting edge of technological progress.'' **********Mr. Churkin largely repeated and paraphrased official Soviet announcements, but occasionally elaborated just a bit in his own language. Under questioning, Mr. Churkin said he did not know if the reactor was still burning, a reply that led several representatives to question whether either Mr. Churkin or his Government is sincerely trying to communicate information about the accident. **********''The problem is getting better,'' he said. ''It is not out of hand. It is being managed. The situation is improving. But unfortunately it is not yet all over with.'' **********Mr. Churkin described the situation in Kiev, the third-largest city in the Soviet Union, which is 70 miles from the reactor, as ''normal.''

But experts in electronic information delivery said the partners would probably try to provide a service in which pictures and text were transmitted over phone lines onto customers' television sets. **********The sources said that Citicorp would probably provide home banking and financial information; the Nynex Corporation, a regional telephone company serving New York and most of New England, would contribute transmission lines, and the RCA Corporation, an entertainment and electronics conglomerate, would provide the television sets or other terminal equipment. $100 Million Funding Estimated The venture, which will begin with research and development, might also provide entertainment and news out of RCA's NBC television network, as well as shopping from home, the sources said. They also estimated the operation would have an initial funding of about $100 million, So far, such videotex systems have been either too new to judge on continuing profitability or outright flops. In the Los Angeles area, the Times Mirror Company has a videotex service called Gateway that analysts say has only 2,000 customers and is unprofitable. Miami-based Knight-Ridder Newspapers has signed up more than 15,000 customers for its nationwide videotex service, called Viewtron, but advertisers have not considered that number high enough to warrant much financial support. **********Trintex, a joint venture of CBS Inc., Sears, Roebuck & Company and the International Business Machines Corporation, is reportedly two years from marketing its services. And Covidea, a videotex effort by Chemical Bank, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Time Inc. for customers in the New York area, is also in the start-up phase. Analysts Puzzled **********Because so many big, powerful companies have yet to earn significant returns from videotex, analysts were puzzled by the new venture. **********''It's a curious phenomenon,'' said Gary H. Arlen, a videotex consultant based in Bethesda, Md. ''The more companies that lose money in this business, the more that seem interested in getting into it.'' **********''There are a lot of people who have dropped a lot of money in this business, but I don't know anybody making money in it,'' said Charles S. Tepfer, a publisher of publications on video who is based in Danbury, Conn. Partners See Market **********For their part, however, the three partners in the new venture said they still believe there is a market for home information services. They said they would begin their venture doing research and development to determine which services customers want. **********''Information as a commodity has not caught on,'' said James N. Perkins, a 52-year-old video consultant who will head the venture. ''The parents have all recognized this, but they feel that there is a business out there somewhere.'' **********On the other hand, one reason the companies may have chosen to begin at the research level is that, under the agreement breaking up the Bell System, Nynex cannot sell information services. To do so through the joint venture, Nynex needs to apply for special permission from Federal District Judge Harold H.

Karpov, the chief negotiator at the Geneva arms talks, and Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, chief of the General Staff, who is a First Deputy Defense Minister. **********The presence of Marshal Akhromeyev is considered significant because he sounded a less positive note about the last summit meeting in Geneva than the political leadership. Western analysts believe Mr. Gorbachev is under pressure from the military not to give away any advantages in the development of new weapons. **********Marshal Akhromeyev did not attend the Geneva talks and his presence here suggested that Mr. Gorbachev wanted a military leader on the scene so he would not be subject to second-guessing from the military establishment afterward."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/17/world/greek-backs-liberation.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1986-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greek Backs 'Liberation'", "print_headline": "Greek Backs 'Liberation'", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who returned today from an official visit to Yugoslavia, said in a speech in Belgrade Wednesday night that a distinction must be made between terrorism and actions of liberation movements. **********''We condemn terrorism as a nonpolitical and uncivilized action,'' Mr. Papandreou said in a toast at a dinner given by the Yugoslav Prime Minister, Milka Planinc. **********''Of course, we always make a difference between terrorism and the struggle of liberation movements. **********''It is a very important difference, and it would be useful if every one in the world made that difference, because each country has the right and duty to struggle for its own independence.'' **********The passage was quoted by Tanyug, the official Yugoslav press agency. **********Less than a month ago in the same city, Secretary of State George P.

They received little notice although their work this year produced stunning revelations on Wall Street and generated millions of dollars worth of new products. **********For the most part, 1986 was a year in which Americans were swept up by national pride, a spirit generated by the celebration of the Statue of Liberty's centennial. People were eager to buy just about anything that smacked of Americana - from a $40 photo essay of the nation, which becamse the hottest Christmas seller in the bookstores, to a $400 gold coin newly issued by the United States Mint. The health binge this year put the spotlight on calcium, which turned up in the most unlikely places: orange juice, for example. And despite the drop in the dollar and the burst of patroitism, Americans purchased imports in greater volume than ever beofre in '86. That generated a big payoff for one South Korean automaker who dared to bring a new car into the oversupplied American market. The following is a glimpse of some of the year's unsung heroes: The Packagers Who Finally Scored A Publishing Coup RICHARD S. SMOLAND and David E. Cohen do not dress for success. The 37-year-old Mr. Smolan, known as Rick, sports granny glasses, a mustache, and a shoulder-length mane of brown hair. The 31-year-old Mr. Cohen has put his buttoned-down Yale days behind him and let his dark blond hair grow long. **********But their looks are deceptive. Working as a team, the pair has scored a major coup in the publishing business: Their $40 book of photographs, ''A Day in the Life of America,'' has crashed the best-seller list, with 345,000 copies sold and another 100,000 on order. Typically, a successful coffee-table book of this sort sells 10,000 copies; 50,000 in considered spectacular. **********The artistic merits of the book are arguable and some photographers question the team's business practices. Others point out that the idea is hardly original. For example, Life magazine had a similar original. For example, Life magazine had a similar idea in 1976 - and Mr. Smolan was a photographer on the project. But no one debates the book's smash ing commercial success. And that success appears to stem mainly from the Smolan-Cohen marketing techniques, even more than from the idea behind the book. **********The idea was to gather 200 of the world's best photographers to take whatever shots they wanted on May 2, 1986. Some 235,000 photographs were snapped that day, and 280 made it into the book. ''It was a little like the Olympics of photo-journalism.'' said Mr. Smolan. ''All the photographers were competing to get a picture in the book.'' **********But the real trick was raising the $4.75 million to finance the venture. No publisher was willing to put up that amount, so Mr. Smolan and Mr. Cohen asked corporations to be sponsors. **********Six companies provided $1.75 million in contributions: Eastman Kodak provided film and processing; Merrill Lynch gave cash; United Airlines, free transportation; Nikon donated cash and an underwater camera to each photographer; Apple Computer sold 500 MacIntosh computer systems to Smolan/Cohen at cut-rate prices, to be used as payments to participants; the Hertz Corporation provided free rental cars. In return, the sponsors names and logos were printed in the front of the book. The remaining $3 million came from the British-based Collins Publishing Company. **********But the role of the corporate sponsors went far beyond their direct contributions. They also plowed millions of dollars into publicizing ''A Day in the Life of America'' - and their own roles in it. In an unusual move, the publishers gave some 15,000 copies of the book to the sponsors, with the understanding that the companies would pass them on to ''trend setters.'' United Airlines sent copies to state governors, Merrill Lynch to chief executives of Fortune 500 companies. ''I think President Reagan got about 12 copies,'' Mr. Cohen said. **********Other factors helped, too. Local news media ran stories about hometown people and places tha had made it into the book. ''We have so many letters from people who appeared in the book saying they became celebrities.'' Mr. Cohen said. ''People are being celebrated for their very ordinariness.'' **********''A Day in the Life of America'' was not the first such book published by Mr. Smolan and Mr. Cohen. The initial effort was an Australia, where Mr. Smolan worked as a free-lance photographer. They also did smilar books in Hawaii, Canada and Japan. But, according to Mr. Cohen, although and the same formula was used, only the Canadian book made money. **********The two met when Mr. Smolan returned to New York from Australia a decade ago. With six other photographers they formed an agency and Mr. Cohen was the business manager. ''I was impressed by the fact he could say no to photographers,'' Mr. Smolan said of his partner. ''He forced people to make decisions, and then he held them to them.'' **********The personalities of the partners are very different. ''We come up with opposite solutions to problems,'' Mr. Smolan said. ''We were in Hawaii driving to an appointment. A truck in front of us was bellowing black smoke. I rolled my window down fro fresh air, he rolled his window up to keep the smoke out. The stragest thing is we're still friends after working together 10 years.'' The Compliance Officer Who Kept On Pushing **********THE letter - in a plain, white envelope mailed from Venezuela - was addressed to the compliance unit at Merrill Lynch's headquarters in New York. It arrived on May 22, 1985, and was shuttled to Richard M. Drew, a 44-year-old vice president and the No. 2 man int he 60-man division. **********A hefty, 6-foot-2 graduate of Fordham Law School, Mr. Drew examined the poorly spelled, typewritten letter carefully. Unsigned, it accused two of Merrill's salesmen in Caracas - Max Hofer and Carlos Zubillaga -of insider trading. Mr. Drew had no clue that he was about to begin unraveling one of the biggest scandals in the history of American business. **********But after 14 years at the New York Stock Exchange, many of them in surveillance activities, and four years in Merrill's compliance department, Mr. Drew sensed something special: ''I thought there were to many misspellings and that's what interested me.'' **********He though it strange that someone sophisticated enough to write to the relatively unknown compliance division - a unit that is part of all large securities firms and which insures tha rules are followed - would not know how to spell simple words. ''It seemed that the writer was trying to disguise any traces of who he might have been.'' **********Mr. Drew studied the salesmen's personal accounts and found they had been trading in takeover stocks - but only about five or six companies were involved, and the trades were small, never amoutning to more than $5,000. **********But Mr. Drew pressed on, calling for more documents. He found that Mr. Zubillaga had sent a check for about $10,000 to Brian Campbell, a former Merrill Lynch salesman in New York. ''That seemed strange,'' Mr. Drew recalls. **********Further sleuthing revealed that Mr. Campbell, who had since moved to Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, had bought some of the same takeover stocks as the Caracas salesmen. Further, Mr. Campbell's biggest client was Bank Leu of Switzerland, an account that moved with him when he left Merrill to join Smith Barney. ''Lo and behold,'' said Mr. Drew, ''Bank Leu had been trading in the same stocks that the three salesmen were trading in.'' **********Merrill flew the Caracas salesmen to New York for questioning. They admitted that Mr. Campbell had recommended stocks and they had paid him money for the information. Mr. Campbell adn Mr. Zubillaga had met when both worke din Merrill's international department in New York. In fact, Mr. Campbell had Mr. Zubillaga's automated teller card, enabling him to tap into the Venezuelan's New York bank account at will. **********On June 28, about a month after the letter arrived, Mr. Drew knew he had hit a dead end, since he had no access to Mr. Campbell or to Bank Leu, and he alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission. For the S.E.C., the key point was to investigate Bank Leu's transactions. It found that Bank Leu had been acting on behalf of Dennis B. Levine, an investment banker for Drexel Burnham, who pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges last June. In November, the S.E.C. announced that Ivan F. Buesky had been receiving information from Mr. Levine. **********Mr. Boesky was fined $100 million for his insider-trading activities and has been cooperating with the S.E.C. in its investigation. He still faces a criminal charge. Mr. Campbell has testified before the S.E.C., has not been charged with any wrongdoing and is still working for Smith Barney. The two salesmen have been fired and are believed to be in Caracas. **********Mr. Drew says he gets a sense of satisfaction out of the role he played: ''I hope it cleans things up and brings credibility back to the Street again.'' The Sculptor Who Shaped the Eagle **********MYLIE BUSIEK was flipping through a newspaper in 1982 she spotted a four-line item: the United States Gold Commission was considering minting a gold bullion coin. That was all the encouragement she needed. **********''I wanted to be in a position to offer my design,'' said the 45-year-old sculptor from Dallas. Today, Mrs. Busiek's ''family of eagles'' design graces one side of the American Eagle, the hot-selling gold coin the United States Mint began offering in October. (The other side bears a traditional Augustus Saint-Gaudens design of Liberty walking). **********''It's a dream come true for an artist,'' said Mrs. Busiek, who took up sculpting nine years ago and specializes in monumental sculpture, much of it commissioned by Dallas-based real estate developers, including the Trammell Crow Company, one of the nation's largest commercial developers. **********Investors and gift givers have snapped up more than 2.7 million American Eagles since October, providing the Treasury with nearly $700 million in revenue. The coins come in denominations ranging from $5 to $50, and prices vary with the price of gold. (The $50 piece was recently selling for about $430.) Officials say demand for the Eagle, the first investment-grade gold bullion coin minted by the United States in more than 50 years, continues to outpace expectations. **********Of the scores of people who had a hand in making the Eagle a success - from members of Congress to Mint director Donna Pope and her staff - Mrs. Busiek was perhaps the most unlikely. She received no money for her design, but succeeded in her mission: to lobby Congress to include her design in any gold coin legislation. ''She was tenacious,'' said one congressIonal aide who worked with her. **********''Nothing ever got her discouraged,'' agreed Christopher McLean, an aide to Senator J. James Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, sponsor of the bill that led to the Eagle. **********Mrs. Busiek's arsenal included more than 100 letters from prominent people endorsing her design. Her commitment to securing bipartisan support was scrupulous. When Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry agreed to write a letter, she promptly asked Joe Gibbs, coach of the arch rival Washington Redskins, to do the same. **********The inspiration for her campaign Mrs. Busiek said, was her belief that all Americans could identify with some element of her design. Her design, based on a sculpture she did for President Reagan's first inaugural, shows a male eagle flying over a nest with a female eagle and two newly hatched eaglets, one separated slightly from the mother, the other nestled under her wing. According to Mrs. Busick, the adults depict ''strong leadership, compassion and unity of purpose.'' The first eaglet represents ''those who are equipped for the challenges of the future,'' while the second stands for ''those among us who need speical care and nurturing.'' The Physician Who Set Off the Calcium Craze **********THIS has been the year of calcium. Sales of the chemical in almost any form have been booming. Sales of pills alone have soared to $165 million, more than double the level two years ago. Warner lambert, the pharmaceutical company, predicts tha sales of calcium supplements will rise another $10 million in 1987. **********Behind the boom is 59-year-old Dr. Robert P. Heaney, a quiet, goateed research physician who works at Creighton University Medical School in Omaha, his native city. Since 1955 Dr. Heaney has been searching for the casues of osteoporosis, an ailment that afflicts mainly older women. The disease causes a loss of bone mass that results in brittle bones, stooped posture and sometimes death from pelvic fractures. **********Part of the problem seems to be an imbalance in an individual's calcium makeup. And Dr. Heaney found that the maintenance of a proper calcium balance can be affected by the amount of calcium in one's diet. **********Dr. Heaney, of course, is not alone in his belief that sufficient calcium intake can reduce the risk of osteoprosis, and he acknowledges that the causes are complex and that the role of calcium is controversial. But, almost by chance, it was he who spurred the national calcium craze. **********The turning point came at the 1982 meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, where a scientific panel was to release guidelines on osteoporosis. Most of the other panelists failed to turn up for the news conference and Dr. Heaney, by default, became the spokesman. ''The phone has not stopped ringing since,'' he says. **********His role was enhanced in 1984, at a conference of the National Institues of Health, when Dr. Heaney released his calcium-intake guidelines: 1,000 milligrams for pre-menopausal women or for post-menopausal ones who take estrogen, and 1,500 milligrams for post-menopausal women not taking estrogen. **********Thus the rage began. Here is a sampler of new calcium products released just in the last three months: Delwood Dairy introduced a cottage cheese enriched with five times the ordinary level of calcium; the California Milk Advisory Board began offering a butter-like spread with twice the calcium of butter and began testing a high-calcium, low-fat milk; Procter & Gamble began fortifying its Citrus Hill products with calcium, and the Coca-Cola Company introduced Minute Maid Calcium-Fortified Orange Juice. **********Dr. Heaney reached many of his conclusions from studying the calcium balance of 200 Roman Catholic nuns; he began following the group in 1967, when their average age was 40. ''Our goal,'' Dr. Heaney said, ''has been to develop descriptive data on woen as they go through aging. Our second goal was to develop predictive tools.'' He says he is certain some of the women will develop osteoporosis when they reach age 65 or so. **********But Dr. Heaney warns that ''it's not just calcium that's important.'' Exercise appears to be critical as well: ''If your're out of shape, you have less bone.'' It is also important to get adequate vitamin D, and to avoid smoking and excessive alcohol. **********Of the boom in calcium sales, Dr. Heney says: ''You can't lose anything by increasing your calcium intake'' to the recommended levels. ''It's better to get it by taking foods than pills, but it's better taking pills than not getting sufficient amounts.'' The Executive Who Put the Hyundai in High Gear **********SOME years ago, experts commissioned by the South Korean Government advised the country's auto makers to concentrate on making parts rather than exporting finished cars. But Chung Se Yung, president of the Hyundai Motor Company, ignored them. In 1986 he began what would turn out to be one of the most successful initial forays into the United States auto market ever. **********''The United States is the largest, most sophisticated, toughest market in the world,'' Mr. Chung said last week. ''We'd been dreaming from the beginning of selling cars there.'' **********Hyundai Motors' Excel model took off like a rocket. A subcompact, front-wheel-drive car with a price tag betwen $4,995 and $7,515, the Excel is now the hottest-selling low-priced car in the United States. Since its debut in late February, more than 145,000 models have been sold - by far the best performance for a first-time import ever. Auto magazines praised the well-built, up-to-date Excel, preferring it to the Yugo car from Ygoslavia, the other low-priced import recently introduced in the United States. **********Mr. Chung, who has headed Hyundai Motors from its inception in 1967, clearly shares the venturesome spirit of his 71-year-old brother, founder of the Hyundai group, which has become a virtual symbol of South Korea's growing industrial might. At 58, Mr. Chung is a brisk, commanding presence. A graudate of Korea University, he earned a master's degree in political science from Maimi University in Ohio. He takes evident delight in his company's American success. **********From the project's start in 1981, ''our biggest worry was quality,'' Mr. Chung said. ''We knew the United States market was tough, but we didn't know that much else about the market.'' Crucial technological assistance came from Mitsubishi, which designed the engine transmission and power lines. Giorgetto Guigiaro, designer of the Fiat and the Alfa Romeo, was hired to design the car's body. In 1985, Hyundai began selling the Excel in South Korea as the final test of the car's quality. After one year, Mr. Chung said, ''we were quite confident.'' The company decided to go ahead in the United States. Despite the preparation, after about 4,000 models were shipped to the United States, Hyundai descovered a potential brake problem and had to recall them. But the recall did not put off buyers, and Mr. Chung said he hoped Hyundai could sell more than 200,000 cars next year. **********What next? ''We have plans,'' Mr. Chung said mischievously, ''but I'm not going to talk about them now.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/business/business-digest-thursday-january-9-1986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 670, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 1986", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 1986", "body_text": " **********Markets **********Stock prices plunged.

''You were in Spain. That is all that counts.'' **********The returning veterans fought on the side of the Republicans against the Nationalist rebels led by Gen. Francisco Franco in the 1936-1939 war. Franco was backed by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. He won and ruled until his death just 11 years ago. **********Many of the veterans said they felt vindicated that today the Socialists, part of the losing Republican coalition, govern in a solid Spanish democracy. ''We came back to a democratic Spain and you don't know how happy that makes me feel,'' said 72-year-old Charles Neusser of New York City. **********The Government and many Spaniards have paid quiet homage to the veterans. They have been feted on television and with civil war art, poster and movie exhibitions. There have been countless small gestures, too, such as the refusal of shopkeepers to let them pay for souvenirs. **********The Socialist Mayor of Madrid, Juan Barranco, gave a dinner for them and declared Mr. Neusser an ''honored guest.'' A leading newspaper, El Pais, campaigned to make him an honorory Spanish citizen for letters he wrote, but officials arrived at the conclusion that Spanish law allowed for no such category. **********Leading Spanish musicians are to join in a concert for the veterans Sunday and the Socialist mayors of Barcelona, Valencia and a number of other cities plan to honor them. **********The celebrations, however, stop short of a parade or anything that might treat them as national heroes. Many Spaniards still think right was on Franco's side against the leftist ideas of the Republicans. Many more Spaniards want to forget the war altogether. **********Except for historical accounts in the press this 50th anniversary of the start of the civil war has gone largely unnoticed in Spain. Some returning veterans have been surprised to learn they are about the only ones who still remember the old war songs, but most seem to have concluded that that is all to the good. **********''The Spaniards are making their own country,'' Mr. Neusser said. #1,400 Americans Died Of the more than 40,000 who fought in the International Brigades, about 15,000 died, according to the celebrations' organizers. Some 3,000 Americans fought; 1,400 died. **********''Being here scares me,'' said Harry Fisher, a 75-year-old New Yorker, as he stood in a plowed-under wheat field outside this town about 20 miles from Madrid. ''Here I experienced my first action and all the old fears have come back to me.'' **********The Lincoln Brigade went on the offensive here for 21 days in the scorching summer of 1937 in what turned out to be a bloody and largely unsuccessful attempt to ease the Nationalist pressure on Madrid. **********About half of the Americans who fought in the Lincoln Brigade were Communists then, and the rest mostly leftists, the survivors said. They were angered that the United States did not give arms to the Republicans and that on their return home they themselves fell under suspicion. **********There is no memorial in the United States to the men of the Lincoln Brigade, they said.

Gorbachev parted company in Iceland after appearing to be on the verge of making an arms pact of historic proportions, Administration officials and critics alike are still looking for answers to key questions about that meeting. **********How did a meeting designed, as both sides said, to give ''impulses'' to the arms talks explode into a full-fledged bargaining session? **********Was the Administration prepared for this, what exactly was agreed to, and do the two sides now agree on what was settled and what was not? **********Further, has the Administration shown that restricting tests of space-based weapons to the laboratory, as Moscow insists, would actually ''kill'' the Strategic Defense Initiative? Interview With Shultz **********Perhaps of the most elemental importance, has the Administration explained how it is prepared to maintain security for the United States and its allies in a world without nuclear weapons, in a world where Soviet conventional military superiority might then prove decisive? **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz addressed some of these questions in an hourlong interview yesterday with senior editors of The New York Times. It was devoted entirely to Mr. Reagan's two-day meeting with the Soviet leader in Reykjavik last weekend. **********Mr. Shultz and other senior Administration officials have spent the last two days trying, as their aides have acknowledged, to reshape perceptions of the Reykjavik meeting. Where Mr. Shultz and others initially called the meeting a deep disappointment, the Secretary spoke of it yesterday as a ''watershed'' event because ''for the first time the two sides agreed to dramatic reductions in nuclear and strategic arms.'' **********The Geneva arms talks resumed yesterday, and the chief American negotiator termed the Iceland meeting an unexpectedly successful ''serious and positive step'' in the direction of arms agreements.  [ Page A11. ]  Judging from the reactions of many strategic experts, legislators and Administration officials themselves, the answers from Mr. Shultz and other senior officials have not put basic questions to rest. **********For example, in the interview yesterday, Mr. Shultz insisted that he and Mr. Reagan were prepared for the wide-ranging negotiations. Yet he acknowledged surprise that the Soviet leader had once again linked an accord on medium-range missiles in Europe and Asia to a resolution of the future of space-based defenses, commonly called ''Star Wars.'' **********He was asked if the elimination of medium-range missiles in Europe would only enhance Soviet conventional or nonnuclear superiority on the Continent. He answered that he thought American and allied conventional forces there could manage that situation well. This judgment put him at fundamental odds with virtually all of the military and intelligence estimates from the Administration. **********Mr. Shultz and his senior colleagues have repeatedly stressed the dangers of Soviet cheating on an arms pact. They gave this as a principal rationale for Mr. Reagan's rejecting Mr. Gorbachev's proposal to limit testing of space-based weapons sharply. Yet, they expressed no discomfort with a situation where both sides would eliminate all ballistic missiles in 10 years, and where even a relatively small level of Soviet cheating - say, hiding 200 long-range missiles - could have profound consequences. Soviet Demands on 'Star Wars' **********Mr. Shultz repeated that the agreement on arms reductions foundered on Soviet insistence on confining space-based research to the laboratory. He reaffirmed Mr. Reagan's rejection of this on the ground that the United States would not ''learn as much,'' and that ''there are certain kinds of things that you can't really learn and feel comfortable about unless you see a demonstration.'' But he did not explain how what would be lost would actualy kill Mr. Reagan's ''Star Wars'' effort or outweigh the immediate advantages of reductions in offensive nuclear forces. **********Nor have senior Administration officials, including Mr. Shultz yesterday, fully rebutted the logic of Moscow's case against space-based defenses. Mr. Shultz and most of the others acknowledge that Moscow could have a point when it argues that a situation where both sides reduce their offensive nuclear forces by only 50 percent and also deploy a defensive system could be dangerous. **********In this case, one side could think it might strike first and blunt a retaliatory blow. Thus, the Administration understands that space-based defenses with offensive forces could be dangerous. **********By the same logic, the Russians argue that if all ballistic missiles were eliminated, as was tentatively agreed upon in Iceland, this should also eliminate the need for defenses against them. Mr. Shultz today reiterated the Administration's counterargument that the defenses were still needed as insurance against cheating. **********But he did not deal with the fact that once ballistic missiles were gone, the space-based defense system would still be years away from deployment. Thus, if Moscow had cheated and stored away missiles, the system would not be in place to guard against them. Focus Shifted at Reykjavik **********All statements by both sides just before the Reykjavik meeting pointed to a session that would focus on medium-range forces and perhaps nuclear testing as well. The theory was that these would be sufficient for Mr. Gorbachev to declare he was ready to set a date for a full summit meeting in the United States within a few months. That line was essentially continued by both sides on Friday just before the meetings began. **********According to accounts given during the meeting, the American side was surprised that Mr. Gorbachev quickly took discussions into the central questions of defenses and strategic forces. He even put forward a paper outlining his proposals. **********By all accounts at the time, Mr. Reagan responded, and they were into a full bargaining session. Each altered positions throughout the two days, essentially in directions of their previous public statements. **********But a number of Administration officials now acknowledge that their superiors are loathe to admit they were not ready for this. Doing so would indicate that the American side got into areas that had not been thoroughly prepared for beforehand. **********In particular, the American side expected that medium-range forces could be agreed upon separately from other issues. But Mr. Gorbachev clearly backed away from this in Reykjavik. Conflicting Soviet Statements **********Even in the last few days, to add to the confusion, the Russians have been issuing conflicting statements on this. One Soviet negotiator has been touring Europe reassuring Western leaders that a separate deal can be struck on medium-range missiles in Europe. But in Moscow, the line remains that everything is tied to everything else. **********On medium-range forces, the two sides agreed to having none for either side in Europe, and 100 for the Russians on their Asian territory equaled by 100 on American soil. **********On intercontinental-range or strategic forces, there is no dispute about what was to be reduced in the first five years. All strategic forces - land-based and sea-based missiles, bombers, and air-launched cruise missiles -would be cut by 50 percent. **********But over the next five years, the Administration says only ballistic missiles will be eliminated. Moscow says all strategic arms will be eliminated. **********The difference is considerable. By the American interpretation, both sides would be left with bombers and cruise missiles, where the United States holds a demonstrable advantage. By the Soviet interpretation, all long-range and medium-range nuclear forces would be destroyed, thus leaving the Russians with conventional military advantages on the Eurasian landmass. What Did Gorbachev Say?  Nor do Administration officials even agree among themselves over what position Mr. Gorbachev took and when on space-based defenses. Mr. Reagan said Mr. Gorbachev did not even raise the matter until the second day. Mr. Shultz said it happened on the first day, but he did not elaborate on what was said. **********Richard N. Perle, a senior Defense Department official, told reporters that the Russians did not initially insist on restricting ''Star Wars'' testing to the laboratory. They did so, he said, only after Mr. Reagan changed his demand for cuts in offensive forces from 50 percent to all ballistic missiles over 10 years. **********Administration officials at the working level and scientific experts generally remain split over what can accomplished in development of space-based defenses over the next decade. But almost all agree that no system of any consequence could be deployed for at least 10 years or more. How to Proceed With Research **********In the meantime, scientists and technicians continue to argue about how to proceed with the research program. There is a strong body of scientific opinion that holds that the program would proceed on a sounder basis and would not suffer consequential delays if it were restricted to a broad definition of laboratory research. Mr. Shultz said yesterday, ''Of course, it depends on what you decide you're going to call a laboratory.'' **********In addition, from Mr. Reagan on down, the Administration has repeatedly said the program's purpose is only to conduct research to determine if the system is feasible at acceptable costs.

ISSUES A BRIEF ON KAHANE", "body_text": " **********The State Department has argued in a legal brief that an American Jew's religious and political affinity for the state of Israel may form part of the basis on which he can be deprived of his American citizenship. **********The argument came in a 41-page document laying out the State Deaprtment's reasoning in its effort to cancel the citizenship of Meir Kahane, the Brooklyn-born rabbi who founded the militant Jewish Defense League and was elected last summer to Israel's Parliament on a platform of expelling Arabs from Israel and the West Bank. Like thousands of other Americans who have moved to Israel, he holds dual Israeli and American citizenship. **********The brief, written in the Office of the Legal Adviser to the State Department, was submitted to the department's Board of Appellate Review, which is considering the case. **********Lawyer Criticizes Arguments **********Mr. Kahane's lawyer, Charles S. Sims of the American Civil Liberties Union, denounced the State Department's arguments as an ''invitation to anti-Semitism.'' **********He said that the brief carried ''an implication that the religious commitment to the Jewish people is indicative of a less-than-patriotic commitment to the United States.'' **********Abraham D. Sofaer, the legal adviser, denied such an intent. In a written reply to questions from The New York Times, he noted that he, too, was a Jew with ''strong feelings toward Israel.'' **********''Kahane's religious views would have been irrelevant,'' he said, ''except that he strongly and publicly suggested that, because of them, he owes no allegiance to the United States and seeks to retain U.S. citizenship only for the purpose of insuring his continued access to this country. I see no connection between Kahane's case and that of the religious American Jew who supports Israel politically, morally or financially.'' #1967 Supreme Court Ruling Mr. Sims expressed doubts that the State Department had a case, given legal precedent. In 1967, the Supreme Court decided in favor of an American who had lost citizenship by voting in an Israeli election. The court ruled that Congress did not have the right to pass laws revoking citizenship and that citizenship might not be taken away unless a person intended voluntarily to give it up. This was a landmark decision for American Jews in Israel who had faced a hard choice in deciding whether to risk their American citizenship by participating fully in Israeli military and political life. **********Since then, many Americans have served in Israeli Government jobs, and a few have held elected positions there. Mr. Sims said Moshe Arens, a prominent member of the Herut Party, maintained dual United States and Israeli citizenship through many years of membership in the Israeli Parliament and during service as Israel's Ambassador in Washington. **********Only when he became Defense Minister in 1983, the attorney said, did the State Department tell Mr. Arens that by taking such an important post, he had relinquished his citizenship. 'An Expatriating Act' **********In the Kahane case, the centerpiece of the State Department's argument says that in running for election and taking a seat in Parliament, Rabbi Kahane ''has voluntarily performed an expatriating act and engaged in conduct indicating abandonment of United States citizenship.'' **********Since Rabbi Kahane has himself stated his desire to retain his citizenship, however, the State Department has summoned up numerous writings and speeches of his to document his shift of loyalty to Israel. **********The brief quotes Rabbi Kahane as writing of ''the need to have the character and color of the nation and state stamped with Jewish uniqueness.'' **********The State Department then comments, ''Such a need to belong to a state 'stamped with Jewish uniqueness' would, of course, be impossible to fulfill in the United States, where there is no established state religion.'' His Book Is Quoted **********The document quotes from a 1974 book by Rabbi Kahane, ''Our Challenge: The Chosen Land,'' in which he writes that in case of conflict between a Jew's duty to Israel and to ''the land in which he temporarily resides,'' he must ''give up his citizenship'' and return from exile ''to his permanent home, the Land of Israel.'' **********The brief concludes: ''Appellant's acts, statements and conduct demonstrate a gradual and complete transfer of allegiance to the State of Israel over a period of years. The expatriating act of taking a seat in the Knesset was manifestly the culmination of this long process.'' **********The Israeli Parliament itself is considering legislation to force members to relinquish non-Israeli citizenship. **********Without an American passport, Rabbi Kahane would need a visa to enter the United States, which the State Department has said it would be reluctant to grant. ''As a convicted felon,'' the department's brief says, ''appellant has good reason to believe that he might be ineligible for a visa to enter the United States.'' Rabbi Kahane has been convicted of making and possessing firearms. **********The steps against Rabbi Kahane began in October, when the State Department decided to deprive him of his citizenship. He then filed suit in Federal court, halting the action and leaving him with his passport pending final resolution. The case must proceed through the channels of administrative review before returning, if necessary, to the courts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/31/business/new-business-move-in-china.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Business Move in China", "print_headline": "New Business Move in China", "body_text": " **********As part of its program of economic changes, China plans the creation of limited liability companies, the official China Daily said Friday. **********The paper said a symposium had recently decided that China should experiment with such companies, which became common in Europe in the 17th century. **********But it added: ''China should not blindly copy the models of limited liability companies in the West.

''I need real hopes that such a meeting could take a new step. **********Shultz Meeting Canceled **********''If the American Administration realizes that this is the path to take, then we are ready for it,'' he said, referring to a summit meeting. ''But if it continues what it is doing today, attempting to poison the international atmosphere and worsen it, this will overshadow any plans for a future meeting.'' **********Last week, responding to the American bombardments of Tripoli and Benghazi, the Soviet Union canceled meetings in Washington between Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State George P. Shultz on May 14-16 that were meant to lay the groundwork for a summer summit meeting. **********Mr. Gorbachev, who is attending the East German Communist Party Congress in East Berlin, declined to be drawn out when asked whether the meeting would in fact go ahead. ''Let them take thought in Washington,'' he said, with his wife, Raisa, standing at his side. ''We are ready for serious steps toward peace.'' Had Agreed to Two Meetings **********At their first meeting, in Geneva last November, the American and Soviet leaders agreed in principle to hold two subsequent summit sessions - one in Washington in 1986 and another in Moscow the next year. This accord was widely hailed as one of the most important results of the Geneva gathering, since it appeared to set in motion a diplomatic process that might lead to arms control and other agreements. **********But meager progress in different arms control negotiations, the ambiguous outcome of the Soviet party congress in February and the sharpening tensions over Libya began to cast doubt on when or whether the Washington meeting would be held. **********The Administration has said it does not want to hold a summit meeting close to the November Congressional elections, when Mr. Reagan plans to campaign intensively, and officials in Washington say they need six to eight weeks to prepare security and logistics for a Gorbachev visit. **********At a speech to the party congress on Friday, Mr. Gorbachev denounced the Administration for resorting to ''the law of the jungle'' in bombing Libya, which Washington accuses of fomenting terrorism. **********But Western diplomats found his tone on Libya rather restrained, and noted that he embedded the Libyan events in the larger matrix of what he portrayed as a deteriorating East-West climate, stressing the failure to reach arms reduction agreements. Mr. Gorbachev's language today - and his reference to ''a new step'' to be taken by a summit meeting - also suggested that he was thinking more about arms control than about Libya. **********Some analysts of Soviet affairs have argued that Mr. Gorbachev emerged from his party congress in February with a weaker mandate than he might have wanted, and that he may be under pressure to produce concrete results if he holds a second meeting with Mr. Reagan. Offered Arms Inititative **********Despite the somewhat pessimistic tone of his speech Friday, Mr. Gorbachev used his presence in the East German capital to offer what he called ''a new initiative'' to try to unblock the stalled East-West negotiations on reducing conventional arms that have been held in Vienna for the last 13 years. He alluded today to this proposal as a sign of Soviet willingness to improve the international climate. **********Although thin on details, the Gorbachev initiative appeared aimed at West European concerns that a Soviet-American accord banning or severely cutting medium-range nuclear weapons could leave NATO exposed to the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional forces. **********The proposal drew considerable attention in Western Europe, and particularly in West Germany, where Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher urged studying its details and the opposition Social Democratic Party praised it. Mr. Gorbachev today signaled his sensitivity to West German opinion by concluding his impromptu remarks in Potsdam with a greeting to the people of the Federal Republic. **********Making a gesture with symbolic import, Mr. Gorbachev visited the Ceceilienhof, a mansion in Potsdam where the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain concluded the 1945 accord that confirmed the postwar division of Germany. He became the first Soviet leader to visit the imitation Tudor mansion since Stalin, Truman and Attlee, the British Prime Minister, signed the Potsdam pact. Importance of East Germany **********By singling out the East German party congress to attend, Mr. Gorbachev has underscored the economic and military importance that the German Democratic Republic has assumed within the Warsaw Pact. **********According to the East German news agency, he jokingly told Erich Honecker, the party leader, that in the Soviet Union the German initials for the German Communist nation - D.D.R.-were popularly translated in the Soviet Union as ''Davai, davai, rabotat!'' or ''Up, up, work!'' **********''You have worked well,'' Mr. Gorbachev was said to have told his host. **********The timing of the congress has presumably given the Soviet leader an opportunity to discuss Mr. Honecker's plans for making a milestone visit to West Germany, possibly this spring or summer. In his speech on Friday, Mr. Gorbachev did not allude to this sensitive topic, nor did he indictate opposition to such a trip. A similar visit was torpedoed by Soviet pressure two years ago. **********WHITE HOUSE COMMENTS WASHINGTON, April 20 - A White House spokesman, asked for comment on Mr. Gorbachev's statement, said: **********''The summit is in the best interest of both countries. President Reagan takes the commitment agreed to at Geneva seriously, i.e., there will be a summit in Washington in 1986 and Moscow in 1987, and assumes that Gorbachev does too. The United States is willing to negotiate with the Soviet Union because we want to solve the problem beteween our two countries.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/30/world/pow-s-alive-in-vietnam-report-concludes.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Berke", "pub_date": "1986-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 434, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "P.O.W.'S ALIVE IN VIETNAM, REPORT CONCLUDES", "print_headline": "P.O.W.'S ALIVE IN VIETNAM, REPORT CONCLUDES", "body_text": " **********A Pentagon panel, after a five-month review of intelligence files, has concluded that American prisoners of war are still alive in Southeast Asia. **********The head of the group, Lieut.

Grim Data on Crisis **********The report provided some of the grimmest data to date on the toll the debt crisis is taking on the 23 countries, which together account for two-thirds of the nearly $1 trillion that third world debtors owe foreign creditors. **********The report said that domestic output of goods and services in the entire region rose by only 3.9 percent between 1980 and 1985. Against population growth from 341 million to 385 million over the same period, the region's per capita output actually fell 8 percent, to $1,782 in 1985, from $1,933 in 1980. **********Fourteen countries suffered a decline of more than 10 percent in this key measure of living standards, and another seven suffered a drop of more than 15 percent. The seven were Bolivia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Guyana, Argentina, Uruguay and El Salvador. Quality of City Jobs **********Commenting on the region's employment picture, the report said: ''The quality of jobs available in the cities - where more than two-thirds of all Latin Americans now live - has worsened, since the industrial sector has stagnated (manufacturing output in 1985 was lower than in 1980), and construction suffered the steepest decline of all major sectors of economic activity.'' **********In 1985, countries with the highest unemployment rates included Panama, Uruguay, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile and Barbados, all well over 10 percent. Countries with the lowest rates, below 7 percent, included Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Costa Rica. **********But the report cautioned that unemployment figures were understated because of what it called the ''discouraged worker phenomenon,'' in which those who cannot find jobs give up looking for work and are thus technically not counted among the unemployed. ''In the main, this phenomenon mostly affects the participation of women and of young persons who are not heads of household, the groups that usually and more easily find alternative employment outside the formal labor market,'' the study commented. **********The bank's statistics indirectly shed light on trade problems of the United States, traditionally the biggest supplier of investment and other goods to Latin America. Between 1970 and 1980, the volume of Latin American imports grew much more rapidly than that of exports. Beginning in 1982, the year the debt crisis started, the trend was abruptly reversed. **********In 1985, the import volume of the region was 37 percent lower than the previous high achieved in 1981. Imports actually fell to a lower level than in 1974. **********At the same time exports, most of which are sent to the United States, were growing at a higher rate in the 1980-84 period than in 1970-80. Shipments in 1985 were 20 percent higher than in 1981. ''This increase reflects the extraordinary export effort the region has been making for the purpose of fulfilling its financial obligations,'' the bank commented. $200 Billion Trade Deficit But it also contributed to the worsening of the American trade deficit, which stood at $39.6 billion in 1981 and is approaching $200 billion this year. **********The bank estimated economic growth in Latin America last year at 3.5 percent, but stressed that much of this was accounted for by the ''outstanding'' 8 percent expansion of Brazil. ''The story of 1985 is really one of continuing decline, stagnation or only marginal improvement in nearly all countries,'' the report said. Excluding Brazil, growth in 1985 was less than 1 percent. **********''Not since the Great Depression of the 1930's has Latin America suffered such economic damage,'' said the chief author of the report, Miguel Urrutia, a former energy minister of Colombia who is manager of the bank's economic and social development department. He said at a news conference that ''in some ways the present crisis may be worse than the Depression because Latin American countries were starting to grow again in 1933-34, while in 1986 there is still no growth.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/21/world/syria-is-said-to-press-trench-work.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1986-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 591, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SYRIA IS SAID TO PRESS TRENCH WORK", "print_headline": "SYRIA IS SAID TO PRESS TRENCH WORK", "body_text": " **********The Israeli Army's Chief of Staff said today that Syria was continuing to dig trenches for armor and artillery in southern Lebanon. **********Speaking to reporters while on a tour of Israel's northern border region, Lieut.

He never stops. You can ask, 'How are these preparations manifested?' Each time differently.'' 'All the Time Make Preparations' **********''One time he deploys missiles along the border,'' he said. ''Another time he digs positions in the southern Bekaa Valley. Another time he holds preparatory maneuvers. The basic ideology of Syria is to all the time make preparations. We respond with our own deployments constantly, depending on what is happening in the field. And these have an effect on the situation.'' **********Last week, Israeli military sources revealed that since March, Syrian Army engineers using Lebanese workers have been digging trenches to hold tanks, bunkers for men and emplacements for artillery, about 10 to 15 miles north of the Israeli border. However, no men or military hardware have been deployed so far in the freshly dug emplacements. **********The Israeli sources said the digging was taking place in two areas. One area is north and south of a line running from the Lebanese town of Racheiye to the southern tip of Lake Karoun, and the other is around the village of Chebaa, on the western slopes of Mount Hermon in the area once known as ''Fatahland'' because Palestinian guerrillas had bases there. Potential Forward Position **********According to senior Israeli Government officials, what is disturbing about the Syrian actions in southern Lebanon is that they come after repeated Israeli requests, conveyed through the United States, to stop. Israel views the fortifications as a potential forward position for as much a division of the Syrian Army, should it decide to move into southern Lebanon from its current main line of deployment in the central Bekaa region along the Beirut-Damascus Highway. If the Syrians or their proxies did occupy these positions with artillery, they could easily threaten northern Israel, not to mention the ''security zone'' Israel has declared in southern Lebanon, Israeli military sources said. **********According to Israeli military sources, the Syrians are not only continuing to dig positions, but have also have been sending teams of officers on reconnaissance patrols to the area. The Israeli sources said they believe the officers are being brought down in small groups in order to familiarize themselves with the terrain and the configuration of the new positions, should the Syrian Army have to occupy them at short notice. **********While the new Syrian emplacements could be used for offensive purposes, military analysts noted, they are situated in a strategic defensive choke point from the Syrian Army's perspective. The trenches are in a blocking position on the main south-to-north route up the Bekaa region, which Israel could use in the event of a war to try to outflank the Syrian forces on the eastern Golan Heights and threaten Damascus from the west."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/12/world/hess-in-letter-says-he-is-in-severe-pain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hess, in Letter, Says He Is in Severe Pain", "print_headline": "Hess, in Letter, Says He Is in Severe Pain", "body_text": " **********Hitler's former deputy, Rudolf Hess, 92 years old, has told his family that he is in severe pain because of a hernia and cannot sleep at night, according to excerpts from a letter published today. **********Mr. Hess, the sole inmate of Spandau Prison in West Berlin, complained of searing stomach pain, as well as being three-quarters blind. **********Extracts from the letter to his family in Bavaria were published by the Munich magazine Quick.

Japanese makers have denied these charges. **********Some Differences Remain **********The gist of the agreements thus far appears to be that Japanese companies will submit information on their costs and prices to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the United States Department of Commerce so that the two government agencies can determine whether the makers are selling chips below the cost of manufacture, a practice known as dumping. Trade ministry officials said, however, that the two sides had not yet resolved their differences about market access and price monitoring. **********With conflicting reports reaching Japan about the contents of the agreements, most semiconductor manufacturers had no official comment. But some manufacturers, industry analysts and commentators have been voicing their fears that the eventual agreement will contain concessions that will weaken the Japanese semiconductor industry's access to the United States market and raise prices for American semiconductor buyers. In their comments, the analysts sounded a theme that is increasingly heard here: Japan has already made enough concessions to open its markets, and the United States is using its political clout to extract unfair agreements. **********In an editorial printed the day after the two sides reached a provisional agreement on one type of chip, the erasable programmable read-only memory, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said: ''The United States side can get important strategic information such as production cost and sales prices from Japanese producers. On the other hand, Japan cannot get the inside information on the American semiconductor industry. We can't help but say that this agreement is extremely unfair. The United States side went too far to force upon Japan an agreement that would practically lead to the control of the Japanese semiconductor industry, even if there is protectionist pressure from Congress.''

''I don't think this kind of agreement will end up helping the United States semiconductor industry,'' he said. **********In their discussions with industry analysts, semiconductor manufacturers have been more outspoken in condemning the concessions made so far by Japan. Many companies have been saying that they would prefer just to pay the dumping duties rather than make long-term agreements that might compromise their future competitive position. **********''The companies are really demoralized,'' said Carole A. Ryavec, an industry analyst and vice president of Japanese equity research for Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. ''They were hoping just to pay the dumping duties. They expected that MITI would take care of them better, but the agency buckled under to political pressure.'' **********Ms. Ryavec said that companies were worried about two points -whether information Japanese companies submit to the Department of Commerce would leak out to American competitors, and whether negotiators have agreed, as it is rumored, that the United States would monitor Japanese production and prices in third countries such as Southeast Asia, where Japan manufactures semiconductors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/20/business/new-manville-plan-expected.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW MANVILLE PLAN EXPECTED", "print_headline": "NEW MANVILLE PLAN EXPECTED", "body_text": " **********The trade creditors of the Manville Corporation, who object to the company's proposed plan of reorganization under Federal bankruptcy laws, said yesterday that they would propose an alternate plan. **********Manville, which has been in reorganization proceedings since August 1982, proposed a plan Feb. 14 under which it would establish a $2.5 billion settlement fund to pay the thousands of asbestos health claimants whose lawsuits sent the company into bankruptcy. **********The company's trade creditors and equity holders object to that plan because they say it unfairly favors the health claimants and does not leave enough money for them. **********The trade creditors said their plan would provide for payment in full to asbestos victims, improved payments for general creditors and ''enhanced recovery'' for shareholders. **********Under the Manville plan, which is supported by the health claimants and the company, future asbestos claimants would be enjoined from suing the company, and would receive compensation from the settlement fund. **********Leon Silverman, who represents future asbestos claimants and who helped design Manville's reorganization plan, said the creditors' proposal was an ''obstructive'' move with no legal effect because Manville still had the exclusive right under the law to propose a reorganization plan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/25/world/reagan-has-talks-on-tokyo-summit-and-calls-aquino.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1986-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 797, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN HAS TALKS ON TOKYO SUMMIT AND CALLS AQUINO", "print_headline": "REAGAN HAS TALKS ON TOKYO SUMMIT AND CALLS AQUINO", "body_text": " **********President Reagan conferred today with Congressional leaders and aides as he prepared for the longest journey of his Presidency, a 22,000-mile, 13-day trip to the Far East. **********The trip, which begins Friday when Mr. Reagan flies to Los Angeles for an overnight stay, will include meetings with Southeast Asian foreign ministers in Bali, Indonesia, and with the leaders of the seven major industrial democracies in Tokyo. **********Mr. Reagan took time from his preparations today to call President Corazon C.

Pet Food Seen as Target **********Anderson, Clayton is perhaps best known for its Gaines pet food, Chiffon margarine and Seven Seas salad dressings. **********The Ralston Purina Company, meanwhile, which is also trying to buy Anderson, Clayton, may have raised its offer $2 a share, to about $64,sources close to the deal said last night. **********Clayton family members, who control a third Anderson, Clayton stock, were said to have met with Ralston lawyers to discuss the sale of their shares. **********If such a sale were completed, it would give Ralston a third of the company and Quaker 23 percent, possibly creating an impasse between the two food manufacturers. **********Quaker refused to give any further details but food analysts said that it was plain to the industry that the company, like Ralston, wants the pet food division. **********To get their hands on Gaines, analysts said, both Quaker and Ralston are prepared to buy 100 percent of Anderson, Clayton and sell off what they do not want. Antitrust Complaint **********In a related development, Quaker is believed to have lodged an antitrust complaint against Ralston with the Federal Trade Commission, contending that if Ralston wins, it would control three times more of the pet food market than the next three pet food companies in the country. **********Quaker's announcement followed the news late Wednesday that two Wall Street firms, Bear, Stearns & Company and Gruss & Company, were withdrawing their unwelcomed offer to buy Anderson, Clayton for $56 a share, or $682 million. **********They withdrew the bid less than a week after Ralston proposed buying Anderson, Clayton for $62 a share, or $755 million. **********Part of the Bear, Stearns-Gruss deal called for Quaker to buy Anderson, Clayton's Gaines business for $250 million - a step that would have made Quaker the nation's second-largest pet food maker, after Ralston. Stake Bought in Open Market **********Quaker said only that it had bought its Anderson, Clayton stake in the open market. Wall Street sources said that part of the block came from the Bear, Stearns-Gruss group but Gruss said that it had not sold its part of the group's shares. **********Another part of the block is understood to have come from 7 million shares that stockholders originally sent to Anderson, Clayton in a self-tender but which Anderson, Clayton subsequently returned. **********On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Anderson, Clayton rose $2.25, to $65.50, in heavy trading while Ralston fell $1.125, to $62.875. That decline was viewed as routine market hedging by professionals. **********Analysts reasoned that Ralston would not have proceeded as far as it has without first studying the possible antitrust hurdles. **********But industry figures show that Ralston already has 28 percent of the $3 billion-a-year pet food business. If it succeeded in getting Gaines, Ralston would have about 35 percent of the market. **********The Carnation Company, the second largest, has only 12 percent, while Kal-Kan Foods Inc., No. 3, has 10 percent, and the H. J. Heinz Company, No. 4, has 9 percent. The three together, thus, have 31 percent against Ralston's possible 35 percent share. **********Quaker, on the other hand, has already cleared any possible antitrust problem. It said earlier, as part of the Bear, Stearns-Gruss deal, that it had sought Government clearance and that there had been no objection. **********Quaker currently has only 8 percent of the pet food business but would have 15 percent with Gaines, displacing Carnation for second place. Ralston's Strength **********David P. Garino, who follows Middle Western companies for A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said that pet food was by far the most profitable part of Ralston's business. He said that Gaines would ''clearly improve'' Quaker's competitive position if it succeeded in buying Anderson. **********He said that since Ralston was planning to sell its own animal feed business to British Petroleum, it seemed likely that it would sell Anderson, Clayton's animal feed business if it took over the company. **********Mr. Garino said that Ralston might also sell Anderson, Clayton's lagging insurance operations. He also said that while Ralston concentrated on brand names, it was unclear what it might do about Chiffon and Seven Seas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/world/aquino-unruffled-by-enrile-is-confident-of-army-backing.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1986-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 543, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AQUINO, UNRUFFLED BY ENRILE, IS CONFIDENT OF ARMY BACKING", "print_headline": "AQUINO, UNRUFFLED BY ENRILE, IS CONFIDENT OF ARMY BACKING", "body_text": " **********President Corazon C.

His pragmatic arguments overcame such emotional principles as anti-Americanism and opposition to military blocs that just two years ago were upheld by even his Socialists. **********Spain joined NATO under a conservative Government four years ago, and Mr. Gonzalez hammered home the point that continued membership would foster international confidence and investment in Spain and give it access to modern technology. **********Boycott Call Ignored **********On the flip side of such positive enticements were negative uncertainties, not the least of them being that the Government itself might fall, raising the specter of snap elections and domestic instability. **********A turnout of 60 percent indicated that many conservatives also put pragmatic national interests first. They ignored a call by Manuel Fraga, president of the Popular Alliance, the opposition group, and other conservatives to boycott the referendum in an attempt to unseat the Government. **********The referendum victory for NATO, which follows Spain's entry into the Common Market in January, confirms Spain's place as a Western country after centuries of isolationism. **********Yet it was a reluctant pragmatism. As late as last week, polls projected a Government defeat. The polls, backed by demonstrations, showed how the referendum was perhaps the most divisive campaign Spain has undergone since the death of Francisco Franco 11 years ago. At one point, Joaquin Leguina, head of the Madrid regional government, told Gerardo Iglesias, the Communist leader, that he was going to physically ''mash'' him. **********Political commentators said today that the pragmatism and lack of violence had been more in spite of the political leaders than because of them. **********''If Felipe Gonzalez could sound the heart of hundreds of thousands of voters, he would know they did not change their no vote or their abstention to a yes in order to prop up his Cabinet,'' El Pais, a leading daily, said in a front-page editorial.

A Spirit of Compromise **********On such basic issues as the drawing up of the Constitution and the handling of the military, the political leaders have struck a consensus and the public has followed. After Franco's death, it elected two moderate center-right governments that included former Franco officials and then the moderate center-left Government under Mr. Gonzalez. **********But NATO membership has been the exception. Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, a lame duck Prime Minister, pushed Spain into NATO over the objections of the Socialists. **********Mr. Gonzalez, then a NATO opponent, promised the referendum in his election campaign, though his aides now say that even then he was changing his mind. It was a referendum, they say, that should never have happened. **********Confident of victory, Mr. Gonzalez made little attempt to seek a consensus. Mr. Fraga, although he favors NATO, called for the boycott in an attempt to bring down the Government. Centrist leaders proclaimed neutrality. The far left and the Communists, politically marginal until now, won support by taking over leadership of the anti-NATO movement. **********''It is remarkable that despite the political irrationality the public maintained the common sense that has surprised us for the last 10 years,'' Juan Pablo Fusi, an historian, said. **********The issue now is whether wounds opened in the campaign will heal. **********Complicating the process is the approach of the fall elections. **********Mr. Gonzalez garnered nine million votes for NATO, just a million short of his majority in the 1982 elections.

Armacost, whose tenure at the helm of the BankAmerica Corporation has been marked by turmoil and huge losses, will resign this weekend, the banking company announced today. **********As Mr. Armacost's replacement, banking sources said, the board of directors is expected to name A. W. Clausen, the president of the World Bank until last June and the chief of BankAmerica until Mr. Armacost took over five years ago. The board is to meet on Sunday. **********Industry sources said directors had forced Mr. Armacost's resignation as president and chief executive officer. The sources said the directors had become convinced that a change was needed to restore the health of the nation's second-largest banking company and the confidence of customers and investors. Citicorp, based in New York, is the nation's largest banking institution. **********A Takeover Target **********BankAmerica, buffeted by rumors in recent weeks, is now the target of a takeover offer by First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles, a bank less than half its size. **********Industry sources said the BankAmerica board had gradually become disenchanted with Mr. Armacost and that the bid from First Interstate, received last Friday, had tipped the scales. **********Appointing a new chief could be a prime element in a plan to buy time and remain independent, some analysts contend. Others, however, argue that directors might want to consider the takeover and that they had dismissed the 47-year-old Mr. Armacost because he was adamantly opposed. **********First Interstate declined to comment on what it would do now. The bank is expected to continue to press its bid, a stock transaction that First Interstate values at $18 a share, but which analysts value at closer to $15 a share. **********BankAmerica's stock rose 62.5 cents today, to $14.875, on the New York Stock Exchange, after the news of Mr. Armacost's resignation. **********The choice of Mr. Clausen, who is 63 years old, would be controversial. Mr. Clausen, as Mr. Armacost's predecessor from 1970 to 1981, is considered responsible for many of the moves that led to the problems at the banking company, which has staggered under huge losses caused by bad loans. **********Along with Mr. Armacost, Leland S. Prussia, 57, the chairman of BankAmerica Corporation, is also expected to resign. The bank would not comment about Mr. Prussia, whose responsibilities have been diminishing in recent months. **********In a statement issued today, BankAmerica said that Mr. Armacost would step down both as president and chief executive of the BankAmerica Corporation and as chairman and chief executive of its principal subsidiary, the Bank of America. **********Mr. Armacost, quoted in the bank statement, said he was leaving to help restore confidence in the bank. **********''External perceptions about the bank have been so eroded by rumor and speculation that a change in management is necessary to help restore confidence in this organization's capabilities and future,'' Mr. Armacost's statement said. ''The best interests of our shareholders, customers and employees have always been my principal concern, and if my stepping aside serves that purpose, I do so willingly.'' **********BankAmerica has been hurt by losses stemming from bad loans to foreign nations and to companies involved in energy production, real estate, agriculture and shipping. It also was caught in an embarrassing scandal involving real estate securities that cost it $95 million. A String of Surprises **********After each setback, Mr. Armacost maintained that the bank was on its way to an improvement, only to be surprised yet again. The directors seemed to back him but drew criticisms from the investment community that they were too lax. **********Recently, the unpleasant surprises have come in a cascade. The bank had a loss of $337 million in 1985 and eliminated the common stock dividend. Then, in the second quarter of 1986, a few months after predicting a turnaround, the bank lost $640 million, the second-largest quarterly loss in banking history, topped only by the $1.16 billion lost in the second quarter of 1984 by the Continental Illinois Corporation, which was later saved by the Federal Government. **********Since then, Charles R. Schwab, one of the early dissenting board members, quit his board seat. In September, the bank was battered by rumors that it was in financial straits. **********All the while, the bank has been laying off employees and selling assets to raise money. It even sold its symbol, its red granite headquarters that towers over the San Francisco skyline. And the bank was recently bothered by disclosures that top executives had been granted severance packages, popularly known as golden parachutes, that would entitle them to large payments if they lost their jobs after a takeover. **********Banking sources say board members have gradually realized that Mr. Armacost would have to be replaced, if only to restore bank credibility. Regulators' Thoughts **********Banking sources in Washington said today that for at least two months Federal bank regulators had been discussing their concerns about the quality of management at Bank of America, and Mr. Armacost's policies in particular. The sources said that the regulators had made their thoughts known to the board members at Bank of America but that they had not demanded Mr. Armacost's resignation. **********A search for a successor has been led by two prominent San Francisco businessmen, John R. Beckett, the retired chairman of the Transamerica Corporation, and John R. Grey, former president of the Chevron Corporation. Mr. Beckett is chairman of the BankAmerica board's executive committee, which makes him responsible for executive appointments. **********The board faces extra pressure because last year BankAmerica lost its insurance policies that covered directors in the event of shareholder lawsuits. The bank has since set up its own insurance policy to protect directors, but the insurance is considered small. The bank has already been subject to numerous shareholder lawsuits because of the steep decline in its stock price. The Earlier Reign **********During Mr. Clausen's earlier reign, BankAmerica grew rapidly, largely by becoming aggressive in making loans to foreign nations, farmers and real estate companies, and in taking on a large portfolio of residential mortgages. After Mr. Clausen left, many of the loans went sour, contributing to the problems of Mr. Armacost, Mr. Clausen's chosen successor. With this background, many analysts said that Mr. Clausen, who appointed many of the currrent BankAmerica board members, might not be the best choice for the job. **********''It's not clear that Clausen's the right guy or will have that perception of credibility,'' said Lawrence W. Cohn, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''I guess what you're seeing is a board of directors who felt they had to do something and turned to the guy they felt comfortable with.'' **********James McDermott, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, commented, ''While Clausen does carry some of the taint of the bank's record, he does bring a very stable and familiar track record.'' **********Mr. Armacost took over the BankAmerica job at a young age. The bank's earnings have declined steadily during his tenure, until finally the bank has begun to lose money. **********While banking sources say some of the BankAmerica's problems stem from Mr. Clausen's first tour, Mr. Armacost is blamed for not grasping their extent and for not acting swiftly enough to turn the situation around. Other Candidates **********Some analysts suggested that other candidates could have been better choices than Mr. Clausen, such as Thomas A.

First, it was for a Cabinet member's insulting comments about Koreans, then twice for his own observation that blacks, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans had lowered American educational levels. **********The Apologetic Society **********Although to foreigners this burst of public contrition may seem unusual, Japanese recognized that Mr. Nakasone was doing what comes naturally. Being a Japanese, even a national leader, is always having to say you're sorry. **********There are few people in this country who can get through the day without making at least a few apologies. **********Japanese apologize automatically when they enter a room, saying they are making a nuisance of themselves. Then they apologize for the same reason when they leave. **********Without having to think about it for a second, they say they are sorry if they have not spoken to a person in some time, for it was impolite to have ignored him. But they say the same thing after finally speaking, for it was rude to have taken up his valuable time. **********Sometimes they begin a phone call by apologizing for the previous conversation, since an offense of some sort must have been committed. Appearance Over Substance **********A polite Japanese expresses contrition when serving dinner to house guests - ''I don't think this will suit your taste.'' He apologizes for ''this trifle'' when giving a gift, even if it is a gold watch. If he is a politician, he wastes little time before telling people at a rally that he is sorry to have kept them waiting. **********It goes without saying that a Japanese will also express contrition if something goes truly wrong, as when people fail to appreciate his reflections on American minorities. **********Genuine sincerity is not especially important, however. Appearances are what count. **********That is not to suggest that Mr. Nakasone is insincere when he says he is sorry. But Japanese understand that apologies are designed to insure social harmony, and have little to do with questions of right and wrong. **********''It's a social tactic,'' said Suzuko Nishihara, a research chief at the National Language Institute in Tokyo. ''It is expected that if you say 'I'm sorry,' everything will be all right.'' Even the Emperor Apologizes **********''Mr. Nakasone's apology is very Japanese,'' she said. ''I'm sure he expected the Americans or Koreans to immediately pardon what he had done. That is the Japanese pattern.'' Even Emperor Hirohito cannot escape this social imperative, although pains are taken to make sure he does not go overboard. **********In the last dozen years, the Emperor has been called on three occasions to account in public for Japanese wartime aggressions against the United States, China and Korea. The purpose was to smooth latter-day relations with those countries. **********But the idea of a full-throated imperial apology was too much for many Japanese. So the Goverment, which drafts his speeches, confined Hirohito to vague references to the ''unfortunate past'' and how it was ''regrettable.'' It was left to others to argue whether those were really apologies. **********So ingrained is the social reflex that Japanese feel they sometimes must unlearn it on travels abroad. Where 'Sorry' Implies 'Guilty' **********A Tokyo office worker who lived for a while in New York said that Japanese friends there had advised her not to apologize too readily to Americans when confrontations arose. In the United States, they warned, saying ''sorry'' could be taken as an admission of wrongdoing, inviting legal action. **********Tamiko Kikuchi, a secretary in Chiba, east of the capital, recalled an argument between her sister and the sister's young daughter. The daughter, who was educated in France, fought fiercely, defending her position against her mother's. **********''My sister kept telling her to apologize, but she never would,'' Ms. Kikuchi said. ''If it had been my daughter, who was raised in Japan, she would have cried and quickly apologized, even if she didn't accept my logic.'' **********As a legal tool, almost nothing beats an apology for escaping serious trouble. It can help someone, literally, to get away with murder. **********''You cannot clearly assess what affect an apology has on the judge,'' a Tokyo lawyer said. ''But it is true that if a culprit is believed to show 'deep regret' it will be considered favorably.'' The Crime of Insouciance **********Convicted killers in this low-crime society are often sentenced to only a few years in prison if they ''self-reflect'' and show remorse. **********In contrast, Japanese newspapers and magazines have been merciless in their handling of Kazuyoshi Miura, who is charged with trying to kill his first wife and has also been questioned in the shooting death of his second wife. Mr. Miura can expect similarly tough treatment by the courts. **********What infuriates many Japanese, more than the crimes he is charged with, is Mr. Miura's unfailing insouciance. **********People in business also find that apologies can be handy. **********When building a new house, contractors take small gifts to the neighbors, saying how sorry they are for causing them inconvenience. To do otherwise would invite construction-noise complaints. **********Japan Air Lines experienced few law suits in 1982 when a berserk pilot deliberately plunged his plane into Tokyo Bay, killing 24 people. It helped that the company president, Yasumoto Takagi, went from family to family offering deep regrets. Penalties for Low Remorse **********Mr. Takagi got off far less lightly after another of his aircraft crashed into a mountainside last year, killing 520 people. **********Since then, there has been a spate of suits. In part that is because of the enormousness of the disaster, the worst in aviation history involving a single plane. But victims' relatives also complain that the airline did not show adequate contrition this time. Mr. Takagi's appearance on a golf course soon after the accident was cited as proof that he lacked remorse. He was forced to step down. **********''It is not enough just to say you're sorry,'' Ms. Nishihara said. ''You have to seem to show it, including the right facial expressions.'' **********There is one conspicuous tear in this nearly seamless pattern of humility. When Japanese mass in large groups, their politeness can become a memory. **********On the subways, they pummel their way into trains, step on toes and stick umbrellas into each other's legs. They almost never stop to apologize, not even to offer a perfunctory regret for the recent unfortunate past."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/07/business/bonn-officials-expected-to-delay-a-cut-in-rates.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1986-06-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 631, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BONN OFFICIALS EXPECTED TO DELAY A CUT IN RATES", "print_headline": "BONN OFFICIALS EXPECTED TO DELAY A CUT IN RATES", "body_text": " **********West German monetary authorities, whose fear of inflation has long made them loath to cut interest rates, are likely to stick to that position until key interest rates in other European countries are cut first, analysts say. **********That reality almost certainly is a disappointment to the Reagan Administration, which had been pushing for another round of coordinated interest-rate reductions. And it may be the reason that the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Paul A. Volcker, said on Thursday that he did not preclude a unilateral rate reduction by the Fed. **********Over the last few months, foreign exchange traders and economists say, the mark, long Europe's dominant currency, has come under unusual pressures against a number of major currencies, including the French franc, the British pound and the Japanese yen. **********Mark Strong Against Dollar **********Those pressures, the consequence of large interest rate differentials and a realignment of European currencies within the European Monetary System, have had the effect of driving down the value of the mark in Europe, even though it remains very strong against the dollar. In order to prevent the mark from sliding further, short-term West German interest rates, currently about 4.6 percent, are not likely to be lowered further. **********Much of the recent pressure has occurred since April 8, when finance ministers representing the eight countries that make up the European Monetary System agreed to realign the value of the currencies. The biggest adjustment was a 5.8 percent devaluation of the French franc against the mark. **********The full weight of the devaluation has not been felt in France, because in the wake of the realignment billions of marks have poured out of West Germany and into short-term French franc deposits that on average are yielding about three percentage points more than similar German instruments. **********''The franc won't sit where they want it to sit,'' said David Buchen, head of foreign exchange operations at the Bank of America in New York. **********''It is right at the top of its parity against the mark, and has put the Germans in the unusual situation of having a mark that is too weak against other European currencies but too strong against the dollar,'' he said. ''With that sort of schizophrenic exchange rate situation, I don't think there is any reason for them to reduce their rate structure.'' **********British interest rates, currently about 10 percent, have also been attracting West German capital, putting downward pressure on the mark versus the pound. **********''Recently the mark has been quite weak against sterling,'' said David Morrison, a London-based international economist for Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''And the chief reason for it is the large difference in short-term interest rates.'' Pressure From the Yen **********The mark has also come under pressure against the yen, but for different reasons. **********Since the meeting of finance officials of the United States, Japan, Britain, West Germany and France at the Plaza Hotel in New York last fall, ''it has become clearly evident that the yen was going to be the easiest currency to appreciate,'' said Richard B. Dickson Jr., a foreign exchange trader at Salomon Brothers. **********A great many traders bought the yen against the mark. ''In a sense, the mark has become the whipping boy of the yen, if only because it has become a logical cross-rate to play, Mr. Dickson said. ''That situation plus the unusual developments in Europe have pushed the mark into a rather odd situation.'' **********None of these developments have been lost on West German monetary officials, who have been under pressure from the Reagan Administration to cut interest rates even more as a way of stimulating faster growth in Europe and the other major industrial countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/25/business/appeal-is-doubted-on-rail-decision.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1986-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 645, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "APPEAL IS DOUBTED ON RAIL DECISION", "print_headline": "APPEAL IS DOUBTED ON RAIL DECISION", "body_text": " **********Wall Street investment bankers, stock market analysts and sources close to the Interstate Commerce Commission expressed doubt yesterday that the Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation would appeal the I.C.C.'s decision to deny the merger of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Company and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company. **********The $2.6 billion merger, put together with considerable fanfare by Morgan Stanley & Company for the Southern Pacific and Salomon Brothers for the Santa Fe, was the biggest deal of 1983. **********Many argued that the Santa Fe would now decide to put one or both railroads on the block almost immediately or possibly spin off stock to shareholders.

TALK", "print_headline": "KEY SECTIONS OF CHIRAC'S U.N. TALK", "body_text": " **********Following are key sections of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's speech today to the General Assembly, as distributed in translation by the French Mission: **********The 40th anniversary of our organization, while being an occasion for celebrating our accomplishments, has also reminded us of the limitations that reality has imposed on the implementation of the Charter. **********No one disputes the existing shortcomings in cooperation among the members of the United Nations. But this necessary clear-sightedness should not lead us to take a pessimistic view. **********For France, on the contrary, only the realism we shall demonstrate can give us the assurance that we will be capable of resolving the problems of today and in the future. **********While the world is tending to become a single space, it has not been able to overcome the threats and collective challenges confronting it. Conflicts and human rights violations are increasing while the cancer of terrorism is spreading. The arms race is continuing under the spur of technological progress, the benefits of which ought rather to be shared with the world at large. Lastly, the economic and financial situation of many third world countries remains very critical. **********Principles for the Mideast **********In the Middle East, France has long maintained that peace must be based on principles which for us are self-evident. Israel's security and right to existence must be acknowledged and guaranteed; the Palestinian people must itself be in a postiion to exercise its right to self-determination. **********Peace presupposes first of all mutual recognition of the parties concerned and their paramount responsibility in the quest for a settlement which cannot be achieved by outside powers, useful though their contribution is. **********This being so, the possibility of convening a conference at which all the parties concerned are present and which would be prepared in an adequate manner has once again been mentioned. We approve of this in principle and are ready to play our role to the full to help find a solution to a conflict that is too serious for the international community to have the right to regard itself as powerless. **********Among the favorable signs that may be noted is the idea of a necessary dialogue, which is gaining grond, albeit slowly. France has consistently welcomed indications to this end. **********Unfortunately, these rays of hope cannot allow us to forget the unending crisis that is tearing Lebanon apart. The French Sacrifice **********France has made ceaseless efforts - at the price of considerable sacrifice - to promote the return to peace longed for by the vast majority of the Lebanese. **********To this end France participated in international actions which made it possible to limit the chaos in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion. Our Ambassador to Beirut, Louis Delamare, was one of the first to pay with his life for his untiring efforts to renew dialogue between brother enemies. Dozens of French soldiers have been killed trying to make it possible for the country to return to the rule of law and bring back a minimum of normal life to the civilian populations of Beirut. **********In the south of this martyred country, the international community is endeavoring to prevent an escalation of the fighting and senseless violence. Side by side with other national contingents of Unifil, French soldiers have too often paid for a peace mission with their lives. But of late, the situation has become intolerable. **********The United Nations force is no longer just being caught in the sporadic clashes between the enemies it is supposed to keep apart; it has become the target of methodically prepared attacks which soon will leave it no alternative other than to retrench in order to insure its own safety. **********We are bound to note that since its formation in 1978 Unifil has been unable to carry out the mandate entrusted to it by the Security Council. This is why France called the Council's attention to this state of affairs last April and appraised it of our concerns. The events of the past few weeks have unfortunately confirmed our assessment. Facing a Serious Challenge **********The sacrifices that we have accepted to date give us the right to demand that each of us assume his responsibilities and that the means made available to the force match its mission. What we are facing is a serious challenge to our organization, its authority and its ability to carry out peacekeeping operations. **********The tragic events in Istanbul, Karachi and Paris prove once again that terrorism has become the systematic weapon of a war that knows no borders or seldom has a face. **********Admittedly, the phenomenon is not a new one and cases of it are far too numerous. I am, however, struck by the recent surge in terrorism and the growing number of victims. How can I fail to mention here, more particularly, the French, American and British hostages held in Lebanon? **********The international community, unless it chooses to delude itself, should recognize that it has not always shown the necessary lucidity toward ths scourge which some would like us to think is the sole means of expression of the oppressed. The odious methods it uses, the slaughter of innocent people perpretated in free societies, the ongoing blackmail over the lives of hostages rule out our confusing, even in some small way, those actions with genuine resistance. **********To be sure, no one is going to deny that the persistence of unresolved conflicts, with their train of injustices, is not one of the sources of terrorism. But we have to denounce many other causes as well: the rising tide of intolerance and fanaticism; the complicity of states that are willing to close their eyes to terrorist organizations' activities or that do not hesitate to use them to their own advantage and even actually encourge them. The Response to Terrorism **********In a world in which indiscriminate terrorist violence can reach the citizens of all states, a reaction had to occur. **********We are satisfied to see that the General Assembly, reflecting this world-wide realization, condemned these cowardly and criminal practices last year, and that the Security Council and the Commission on Human Rights have spoken out strongly against hostage-taking. France, which took the initiative to bring this before the Commission on Human Rights, wishes to underscore, however, the need to accompany these texts, whose political significance is evident, with the concrete measures that the situation requires. **********The determined action that is called for would be made easier if all states were to effectively observe the obligations incumbent on them by virtue of international law and the conventions to which they have subscribed. **********I venture to hope that the healthy reaction of the international community expressed here will encourage all states to cooperate, more particularly in strengthening air and maritime security, and will convince them of the need to work through all appropriate channels, national and other, to eradicate terrorism. U.N. and the Nuclear Age **********Since its founding, the United Nations and the entire international community has had to face up to the strategic realities of the nuclear age. **********France is convinced that nuclear deterrence, which has prevented a direct confrontation between the two superpowers for the past 40 years, remains an irreplaceable factor for peace. France is also convinced that there is no alternative in human sight, in spite of the progress that can be expected from high-technology undertakings that France has put itself in a posiion to fully participate in. **********All the speakers here have stressed the importance that progress in the current negotiations in Geneva between the Soviets and Americans could have for East-West relations. Frnce has already said many times that it would welcome a priori such prospects as might be opened by a Soviet-American summit meeting this year. It recognizes in particular the importance that an agreement on a global limitation of intermediate-range weapon systems could have in the world. It wishes to observe, however, that the reduction of those systems wuld affect only a very small part of the American and Soviet nuclear arsenals. **********France has naturally declined to go along with any form of planned obsolescence of its forces while other powers retain a huge excess nuclear capacity. It will accept neither a quantitative nor a qualitative freeze on its arsenal nor will it halt its nuclear tests. The Meaning of Chernobyl **********France, like the rest of the world, was disturbed by the Chernobyl accident. The accident should not serve as a pretext for those who seek to speculate on fear and irrational sentiment. The analysis recently completed in Vienna by international experts confirm the specific nature of the Soviet reactor: the lessons of the Chernobyl tragedy cannot be transferred as such and applied to Western-type installations. **********France will continue to help interested countries acquire the benefits of the civilian applications of the atom once there is appropriate international monitoring to guarantee that the fruits of such cooperation are not diverted. **********We are bound to note that the economic and financial situation of numerous third world counties, especially the least developed among them, appears to have grown much worse. **********The African countries know from experience that the efforts they have courageously decided to undertake will have the resolute backing of France. **********France provides more aid to sub-Saharan Africa than any other country. Its contribution to the development of the continent as a whole has not flagged over these past years. No one should doubt that this will not be the case in the future. **********Debt has become the dominant preoccupation for too many developing countries. It does not allow governments the necessary freedom to resolve their long-term development problems. Areas of Cooperation **********France, for its part, believes that it is necessary to increase international cooperation in three areas: *********** First of all, there must be greater financing for the developing countries to ease the grip of debt. I should like to add, there is no example of a country that has not had to have recourse to substantial external financing during its industrialization phase.With regard to bilateral aid to development, France will again increase its effort in 1987 compared to 1986 , with a view to attaining its target of 1 percent of G.D.P. *********** In the second place, the remarkable efforts to insure economic recovery embarked on by the developing countries must be continued. Noteworthy results have been achieved in the battle agaist internal and exernal deficits, in curtailing inflation and in implementing bold economic policies that emphasize thd long-term interests of nations rather than favoring the illusory, fragile solutions of short-term policies. *********** Lastly, it is essential to correct the current disorders of the international economic and financial system.

Full scholarships become partly subject to tax for the first time, and borrowing money for a college education will become more expensive for many people. Student loans, like other consumer loans, become nondeductible unless the debt is part of a home mortgage. **********''If dollars are taken out on the one side, students are going to be pressed to come up with money to make up the difference,'' said Clark L. Bernard, director of the higher education practice at the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand. **********Saving more will be no easy task when these provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 go into effect Jan. 1. **********In the past, children were ideal tax shelters. Any investment placed in a child's account was subject to little tax since all income from the investment was taxed at the child's low rate. In addition, the first $1,080 was completely exempted from tax by the child's personal exemption. These tax benefits helped build a larger nest egg for the child's college education. **********Under the new rules, only the first $1,000 a year of investment income of a child under age 14 will be taxed at his or her own rate. The rest will be taxed at the parent's rate. **********Not until the child reaches 14 is the income taxed as before - at the child's own tax rate. **********However, no matter what their age, children will no longer be able to claim a personal exemption. Instead, they will be allowed to use $500 of their standard deduction to shield investment income from taxes. Thus, only the first $500 of a child's investment income will escape tax-free -less than half the tax-free threshold of the old law. **********Consider a boy under 14 who has $1,200 of investment income. The first $500 will be shielded from tax by the standard deduction. The next $500 will be taxed at his own 15 percent rate. And the final $200 will be taxed at his parent's rate. **********If the child is 14 or older, the first $500 will be shielded from tax by the standard deduction. The rest will be taxed at his own 15 percent rate. **********The tax treatment is the same no matter who gives the money to the child, whether it is the parent, an uncle, a grandfather or a family friend. Clifford Trusts **********For children of any age, the new law deals a death blow to Clifford Trusts, spousal-remainder trusts and other trust arrangements that were widely used by upper-income families as vehicles to save for a child's education. **********''You can say that Clifford Trusts have been repealed for all intents and purposes,'' said Thomas W. Kuchta, a tax partner at the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse. Clifford Trusts got their name from a landmark Supreme Court case involving a trust set up by George P. Clifford Jr. more than four decades ago. **********These trusts became popular because the parent could put income-producing assets in the trust, have the income taxed to the child and then take the property back after 10 years. With such a trust, there was no worry that the child would end up with the legal right to the property when he reached majority age and might buy a Porsche instead of going to college. **********Congress destroyed the advantage of these trusts by making the income taxable at the parent's rate rather than at the child's lower rate. **********Trusts established on or before March 1, 1986, are protected from the new rules with two exceptions. Assets transferred to existing trusts after March 1, 1986, are not exempt from the new rules, so there is nothing to gain by putting anything more in existing trusts. In addition, trust income distributed to the account of a child under 14 falls under the new rules relating to investment income of younger children - that is, amounts over $1,000 will be taxed at the parent's rate. Investment Vehicles **********High-yielding investments were traditionally recommended for children's accounts because the income was partly or fully sheltered. They may still be the preferred choice for children over age 14 as well as for children under 14 who have less than $1,000 a year of investment income. **********But for children under 14 with larger amounts of investment income, new strategies are now urged. **********Instead of investments that generate taxable income each year, tax advisers say, parents should consider investments that defer taxable income until the child reaches age 14, when the income will be taxed at the lowest rate. **********If the child is very close to 14 - say 13 years old - the answer might be as simple as a one-year Treasury bill that does not mature until the child reaches age 14, said David S. Rhine, a tax partner at the accounting firm of Seidman & Seidman. **********For younger children, many tax advisers have been recommending United States savings bonds. With these, parents have the option of deferring taxes on the interest until the bond is redeemed. Savings bonds, which are sold at a discount from their redemption value, mature in 10 years, although the Treasury allows investors to extend the maturity. Some of Bonds' Features **********Even though the guaranteed rate on savings bonds was reduced last week to 6 percent, from 7.5 percent, Mr. Rhine said they remain an attractive investment option for children's accounts. In addition to their tax-deferral feature, interest on the bonds is completely exempt from state and local taxes. **********Furthermore, the 6 percent rate is the guaranteed minimum the bond pays if it is held at least five years. The actual yield may be higher if market interest rates go higher. The rate on savings bonds is adjusted every six months at 85 percent of what five-year Treasury notes yield. **********Mr. Bernard of Coopers & Lybrand predicts that long-term growth stocks will become part of many younger children's portfolios because the income can be deferred until the stock is sold after age 14. Even then, however, the child could end up with a gain so large that he ends up in a higher tax bracket. **********Since younger children will effectively be in the same tax bracket as their parents, Mr. Rhine said, investments that make sense for the parents will often make sense for their children's accounts as well. Municipal bonds are one example. Re-evaluation by Parents **********''If that's their investment fiber, then let the kids go into municipals,'' Mr. Rhine said.  With the tax benefits for transferring assets to younger children so sharply curtailed, Mr. Kuchta of Price Waterhouse said parents need to re-evaluate whether to give as much in the future - particularly if they are concerned about the prospect that the child will have the legal right to do anything with the money upon becoming an adult. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Rhine says there are still advantages to transferring assets to younger children. The first $1,000 a year in income will still be subject to preferential treatment. Savings accumulated when the child reaches 14 will be taxed at preferential rates. And upper-income parents can save on estate taxes by transferring part of their wealth. Each parent can transfer up to $10,000 a year to a child (a couple can give a total of $20,000 a year to each child) without incurring a gift tax. **********As for parents' concerns about what the child will ultimately do with the money, Mr. Rhine said trust arrangements can be made that will ''protect the money from the child and the child from the money.'' Scholarships **********Even parents counting on their children's intellectual or athletic prowess to earn full scholarships will need to set aside some funds for their education. Money will be needed to pay a new tax on scholarships. **********For students seeking degrees, the tax-free status of scholarships and fellowships still applies to amounts required for tuition and course-required fees, books, supplies and equipment. But additional amounts, such as for room, board and incidentental expenses, become taxable. **********Non-degree candidates lose the limited tax exemption they had under the old law. The new provisions apply only to scholarships and fellowships granted on or after Aug. 17, 1986. **********For most students, the extra tax should not amount to more than a few hundred dollars. The portion that is subject to tax is considered ''earned income,'' so students can use their standard deduction to help shield part or all of the scholarship proceeds from tax. **********For example, say a student had $5,000 in taxable scholarship income. If he had no other income, the first $3,000 would be shielded by the standard deduction in 1988. The remaining $2,000 would be taxed at a 15 percent rate, making a total tax bill of $300. **********NEXT: Second incomes and small businesses."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/12/world/baghdad-area-struck-by-an-iranian-missile.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Baghdad Area Struck By an Iranian Missile", "print_headline": "Baghdad Area Struck By an Iranian Missile", "body_text": " **********An explosion rocked this city early today, apparently from an attack by an Iranian surface-to-surface missile. **********The blast came several hours after Iraq said it had repulsed an Iranian ground attack on the southern front. **********Several missiles have struck Baghdad during the war.

By contrast, today's computer-controlled stock trading programs do little more than crunch data at mind-numbing speeds. **********Some expert systems are incorporating other aspects of artificial-intelligence research, such as the ability to understand everyday language. For instance, Le Courtier (French for ''the broker'') is a ''natural language'' stock portfolio advisory service developed by Cognitive Systems Inc. of New Haven for Generale de Banque of Belgium. A customer can seek stock recommendations based on instructions typed into a terminal about how much is available to invest and investment goals. Le Courtier can comment on a particular stock, if queried, or point out, without prompting, other stocks in the same sector that might be a better investment. It can also explain its reasoning and adjust its recommendations in response to a feedback typed into the terminal, such as ''I don't want utility stocks.'' **********The major pioneering effort to bring artificial intelligence to Wall Street is believed to have begun at Lehman Brothers just before its merger with Shearson American Express in 1984. It was in the field of interest rate swaps, whereby one corporate or banking client might exchange its fixed-rate loan obligation for the variable-rate obligation of another institution. **********At one point, Bruce Gras, then a senior vice president, reported that the interest-rate swap system, which could evaluate the terms of one client's loan and the terms for which the client might be willing to swap interest payment obligations, earned $1 million in additional fees over a two-month period. However, the program withered when Mr. Gras left to join Symbolics Inc., a start-up company supplying computers designed for artificial-intelligence work. Shearson will not comment on its current work. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission is now seeking to develop a natural language system that can read financial statements, thus allowing it to automate its analysis and indexing of financial information. The New York Stock Exchange hopes another application will allow its computer surveillance systems to read and take into account news reports in watching for unusual trading activity. **********Despite the rising interest in such developments, many Wall Street data managers see drawbacks. Some complain that expert systems operate too slowly to incorporate rapidly changing market conditions into their ''thinking'' as the changes occur. Others say that efforts to apply artificial-intelligence solutions to problems often end up showing ways to do the same thing with traditional, less costly data processing. **********Most Wall Street firms are turning to outsiders for help. E. F. Hutton, for instance, is working with Teknowledge Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., to put an expert system ''shell'' around existing data networks.

MASLAND & SONS is so small that Nelson's Directory of Wall Street Research does not list a single securities analyst who follows the carpet manufacturing company based in Carlisle, Pa. But small can be beautiful in the stock market. Last week, Masland's little-noticed shares proved this by jumping $29.25, to close at a record price of $68.375, on the American Stock Exchange. **********This run-up came in response to a cash offer by Burlington Industries, the nation's largest manufacturer of textile products, to acquire all of Masland's 1.6 million shares for $68 each, or about $109 million. **********What is the big appeal in Masland? ''Burlington is attracted by Masland's position as a leading supplier of carpeting to the automobile industry,'' said Pamela Singleton of Merrill Lynch. Earlier this year, Burlington sold its sheet and towel operations to J.P. Stevens, thereby netting close to $110 million, or just about what the textile giant has offered to pay for Masland. **********The tender offer by Burlington - a company covered by 11 analysts, according to the Nelson publication - is due to expire June 20. But, as indicated by the slight premium reached last week, and equaled again in yesterday's trading, some investors are apparently betting that $68 a share might not be sufficient to win Masland. The stock closed yesterday at $68. **********Masland's management has urged the 1,122 shareholders of record to take no action on the offer until directors make their recommendation at a meeting expected to take place this week. Masland also said it was reviewing the offer with its legal counsel and with its financial adviser, Goldman, Sachs & Company. The investment firm has built a reputation in similar situations for either bringing in a friendly suitor with a higher offer or else securing a better price from the initial bidder. **********One effect of Burlington's offer for Masland has been ''to draw attention to the rest of the carpet-making industry,'' said Hugh Riley, who follows textile, apparel and home furnishings companies for the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Sales of the largely fragmented carpet business are estimated at $6 billion a year. **********Last Friday, for example, Fieldcrest Mills traded at a record price of $54.875. It closed at $54.625, up $4.50 for the week. Besides being a major producer of bedroom and bathroom textile products, Fieldcrest makes broadloom carpets and Oriental design rugs. The stock finished yesterday at $55, up 37.5 cents. **********Shares of Mohasco Industries, a major furniture manufacturer that also produces carpets and rugs under several brand names, climbed $3 last week, closing at $38.25. The stock closed yesterday at $40.375, up $2.125, after selling at $40.50, its highest price since 1972. **********Shaw Industries, the nation's largest maker of tufted carpeting, has been hitting new highs since its recent 2-for-1 stock split. It finished yesterday at $20.75, up 37.5 cents. **********Among carpet companies followed by Miss Singleton, Shaw Industries is her favorite. ''The company enjoys a strong financial condition, modern facilities and good distribution,'' she said. Moreover, for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1985, Shaw showed a return on equity of 23.1 percent. **********Masland has already formed a joint venture with Hayashi Telempu Ltd. of Japan to market and distribute carpet and trim fabrics to Japanese motor vehicle makers and associated companies in North America. **********In addition to supplying floor, interior trim and trunk parts to the automotive industry - direct sales are made to Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, among other customers - Masland makes tufted and nonwoven carpeting for residential use. Here, too, according to trade sources, the bright prospects for home building in 1986 and increased consumer disposable income promise to give a lift to carpet manufacturers in general. **********Some industry observers see Masland as a worthy prize for Burlington, thanks to sharply improving profits. After losing money in 1982, Masland reported earnings of $1.04 a share in 1983 and $2.12 the following year. In 1985, it earned $3.75 a share from operations. Last spring, the stock traded as low as $16.25. **********For its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1985, Burlington earned 44 cents a share. ''Earnings were penalized by costs incurred to shut or consolidate facilities hurt by imports,'' said Nancy M. McCarter of the Value Line Investment Survey. Burlington's shares rose 25 cents yesterday, to $37.25. In the last 52 weeks, the price has ranged between $24.75 and $40.25. **********Miss Singleton of Merrill Lynch estimates profits for Burlington's 1986 fiscal year at $2 to $2.15 a share, and for the 1987 fiscal year at $2.75 to $3.

But they do not prove that he either ordered or took part in the massacres. **********In two intelligence reports dated Oct. 12, 1944, Mr. Waldheim reported on increased activity by Partisans on the road between the Yugoslav towns of Stip and Kocane. Two days later three villages between Stip and Kocane were burned, the male inhabitants rounded up and shot. **********Mr. Waldheim was certainly aware of the extent of the atrocities against Partisans. In an intelligence report bearing his signature dated Nov. 7, he reported that 739 Partisans - most of them unarmed - were killed and 94 taken prisoner the previous month. Only 13 machine guns, 49 rifles and 1 submachine gun were found. Kept Army Group's Daybook **********German war documents already made public indicate that a year earlier, Mr. Waldheim kept his army group's daybook, which recorded Hitler's order to kill captured Partisans in Greece and send suspected resistance fighters to labor camps. **********''At a minimum what he did was recklessly endanger human life by forwarding reports to his superiors which he had every reason to know would result in atrocities of the kind that subsequently ensued,'' Eli Rosenbaum, legal counsel of the World Jewish Congress and a former prosecutor in the Office of Special Investigations in the Justice Department, said at a briefing for reporters. **********The documents dovetail charges against Mr. Waldheim in a 1947 Yugoslav War Crimes Commission report quoting an eyewitness who said Mr. Waldheim was responsible for the ''reprisal committed on the way between Kocane and Stip in late October 1944, when three villages were burned and 114 people killed.'' The Yugoslav authorities have never released the file, which was disclosed to a Yugoslav newspaper in March. **********That report was used by the 17-member United Nations War Crimes Commission in its conclusion in 1948 that there was enough evidence against Mr. Waldheim for prosecution. **********Mr. Waldheim has never denied knowing about massacres against Partisans, but has stated repeatedly that he neither ordered nor took part in any massacres. Comment by Head of Campaign **********Gerold Christian, head of Mr. Waldheim's campaign for the Austrian presidency, said by telephone from Vienna today, ''It is true that Mr. Waldheim knew the enemy was only Partisans, but he himself wasn't involved in war activities, or in fighting or shooting Partisans.'' **********He called the release of documents today ''an increase of the campaign against him to try to put him nearer to war crimes.'' **********In a detailed statement of his war activities made public last month, Mr. Waldheim said he was withdrawn from command headquarters on the day before the Stip-Kocane massacres, but no documents have come to light to prove his whereabouts. **********The fact that Mr. Waldheim continues to make mistakes about his war past continues to damage his credibility. He also said, for example, that the villages were burned ''around Oct. 20,'' although survivors of the massacres and the official town record of Stip indicate that it happened on Oct. 14. **********''All these things happened 42 years ago, and it's easy for one to change dates by one month, eight days,'' Mr. Christian said in defense of Mr. Waldheim's statement. Bringing Waldheim to Trial **********Officials in the World Jewish Congress said the documents made public today would be helpful in bringing Mr. Waldheim to trial. They called on the Governments of Austria, Yugoslavia and Greece to initiate criminal investigations against Mr. Waldheim. **********''In theory, he could and should be tried in Austria,'' Elan Steinberg, executive director of the congress, said. ''Do I believe that will happen? No.'' Mr. Rosenbaum said Mr. Waldheim could be charged with ''complicity in murder'' if Yugoslavia made public its War Crimes Commission file on Mr. Waldheim. He admitted that the prosecution would be difficult, since the main eyewitness, whom he identified as Capt. Karl-Heinz Egberts-Hilker, was executed for war crimes by Yugoslavia in 1947 or 1948. **********Other experts said the documents did not bring Mr. Waldheim any closer to war criminality. ''He supplied the information on which the massacres were based,'' said Robert E. Herzstein, professor of history at the University of South Carolina. ''He didn't order them. He didn't kill them himself.'' The World Jewish Congress also made public a copy of Mr. Waldheim's personnel form when he was applying for a job in the Austrian Foreign Ministry in November 1945. He is listed as being a member of the ''NS-Reiterkorps,'' or National Socialist mounted unit, on the form, which bears his signature. An order by Hitler established that unit in March 1936 to promote uniform training in horsemanship."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/21/world/khomeini-rules-out-link-with-us-and-assails-iranians-who-seek-ties.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 270, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KHOMEINI RULES OUT LINK WITH U.S. AND ASSAILS IRANIANS WHO SEEK TIES", "print_headline": "KHOMEINI RULES OUT LINK WITH U.S. AND ASSAILS IRANIANS WHO SEEK TIES", "body_text": " **********Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ruled out reconciliation with Washington today, saying any Iranian officials who seek to improve relations are ''Satan-oriented.'' **********''I never expected such things from these people,'' Ayatollah Khomeini, the Iranian religious leader, said of officials who would seek improved ties. **********His remarks, in a speech at his residence in north Teheran, were broadcast by the Teheran radio and monitored in Nicosia. **********''This is a time when they should be screaming at America.

PRESSING BANKS TO MOVE ON TAX CHEATS", "body_text": " **********The Internal Revenue Service, contending that at least 1.1 million Americans have failed to provide their financial institutions with accurate Social Security numbers, has begun a tough enforcement program to combat the problem. **********The I.R.S. believes that problem of inaccurate or missing numbers reflects, at least partly, attempts by individuals to underreport dividend and interest income. Some tax experts say that 1.1 million is a conservative figure and that the real number is many times that. **********Whatever the magnitude of the problem, the I.R.S. is fighting back. According to top tax accountants, the agency recently sent letters to 23,000 financial institutions - banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and brokerages - informing them that in at least 50 instances each, customers had failed to provide the financial institution with a Social Security number or had provided an incorrect one. **********A Question of Diligence **********Not only does the I.R.S. hope to collect overdue taxes, but it also wants to make sure that the financial institutions are diligently attempting to obtain correct numbers. It will seek penalties from the institutions that are unable to certify that they have made such efforts. The accountants became aware of the program when banks that are clients informed them that they had been contacted by the I.R.S. **********The I.R.S.'s contentions are based on its review of forms on which the financial institutions reported to the agency how much interest or dividends a taxpayer earned in 1985. **********The I.R.S. matches information reported on the forms, known as 1099's, with income reported on tax returns. The fact that so many 1099 forms contained either no Social Security number or an incorrect one indicates that tax evasion relating to interest and dividends continues to be a problem, tax experts said. **********''Most of the discrepancies were probably innocent errors, but there are people who give phony numbers, and this I.R.S. program will certainly help track them,'' said Alan L. Kline, a senior tax specialist at Ernst & Whinney, the national accounting firm. **********At the I.R.S., Johnelle Hunter, a spokesman, said: ''In due time, we will go after the people who gave us wrong numbers. We're simply trying to use the tools available to us to improve compliance.'' **********For individuals, knowingly failing to provide a Social Security number or intentionally providing an inaccurate number constitutes the crime of tax evasion. If the discrepancies are found to be innocent errors, the taxpayer will still be forced to pay the tax due, plus penalties and interest. **********If the numbers problem is widespread, the situation could be costly to the financial institutions. Those contacted by the I.R.S. must certify to their diligence in attempting to obtain correct numbers. If they cannot do so, they face a $50 fine for each error the I.R.S. says exists. The Law's Requirements **********Although the I.R.S. lost its legislative battle three years ago to withhold taxes on all interest and dividends, it did get a law passed requiring financial institutions to make a diligent effort on the Social Security numbers. Among other measures, the law requires them to verify that a number has nine digits and to send a letter to customers to confirm a number. **********No one knows how well banks have been complying with the law, because this is the first time that the I.R.S. has attempted on a broad scale to make sure the Social Security numbers are accurate. But tax experts fear that some institutions could end up owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. Nationwide, the I.R.S. has already fined financial institutions $150 million for filing 1099 forms for 1985 late, or for filing them on paper instead of on magnetic tape. **********Moreover, the financial institutions are being asked by the I.R.S. to review their ''due diligence'' efforts just when they are working overtime to get their year-end 1986 tax information in shape. **********''This is hitting the institutions at the worst time of year,'' said Paula Porpilia, a tax specialist at Price Waterhouse, another big accounting firm. **********''I can understand why the banks are upset,'' said Terence E. Kelly of the accounting firm Seidman & Seidman. ''It's a large undertaking to sort all this out.'' Outside Contractors Used **********The I.R.S. program could be particularly hard on small and medium-size financial institutions. Many of them rely on outside contractors to process and maintain paperwork on new accounts. They now must go to their contractors and verify that the proper due diligence work was done. One critical legal question is who will be responsible - a financial institution or its outside processor - if the work was not done properly. **********Many banks, of course, will end up not having to pay fines. Chemical Bank, for instance, said that the I.R.S. had notified it of 3,000 errors involving Chemical customers. But, according to Kenneth Herz, a bank spokesman, Chemical was able to certify its diligence and will not be fined. **********Citibank declined to disclose how many errors the I.R.S. claimed it had, but its spokesman, John Maloney, said Citibank, too, had certified that it had fulfilled its responsibilities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/30/business/us-niche-in-compact-disks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 967, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. NICHE IN COMPACT DISKS", "print_headline": "U.S. NICHE IN COMPACT DISKS", "body_text": " **********When the compact disk arrived on the audio scene three years ago to general fanfare, many of the most demanding hi-fi enthusiasts and many American stereo manufacturers dismissed it. The new medium, they said, fell short of the sonic perfection claimed by its developers, offering a sound that was harsh, strident, ''mid-fi,'' at best. **********But with annual sales of compact disk players approaching $500 million, many former nay-sayers have changed their tune. Several American manufacturers have introduced compact disk players for the high end of the audio market, where sonic excellence, assembly by hand and technical innovation are prized above convenience or economy. **********Foreign companies, particularly the Japanese, already dominate the production of high-end disk players as well as those for the mass market. But American companies, which have traditionally held the high end of the audio business, are moving to meet the foreign challenge. **********''All my manufacturers are looking at C.D.,'' said Eric Hudgens, owner of the Elite Electronics store in Cupertino, Calif. ''They ignored it because they didn't think it would make it, but they can't do that anymore.'' **********The American companies now say they can make disk players that sound better than the average import, but will typically cost more. The Carver Corporation of Lynwood, Wash., and Harman Kardon Inc. of Woodbury, L.I. - relative giants among American audio companies -are having players made to their specification in Japan. Other, smaller domestic manufacturers are assembling players here, using their own audio circuitry but relying on laser and mechanical components from Philips N.V., the Dutch-based electronics concern that was a co-developer of the compact disk with Sony of Japan. **********McIntosh Laboratories Inc. is the nation's oldest high-end audio manufacturer and, with annual sales of more than $10 million, one of the largest. In July, it introduced the first American-made compact disk player. McIntosh's president, Gordon Gow, credits the machine with ending two years of losses for the 40-year-old company, which is based in Binghamton, N.Y. **********''From management's point of view our disk player was two years too late,'' Mr. Gow said. ''But I've always wanted the company's products to excel, and the initial C.D. players were plagued with harsh, strident sound.'' When McIntosh engineers found a way to deal with that harshness, Mr. Gow said he ''jumped on an airplane to Holland and signed a contract with Philips.'' Bucking a Price Trend **********At $1,399, the McIntosh player bucks the downward price trend that has seen retail prices for basic models go as low as $150. But in the high-end audio market, where speakers retail for as much as $35,000 a pair and $150 interconnect cables are not uncommon, price is rarely an obstacle. Spectral, an audio manufacturer based in Cupertino, Calif., will soon introduce a $3,000 disk player. **********Some audio purists still say the sound quality of a conventional analog recording exceeds that of the digitally encoded disk, particularly on complex orchestral music. **********An analog recording creates a continuous model of a musical waveform, while the digital process involves sampling the sound and converting it to a numerical code. Some audiophiles say the subtle details and textures of music get lost between the digits, and the sound, while free of noise and distortion, is not interesting. However, most audio buffs concede that disks generally sound better than conventional records played on an average turntable. **********''The mistake we made was judging the technology of C.D.'s by what we were hearing'' on the early players, said Paul McGowan, president of PS Audio Inc. ''The real problem is that they've surrounded this Buck Rogers technology with parts no better than you find in a Japanese transistor radio.'' **********PS Audio of San Luis Obispo, Calif., makes amplifiers and pre-amplifiers. It has just brought out its first disk player, which has already been dubbed ''the second coming'' by one audio reviewer. Mr. McGowan does not contend his machine will outperform the best turntables, which can cost more than $10,000, only other disk players. ''But for $800, it's very musical,'' he added. Debate Over Survival **********Mr. Hudgens of Elite Electronics said he thinks disk players will ultimately kill sales of high-end turntables, but others are less sure. ''My turntable sales are growing,'' said Ken Gould, owner of the Audio Nexus store in Berkeley Heights, N.J. ''I just sold a $3,200 turntable, arm and cartridge combination. Nobody buys a C.D. player like that.'' **********Robert Becker, president of SOTA Industries in Berkeley, Calif., the United States' largest maker of high-end turntables, said the compact disk had helped his sales. ''It got people into stereo stores again,'' he said. ''Maybe some of them bought disk players, but many others listened and realized that C.D. doesn't perform as well as claimed, and in any case the software available is limited and expensive.'' **********Mr. Becker said that for audio hobbyists there is a ''sense in which you can become a participant in analog in a way you can't in digital. There is a lot you can do to a turntable to refine it to your taste.'' SOTA's turntables, which are priced from $895 to $1,600, come without tone arms and cartridges so that audiophiles can choose their own. **********Still, the approximately one million disk players sold in the United States last year accounted for a major part of the growth in audio sales. The number is expected to double in 1986. **********The marketing potential is also becoming apparent to the makers of amplifiers and speakers, whose products are used in both analog and digital systems. Several speaker manufacturers are now marketing their product as ''digital ready,'' alluding to the increased bass and dynamic range claimed for digital sound."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/business/your-money-buying-stocks-internationally.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1986-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 748, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUYING STOCKS INTERNATIONALLY", "print_headline": "YOUR MONEY; BUYING STOCKS INTERNATIONALLY", "body_text": " **********INVESTING in foreign companies is, virtually by definition, more difficult than investing in American corporations. But for individuals who decide to participate in this category, the potential rewards could be substantially greater than for investors in domestic securities. **********For example, an index prepared by Morgan Stanley & Company shows that the stock market, measured in local currency, last year rose 81 percent in West Germany, 62 percent in Switzerland and 46 percent in Hong Kong. In contrast, the United States market advanced 27 percent, according to the same indicator. **********''Because each stock's performance is linked to the economy in which its firm operates, and because economic cycles differ from country to country, foreign investing offers some extra elements of diversification not available from local invesments,'' said Gerald W. Perritt, president of Investment Information Services. ''The more independently another country's market moves in relation to one's own, the better the diversification obtained by adding that country's securities to one's portfolio.'' **********However, although certain foreign markets may outpace domestic investments, the difficulties in foreign investing require that particular care be taken by individuals seeking higher profits overseas. Accounting systems are often different than those in the United States, spreads between bid and asked price may be wider, quotes are not always easily available and foreign political and economic developments are frequently less predictable than those at home. In addition, foreign companies are not subject to the same disclosure and surveillance requirements as publicly owned companies traded in the United States. **********''It's administratively difficult to invest overseas,'' noted A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. ''Just getting hold of the shares is hard - and then there is getting the dividends and getting the reports.'' **********An investment in a foreign stock, moreover, involves the rate at which the currency of that country can be exchanged for dollars. For when the dollar declines against another country's currency, the dollar value of an investment in that country will advance. And when the dollar rises against another country's currency, the dollar value of an investment in that country will fall. **********Thus an American owner of a British common stock will benefit if the dollar weakens against the pound, and suffer if the dollar strengthens against the pound. **********American depository receipts, or A.D.R.'s, offer a convenient way of investing in foreign corporations. Such receipts for the underlying stock, which remains abroad in the country of origin, are then traded here on a securities exchange or the over-the-counter market. For instance, A.D.R.'s traded on the New York Stock Exchange include Sony, Hitachi and British Telecommunications. **********''An active A.D.R. is good,'' said Nick Walker, a vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''But if it's not an active A.D.R., you might be better off getting your broker to buy it on the local market. Even with the globalization of markets, it's still a very specialized area.'' **********To buy directly in foreign markets, such as London, Paris and Tokyo, big American brokerage firms have branches in those cities, as well as research experts concentrating in particular countries or geographic areas. But investments made in this manner may not be easy to follow - even if large, well-known corporations are involved -since relatively few foreign issues are listed in newspapers and financial publications. **********An indirect way to acquire foreign stocks - and obtain diversification and professional management as well - is by purchasing mutual funds in the United States that invest wholly or partly in these markets. Along with global funds that invest in both foreign and American securities, there are international funds that are fully invested in stocks of foreign companies. **********According to Lipper, the 16 global mutual funds advanced 47 percent and the 18 international mutual funds increased 57 percent in the 12 months ended Thursday. On the other hand, the average gain for all 666 equity funds was 27 percent. **********Similarly, foreign stocks can be bought indirectly through American closed-end investment companies that have foreign securities in their portfolios. There are about half-a-dozen such closed-end funds that specialize in a country or continent, some of which are listed on exchanges in the United States. **********''Discounts and premiums on these funds are based more on expectations than anything else,'' said Thomas J. Herzfeld, head of a South Miami, Fla., securities firm bearing his name.

The seven summit countries - the United States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada and Italy - would try to harmonize the performance of many of the measures of their economies, not merely their exchange rates, to keep the rates within a general range. **********The new system, born of political compromise, will succeed or fail on the strength of the political discipline built into it. It assumes that countries will bring pressure on one whose economic policies run off the track it had previously agreed to follow, and that the pressure will have a positive effect. **********The extent to which the political discipline works will not be clear for a year or more. But the mere commitment is considered an achievement. As a senior American official said today, ''Even if we should not be able to implement this in a way we'd like, we are better off.'' **********However, the countries failed to resolve an insidious problem that could overwhelm their resolve to put their currency plan to work. The problem is their trade and, in particular, the trade of their farmers. Some of the governments say the problem could get much worse, growing into a trade war that would tear apart the political glue needed for the new coordination system to work. A Persistent Problem **********The trade issue has been dogging the summit conferences for several years. Some countries, foremost among them the United States, have been promoting new negotiations involving scores of countries, to chop away at the thicket of barriers that inhibit trade of about half the world's production of goods and services. **********But at the summit conference a year ago in Bonn, France's President, Francois Mitterrand, scotched a plan of the other six leaders to set a date to begin the negotiations. **********This year he did so again and, according to other Europeans here, the British have joined him. In September, the trade ministers of many nations will assemble in Uruguay to discuss free trade, but because of the summit outcome, they will not be able to start the new round, adding to a delay that has become especially troublesome for agriculture. **********The countries involved in these skirmishes have said they share the blame, and they did so formally in the summit communique, the first to treat the politically hot subject of agriculture. They also say the problem will only get worse if they do not work together to reduce their subsidies and trade barriers. **********But at the conference, all that the countries really achieved was a lower level of open recrimination on trade. They not only left the debut of trade talks in doubt but also rejected Mr. Reagan's request to include agriculture among the issues to be negotiated. Early Admission of Defeat **********By contrast, before the conference, the Administration had said it wanted agriculture negotiated on a faster schedule than other issues. But while the United States made setting a date for the talks its overriding objective last year, this time around the Administration saw early that it would not get anywhere. **********''Quite frankly,'' Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d told a news briefing at the end of the conference Tuesday, ''we didn't think that it was, that it would be productive to go through the same experience that we went through in Bonn and end up in the same place.'' **********All the countries limit imports to protect at least some of their farm trade, and all of them subsidize farm incomes when farmers are unable to sell their goods in the world market at competitive prices. **********With the ever-improving technology of farming and with the emergence of such countries as India, China and Argentina, as well as several European nations, as major exporters of farm goods, production far exceeds world demand. Prices have therefore plunged, and, in turn, the costs of subsidizing farm incomes have soared. **********For both the United States and the 12-member European Community, farm subsidies have become one of the biggest components of government spending and a major contributor to government budget deficits. As a result of rising concern over these costs, the issue of subsidies came to the forefront early last winter with the European Community's admission of its newest two members, Spain and Portugal. **********To meet the community's free-trade regulations, the new members must remove their barriers to European farm goods. And to ease their adjustment, the multinational commission that governs the European Community erected barriers to imports of some American farm products, now scheduled to take effect next year. **********The Reagan Administration has vowed to retaliate by imposing restraints of $1 billion worth of products that Europe exports to the United States. The two sides have fought such battles before and reached a compromise, but this time they have dug in deeper than ever before, and in the volume of trade there is more at stake."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/02/business/advertising-drug-free-campaign-gears-up.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 744, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Drug-Free Campaign Gears Up", "print_headline": "Advertising; Drug-Free Campaign Gears Up", "body_text": " **********DESPITE the fact that he is extremely busy putting together the components in the recently formed Omnicom Group, Allen G.

The research will include a benchmark study of the total population as to drug use and attitudes toward drugs in order to create advertising to reach not only users and potential users but also the so-called influencers. **********The same benchmark study will be used six to nine months after the advertising starts running to see if the various advertising campaigns that will be created to reach the different target audiences are having an impact. **********That is the big question.

But with this ticklish assignment there is always the danger of turning kids on to drugs instead of off. **********What gives the Four-A's hope, according to Leonard Matthews, its president, who had joined Mr. O'Reilly in his office, is the seeming effectiveness of the anti-smoking advertising and the early signs of success in the more recent advertising efforts against drunken driving. **********Mr. O'Reilly as well as Mr. Matthews and the rest of the Four-A's leadership believe drug abuse is the country's leading social ill. And in their personal visits to get commitments from the media they are meeting people who agree with them. The three commercial TV networks are already committed to donating time in prime time. The MTV and Nickelodeon cable networks are also giving time.

And the job of lining them up will fall to the local agencies, whose volunteers will discover what the score is in a series of meetings that the Four-A's will hold in New York, Memphis, Chicago and Los Angeles. **********Mr. Rosenshine's creative committee, whose members will include Stuart Upson, chairman of DFS-Dorland and head of the Advertising Council's creative committee, will allocate the various creative assignments to the volunteer agencies. **********Mr. O'Reilly, a lifetime advertising man, was a top executive at N.W. Ayer, SSC&B and Wells, Rich, Greene, and also ran Campaign '80, President Reagan's election agency. He characterizes the anti-drug campaign as the biggest single undertaking of the advertising community since World War II and the founding of the Advertising Council. **********The council ever since has been the public service arm of the industry, creating and placing advertising in the public interest.

Nearly a half-dozen houses in about six blocks of a residential area were blown apart and most of the rest suffered shattered windows, blown-out doors and fallen walls. Damage to Embassies **********One bomb or missile hit within 35 yards of the French Embassy, the blast mangling one side of the building. The nearby residences of the Swiss and Japanese Ambassadors and the Embassies of Austria and Rumania were damaged to lesser degrees. The wife of an Italian diplomat living in the neighborhood was hit by a shard of window glass in the eye, diplomats said. **********The American planes, screeching through a hail of flak in the night and dropping what witnesses said were four or five bombs in this section of Tripoli, apparently missed their target. Standing about 100 yards from the French Embassy was a blackish building with a towering antenna on top and other antennas behind it. **********Western diplomats and knowledgeable residents said the building is the headquarters of the Libyan Intelligence Agency, presumably one of what the White House called a ''command and control center for world terrorism'' that was a target of the raid. **********The building seemed to have little damage. Some windows were blown out, but the antennas were intact, standing next to the rubble of unrelated buildings. Attack Called Terrorism **********To Mr. Gubbia, an American-educated English professor, and his embittered neighbors, the destruction of their homes, though probably a mistake, was terrorism, a strike without warning that killed and wounded innocent people. **********''And these bloody Americans say they don't hit civilian targets,'' Mr. Gubbia, 32 years old, said as he stood, still in his pajamas, on the sidewalk in front of what remained of his home. ''Now you can differentiate between who are the terrorists and who are not.'' **********While the Government kept hidden the damage to military targets near Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya's second city, the Information Ministry was unusually quick to arrange bus trips to the stricken neighborhood here. Reporters arrived as the sun rose not too long after the combat in the night sky over this capital. **********Bin Ashur is made up mostly of the villas and comfortable apartments of Libya's upper-middle class and intelligensia.

They are often admirers of much of the American way of life and among the people that the Reagan Administration had reportedly hoped by its attacks to eventually encourage into revolting. **********Like Mr. Gubbia, many speak fluent English and have studied in the United States. Mr. Gubbia taught at Al Fatah University and said he studied at Georgetown University in Washington. But their ire today was directed at President Reagan.

In the hospital morgue 15 people from the neighborhood were dead. Among them were two infants.

And there is nothing small-scale about the rehabilitation in progress along 52d Street between 18th and 19th Avenues, two or three blocks from the residential heart of the community. **********Years ago these four-story walk-ups were a rental development known as Midwood Gardens. Like innumerable rent-controlled buildings, and walk-ups in particular, they went into precipitous decline in the 1970's. But housing demand in Borough Park endowed the property with resale value. The buildings were purchased for rehabilitation by a development group in 1979 while they were still occupied, and were ultimately vacated for a gut rehabilitation. **********Work was completed on two buildings and they were brought to the sales market as Borough Park Town Houses in 1984 at prices of $70 to $80 a square foot, or $110,000 to $130,000. Current resale prices are said to be about $165,000 to $175,000. **********Though sales were successful, relocation problems with a small number of rental tenants made the project less than a success from the builder's standpoint, and the remaining five buildings, when finally vacated, were sold to a new development group. Now work is at full tilt on three of these buildings - Nos. 1855, 1850 and 1860 52d Street - under the name Borough Park Village. And interior demolition has started at 1900 and 1901 51st Street for reconstruction in a later phase as retirement housing. **********The new owner-developer is a partnership of Prime Resources Group, of which Shmuel Lefkowitz is chairman and Joel Kaplan is president, and Housing Futures Inc., a real estate venture established by Arthur G. Cohen Properties. **********Charles P. Reiss, former director of development of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, is president of Housing Futures. Mr. Lefkowitz is the former executive director of the Southern Brooklyn Community Organization, a nonprofit promoter of housing rehabilitation in Borough Park. **********As Prime Resources Group sees it, the growing Orthodox Jewish population in Borough Park has created a need for more large-sized apartment units in existing buildings. ''The neighborhood has changed to larger families,'' Mr. Lefkowitz said. **********In a design by the Brooklyn firm of Saltini Ferrara Associates, Borough Park Village is converting each of the three buildings into 24 apartments, 16 of them as four-bedroom units, with two elevators per building. Previously each walk-up building had about 50 apartments. **********The apartments are either triplexes (street level, upstairs and basement) or duplexes with a roof garden (two levels of living space on the third and fourth floors). The streetside triplexes have private entrances and run through the building, like a town house, exiting on the building's central interior courtyard at the rear. Other triplexes face the courtyard and run to a private rear yard. The units range from 1,100 to 1,500 square feet, excluding basement space. **********Every apartment has a porch, often used for a succah, where the family dines during the Jewish festival of Succoth. The upper apartments also have roof gardens. **********Private houses in Borough Park are hard to find at prices under $500,000, Mr. Lefkowitz said. At Borough Park Village, four-bedroom apartments run from $245,000 to $325,000. Smaller units are as low as $180,000. **********Prime Resources Group looks upon this as middle-income housing, since most of the buyers are young middle-income families, often getting parental support in their first home-buying venture. **********It is possible that the project and its buyers may not qualify for all the benefits of the city's J-51 tax-incentive program for housing rehabilitation. When the law was revised in the Legislature three years ago, largely through the influence of Manhattan legislators who had Manhattan conditions in mind, projects were disqualified from an exemption from taxes attributable to the post-conversion assessment if that assessment exceeded an average of $38,000 an apartment. **********The law says nothing about apartment size. A small unit in a ''luxury'' Manhattan building is treated the same as a large family unit in Borough Park, although on a square-footage basis the Borough Park assessment might be much lower. **********Prime Resources Group is also developing 40 houses called West Lawrence Estates in Far Rockaway, Queens, two blocks from Nassau County, in partnership with Alex Wagman. And it has purchased 51,000 square feet of land in Bayswater, Queens, for two-family houses. **********The group is ''looking for neighborhoods that are coming back,'' not necessarily religiously oriented neighborhoods, for future activities, Mr. Lefkowitz said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/31/business/intel-expects-profit-in-1986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Intel Expects Profit in 1986", "print_headline": "Intel Expects Profit in 1986", "body_text": " **********The Intel Corporation does not expect to return to profitability until the second half of 1986, its chairman and chief executive, Gordon E.

Politicians, sensing no immediate parliamentary challenge, say this electoral test will most likely occur at the regular general election next year, with the decisive rejection - by a margin of 63 to 37 percent - of the FitzGerald divorce initiative high on the agenda. **********The consensus in political circles, including the Prime Minister's own coalition Government, was that Dr. FitzGerald's considerable reputation ''has been badly dented and the Republic's claim to be regarded as a modern pluralist society has been severely damaged,'' in the words of Dick Walsh, political editor of The Irish Times.

Local Fine Gael workers were widely perceived to have abandoned the divorce issue at the grass roots, leaving Labor workers largely alone in the field against superior forces that included members of the ostensibly neutral Fianna Fail Party and Catholic activists. **********While the church bishops were largely low-keyed in stressing their moral opposition, the issue was more heated on the local level. In Kildare, for example, a parish priest sent schoolchildren home with a letter that asked, ''Would you like your Daddy to walk away forever and leave you an orphan crying in the night?'' **********But at the head of a long list of factors being recited in the referendum's failure, there was the Prime Minister's own political judgment, for all his courage.

Chirac Alludes to Wider Plot **********This analysis tends to be expressed, if obliquely, by politicians like Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, who promised two nights ago to ''punish without pity the assassins and those who manipulate them.'' **********The Prime Minister's spokesman, Denis Baudouin, said of this theory: ''Everything leads us to believe there is an interpenetration between perhaps several groups and that several goals are undoubtedly being sought. **********''We are naming nobody. We think there is an overlapping or encouragement given, perhaps by states, perhaps by groups.'' **********Some 150 plainclothes investigators from France's Judiciary Police are the cutting edge of this old-fashioned hunt for a band of killers. An additional 12,000 police officers from various units have been mobilized to protect public buildings, cinemas, cafes and other establishments against terrorist attacks. **********Coordinating the manhunt for the bombers is Francois le Mouel, a highly regarded police officer who two years ago was designated by a Socialist Government to pull together the badly dispersed French antiterrorist effort, which is given poor grades by North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners. **********''You've got about 15 outfits involved and they never talk to each other,'' said a senior American intelligence officer with considerable antiterrorist experience. ''Their reputation has been terrible.'' **********West German antiterrorist experts say they were shocked by the primitiveness of their French counterparts' methods when, in February 1985, Bonn and Paris initiated close cooperation to meet what seemed a ''Euroterrorist'' threat. The Germans, whose computerized files in Wiesbaden help them track terrorists, had to lend the French computers to make automobile checks. **********Faced with what some political commentators are calling the direst threat faced by the Fifth Republic, the French police have belatedly resorted to methods that were once dismissed as ''too German,'' such as the offer of $150,000 rewards for the arrest of Robert and Maurice Ibrahim Abdallah, brothers of the jailed terrorist chieftain. **********They have also overcome inhibitions arising from the Nazi occupation of France in calling on citizens to supply the authorities with information. ''After making an appeal to the population,'' a senior French investigator said, ''we have been deluged with telephone calls. But we are not naive and we know that some people who have accounts to settle are informing maliciously.'' **********Tracking Down The Brothers Pursuing the thesis that the tightly knit Abdallah clan is responsible for the bombings has embarrassed investigators. After 200,000 posters bearing photographs of Robert and Maurice Ibrahim Abdallah were plastered on walls across France, the pair popped up at a news conference in Lebanon offering to cooperate with the French authorities and denying involvement in the bombings. There has been no official French response to the offer, which police investigators regard as propaganda. **********After the police named another brother, Emile Ibrahim Abdallah, as having been in the black BMW on the Rue de Rennes, a man claiming to be him surfaced in the Abdallah fiefdom in Lebanon saying that he had never set foot in France. **********''It's a campaign of intoxication!'' said one top French investigator, who maintained that it was perfectly possible for the brothers to have deposited their bombs and then absconded to Lebanon by plane - a possibility that raises questions about the efficacity of police surveillance of the airports. ''These people are masters of exploiting the media.'' **********The police insist that the appearance of the three Abdallah brothers in Lebanon was an orchestrated attempt shift attention from the clan. They note that Joseph Abdallah, the oldest brother, used the expression ''yellow Socialists'' in an interview with a French reporter in Lebanon, a term of opprobrium for France's Socialists that appears in communiques issued by the Paris bombers. **********Asserting that several witnesses had independently and positively identified three members of the Abdallah group at two of the terrorist attacks, the police issued a new set of ''wanted'' posters Friday for the four Abdallah brothers and five other Arabs who were described as ''dangerous and could be armed.'' **********There are a few clues. Since a first wave of attacks initiated in December 1985, the terrorists have shown a fondness for targets lying roughly along the axis of the RER, an express subway that links the heart of Paris with its suburbs, suggesting that the metro is an escape route and that safe houses may lie outside of the city. **********It was at one extreme of this axis that on Sept. 12 a young Arab, later identified by a photo-montage as Robert Abdallah, ate lunch at a cafeteria in the suburban office complex known as La Defense; he knocked over a drink, spilling it on himself, and then headed for the lavatory, ostensibly to clean up. Minutes later, a package he left on a seat exploded, wounding 41 people. **********The Abdallah clan's dealings with the French authorities started in Lyons on Oct. 25, 1984, when Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, claiming to be an Algerian engineer named Abdelkader Saadi, showed up at the offices of internal security police, asserting that he was being pursued by Israeli agents. **********But his Algerian identity soon unraveled, and investigators determined that for four years he had been the mastermind of a small Marxist-oriented terrorist band called the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions, whose followers consisted mainly of Maronite Catholic relatives and friends from the northern Lebanese villages of Kobayat and Andakt on the Syrian frontier. Early Links To Syria Born in 1951, Georges Abdallah was a youthful militant in the Syrian Popular Party, a group that regards Lebanon and former Palestine as part of a greater Syria. This allegiance is not as surprising as it might seem, since the Maronites of the Akkar Valley have traditionally sought Syrian protection from more powerful Maronite clans to the south. **********According to various official accounts, Mr. Abdallah - a tall, bearded figure with a melancholy, intellectual air - later joined George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and was active in its deadly ''foreign operations branch,'' led by the notorious Waddi Haddad. **********After Mr. Haddad died of leukemia in Baghdad in 1978, Mr. Abadallah founded the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions. Moving to Europe around 1980, and equipped with a baffling array of passports that to the French suggested links to Syrian intelligence, Mr. Abdallah made contact with the Red Army Faction terrorists in West Germany as well as with the Red Brigades in Italy and Direct Action in France, investigators say. **********With Mr. Abdallah being held on charges of possessing false documents, Lebanese gunmen on March 23, 1985, kidnapped Gilles Sidney Peyroles, the head of the French cultural center in Tripoli, Lebanon. Through Algerian intermediaries, high-ranking French security officials, operating with the blessing of Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, negotiated a swap proposed by the kidnappers, according to various accounts. **********But on April 2, the Paris police raided the four-story apartment building at 18 Rue Lacroix, a rundown street in an outlying, low-income district predominantly populated by immigrant workers. In a third-floor studio apartment used by Mr. Abdallah, they found an arsenal of Czechoslovak-made semtex H explosives, the same brand of explosives that would later be used in the bombings apparently aimed at freeing Mr. Abdallah, according to the police. The Case Grows In Severity But of greater immediate importance were the two Skorpion machine pistols and the CZ 7.65-millimeter automatic pistol found in the arms cache. Forensic experts determined that the Czechoslovak-made automatic pistol had been used in the 1982 asssassinations of Lieut. Col. Charles Ray, the American military attache in Paris, and Yaacov Barsimontov, a second secretary at the Israeli Embassy. The killings were two of eight operations - seven in France and one in Italy - for which the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions publicly took responsibility between 1981 and 1984. **********With Mr. Peyroles freed from Lebanon (he later identified Maurice and Robert Abdallah as having been among his captors in Tripoli), the discovery of the arms cache significantly increased the gravity of the case against Georges Abdallah. The Socialist Government reneged on its apparent agreement to free him. According to the police theory, the Abdallah clan felt betrayed, and on Dec. 7, 1985, it opened hostilities with a pair of bombings in two Paris department stores that wounded 35 people. **********It was not until a third bombing on Feb. 3 this year that a shadowy Committee of Solidarity with Arab and Middle Eastern Political Prisoners -which the police describe as a front for the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions - made its appearance, taking responsibility for a shopping arcade blast on the Champs-Elysees that wounded eight people. **********The new group demanded the release not only of Mr. Abdallah but also of two other jailed terorists. One of them was Anis Naccache, a one-time representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Teheran who was convicted of trying to murder the former Iranian Prime Minister, Shapur Bakhtiar, in Paris in 1980; the other was Waroujan Garbidjan, an Armenian convicted of a 1983 bombing at Orly Airport in Paris. **********In late 1985, Foreign Minister Dumas was conducting delicate negotiations for the release of four French hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian terrorists. At the center of these talks was a deal to free Mr. Naccache in an exchange. So when the first bombs began exploding in Paris, the police initially thought they were intended to put pressure on the French Government to release Mr. Naccache. **********But on March 20, Nabil Dagher, a suspected member of the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions, was killed apparently trying to plant a bomb at a cafeteria on the Champs-Elysees. It began to appear that the Lebanese Factions, aware that the hostage negotiations were at an advanced stage, was trying to link Mr. Abdallah's freedom with the apparently imminent freedom of Mr. Naccache. **********Earlier this week, in an interview with Le Matin, Antoine Comte, the attorney for Mr. Naccache, said his client's cause had nothing to do with the terror campaign. Mr. Comte said that after the bombings in February, Mr. Naccache sent him a telegram condemning them as ''blind acts'' that were ''against the principles of Islam'' and saying that he had never heard of the group that was demanding his release. **********If Mr. Naccache's continued presence on the committee's list of demands is simply a tactical ploy, the terrorists, as one high police official put it, may be only trying ''to confuse public opinion'' and to suggest that they have the support of Iran when they may not. The official said the investigation was centered on ''elements of the Arab left,'' which would seem to exclude Islamic fundamentalists who look to Iran for guidance. **********The first wave of bombings ended spectacularly with the March 20 blast, which coincided with the swearing-in of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's Government after the triumph of a rightist coalition in elections four days earlier. Mr. Chirac had committed himself to a tough stand against terrorism. **********The United States Enters the Case A kind of truce then set in. Concerned that the Chirac Government might be negotiating another deal to free Mr. Abdallah, the United States in July took the exceptional step of becoming ''partie civile'' in the case - a legal maneuver that permitted the United States Government, by virtue of its interest in the killing of Colonel Ray, to examine the dossier, add to its evidence and call for an appeal. **********The American action, which irritated the French, was motivated by a surprisingly lenient sentence against Mr. Abdallah five days earlier in Lyons. Although he was suspected of involvement in the murders of Colonel Ray and Mr. Barsimontov, Mr. Abdallah was sentenced only to four years for criminal association, illegal possession of weapons and false documents. **********After a United States Embassy spokesman condemned the lightness of the sentence, the new Foreign Minister, Jean-Bernard Raimond, summoned the American Ambassador, Joe Rogers, to protest a ''regrettable interference'' in French internal affairs that impugned the independence of the judiciary. Threats of Attacks On 'America's Streets' **********Two days ago in Beirut, the daily An Nahar published a long communique from the Committee of Solidarity that said that in May the French Government had ''sent an envoy to negotiate with us.'' **********The communique asserted that the French envoy had offered ''a truce'' until the end of July, ''promising to end the matter by then.'' **********''We said: 'Take another month. But should the French Government renege on its promise, our answer would be harsher than in previous times,'' said the statement, which also criticized the Reagan Administration and the Italian Government. Two suspected Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions members are imprisoned in Italy. **********''We shall get acquainted with your cities, skyscrapers and Statue of Liberty,'' the message said. ''America's streets will soon know about us.'' **********Mr. Baudoin, the spokesman for Mr. Chirac, denied that there had been negotiations with the Committee of Solidarity in Lebanon, recalling that the Prime Minister had always insisted that any negotiations would be ''state-to-state'' and not with terrorist bands. ''If they took place,'' Mr. Baudouin said of the purported talks, ''I don't know about them. But I deny it.'' **********Whatever the truth about contacts between Paris and Mr. Abdallah's partisans, the uneasy truce did not last beyond the ''extra month'' mentioned in the Beirut communique. On Sept. 4, 50,000 Parisians were evacuated from the metro after a bomb failed to go off; four days later, the explosion in the Hotel de Ville killed a woman and injured 18 people. **********The terrorization of Paris had resumed - with redoubled savagery."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/24/business/briefs-338986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 223, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** AEL Industries, Montgomeryville, Pa., said its board had authorized the purchase of up to 500,000 shares of its common stock.

The substance is more than 90 percent air, with the rest a fibrous material no thicker than paper. Yet, in some ways it is many times stronger than steel. **********The substance is a honeycomb, a structure made of closely spaced hexagonal cells as in a beehive. Except perhaps for bees themselves, Hexcel has become the world's master of honeycomb, which is now widely used in wing flaps, floors and furniture in aircraft. **********''Everything that flies in the free world with two engines or more has our material,'' said Robert L. Witt, the president and chief executive of the company. Materials Replacing Metal **********Hexcel is also among the leaders in other materials, known as advanced composites, that are increasingly replacing metal in the bodies of planes. As aircraft manufacturers turn to advanced materials to reduce weight and save fuel, Hexcel's business has taken flight. **********''They're really riding a tiger by the tail,'' said Alan Benasuli, aerospace analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert. **********Hexcel's net income in 1985 increased 31 percent, to $7.7 million, or $1.89 a share. Revenues rose 30 percent, to $235 million. In 1986, analysts expect the company to report earnings of $2.30 to $2.40 a share and revenues of $285 million. Next year analysts expect earnings of $2.75 to $3 a share and revenues of more than $300 million. The company's stock, which has ranged between $45.875 and $26.375 in the last 52 weeks, closed today at $39.25, unchanged. **********One of the major reasons for the gains is that the Boeing Company, Hexcel's largest customer, is experiencing a boom in demand for planes. Moreover, each new plane contains more honeycomb and composite materials than earlier generations. The new Boeing 767 has about $600,000 worth of such materials, compared with $60,000 worth in the older 727. Founded in 1948 **********Hexcel was founded as California Reinforced Plastics in 1948 by engineers from the University of California at Berkeley. While the company did not invent honeycomb materials, it quickly became a pioneer in commercializing them. **********Honeycomb can be made of any material that can be rolled in sheets, such as aluminum, fiberglass or Nomex, a Du Pont synthetic fiber material from which the honeycomb in the Voyager is made. Normally, the honeycomb is sandwiched between two pieces of metal, plastic or composite material. **********The idea is not much different from that of a corrugated box. The cells in the honeycomb support one another in such a way that a honeycomb sandwich can have many times the stiffness and strength as a piece of metal of the same weight. **********Honeycomb also crushes at a uniform rate without rebounding, so it makes a good energy-absorbing material for such things as bumpers for California's highway department vehicles. The first thing to touch the moon - the foot pad of the lunar module - was made of honeycomb to compress evenly as the craft landed. Rail Cars and Skis **********Honeycomb material is also used in railway cars and by the Navy, Ships are being constructed of lighter-weight materials as they must carry more electronic equipment. Honeycomb material is also used in skis, including some sold under the Hexcel name. **********Hexcel once made the skis itself but sold the business in 1979. Still, if Hexcel has any consumer recognition at all, it is as a ski company. **********Honeycomb now accounts for 45 percent of Hexcel's sales and more than 70 percent of its profits. Its two major competitors are American Cyanamid and Ciba-Geigy. **********Still, honeycomb is considered a niche market. It is expensive to use and water can get in the holes, causing corrosion. **********Far more of the future belongs to composite materials. These are made out of fibers, such as graphite fibers, that are usually woven into sheets. The sheets are saturated with a gooey resin and heated. The result is a very strong yet lightweight material. **********In the future, entire aircraft frames might be made of such materials. In particular, military aircraft, like the Stealth bomber, are made largely of composites because such materials are more difficult to detect on radar than metals. Sales Growing **********Total sales of advanced composites in the United States were $150 million last year and are growing at 12 to 15 percent annually, according to Joseph McDermott, president of the Composites Services Corporation, a Demarest, N.J., consulting firm. **********In this market, Hexcel faces a number of strong competitors, led by Fiberite, a division of Britain's ICI, and Hercules. It has not done nearly as well in composites as it has in honeycomb. **********''Hexcel has a very poor reputation in terms of marketing,'' said Jack White, consultant with Composite Market Services, a San Diego market research firm. **********Moroever, Hexcel has not done nearly as well in the military business as it has in commercial aviation. Military business now accounts for just $20 million of its revenues, according to Carol Neves, analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company. Hexcel is trying to change that and has set up a special unit to pursue contracts from classified projects, such as the Stealth bomber. **********Hexcel is ''having problems in the new programs,'' said William J. Murray, general manager of engineered materials for Cyanamid, a Hexcel competitor. ''There have been selections that have been made in the past six months to a year that they have not been a party to,'' said Mr. Murray, who said he could not discuss the contracts in question because they were classified. A Hands-On Manager **********Increasing Hexcel's military business is just one of the priorities of Mr. Witt, a lawyer by training, who took over as chief executive in July from Harvie M. Merrill. Mr. Merrill had held that post for 17 years and remains chairman of the board. **********Mr. Witt, 46, is considered more of a hands-on, by-the-numbers manager than Mr. Merrill, who is described as the gregarious salesman type with a background in chemistry. **********Mr. Witt wants to increase revenues to $500 million by 1990 and, more important, to raise profit margins to at least 5 percent after tax. ''I will sacrifice sales growth for profit increases,'' he said. **********One way will be by divesting the company of units that do not fit in with the main lines of business. The company sold or is in the process of divesting itself of its medical businesses, including one that makes casts for broken bones. While Hexcel pioneered in new technology for casts, it was outsold by such giants as Johnson & Johnson and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. **********The company will, however, keep its small specialty chemicals division, which makes resins for composites as well as ingredients for such household products as Scope mouthwash and Alka Seltzer. Some Acquisitions **********The company is also trying to make aircraft parts out of its materials, which brings more profits than simply selling the raw materials. And it is trying to strengthen its technology base in advanced materials through acquisitions of companies with expertise in such areas as ceramics. **********Some analysts say, however, that Hexcel itself might be a takeover target, particularly for a big chemical company that wants to get into the composites business. Hexcel is the only major independent company in the advanced materials business at a time when aerospace companies are becoming attractive takeover targets. **********There have already been a major series of acquisitions in the composites business.

Drop in Political Killings **********Some killings and disappearances continue to occur, and there are also cases of indiscriminate air attacks on civilians by the Government. **********But politically motivated killings have fallen from an estimated 800 a month in 1980 to probably fewer than 30 a month, several of which appear to be carried out by leftist rebels. **********Rebel violations include an increasing number of summary executions, attacks on civilian road traffic, dozens of kidnappings and the indiscriminate use of land mines, which probably kill and wound as many civilians as does bombardment by the army, or more. **********The Government's greatest failing, according to diplomats, human rights officials and prisoners, appears to be in the continuation of physical, psychological and sexual abuse of political prisoners that falls short of inflicting severe physical injury. **********The Government also appears to have been unable, and perhaps unwilling, to prosecute any of the major cases of documented human rights violations by army officers and extreme rightists that took place in the past. **********In contrast to the frequency of disappearances in the past, people arrested now by Government security forces almost always turn up in jail or are released, according to foreign diplomats, human rights investigators and political prisoners. **********''If you look at where the Government started, it's pretty incredible what they've achieved,'' said one human rights official who knows the country well. ''But there is a very thin layer of decency. They may be trying to behave, but abuses go on.'' Prisoners Mistreated **********Those abuses appear to include mistreatment of prisoners. Highly reliable Government and diplomatic officials estimate that 20 percent of the political detainees suffer some form of significant abuse after arrest. The treasury police and the national guard appear to be the worst offenders, according to testimony from several political prisoners and from human rights workers. **********Reports of Government mistreatment of political prisoners were given credence in 15 interviews in recent weeks with prisoners and foreign diplomats. They gave detailed accounts of physical beatings, death threats, psychological torture, sexual abuse, and use of hoods to blindfold and disorient political prisoners. **********The army press office and senior army commanders have repeatedly denied accounts of abuse of prisoners. **********The issue of human rights is so politically charged in El Salvador that it is difficult to find neutral observers who might offer a fair assessment of violations by the Government and the guerrillas. **********The United States Embassy relies on local press reports, which consistently underplay Government abuses, especially killings of civilians by the army and air force in the countryside. **********The Human Rights Office of the Roman Catholic Church relies on sworn testimony from those who say they have witnessed abuses. But there is nothing to prevent the guerrillas from sending supporters to report an abuse that never happened. Figures Cannot Be Verified **********In what appears to be an especially unrealistic figure, the church human rights office reported that the army killed an estimated 1,045 people last year, most of them believed to have been civilians. **********The number seems highly exaggerated at a time when no army massacres have been reported for two years, and when two trips by several reporters into the worst war zones, in the departments of Morazan and Chalatenango, found fewer than 10 civilians killed by aerial bombing last year. **********When asked to support the figure with evidence, an official of the church human rights office said it was ''a guess'' based on ''press reports and other sources.'' A reporter could find no such reports or sources. **********Another notable aspect of reporting about human rights in El Salvador is that abuses by the Government appear to get far more attention than abuses by the guerrillas. An Account of Rape **********Still, abuses by the Government are not difficult to encounter. At the Ilopango Women's Prison last week, Yesenia del Carmen Flores, 22 years old, who was imprisoned after being accused of being a guerrilla, described being raped for two hours by five soldiers from the La Union army base after they arrested her last October. **********Ten of 75 women prisoners in the Ilopango prison say they were sexually abused by the police or army after their arrest. **********Eight other political prisoners in Ilopango and the Mariona prison for men, in lengthy interviews, gave credible accounts of abuses during interrogation. Air Attacks Described **********There also continue to be credible accounts of indiscriminate air attacks by the Government on civilian supporters of the guerrillas. Such reports are difficult to verify, but there appears to have been heavy bombardment recently in the southern rebel-controlled areas of the department of Cabanas. **********One refugee asked that her name not be used, but her account seemed especially credible because she was recovering in a hospital from a machine-gun wound in her leg. She said an army helicopter had strafed her in La Cruz. **********Abuses by leftist guerrillas appear to be rising. Indiscriminate use of land mines by them is believed to have killed and wounded more than 100 civilians this year, making it one of the major causes of civilian casualties. **********The rebels are estimated to have carried out 50 kidnappings in the eastern war zone this year, according to two highly reliable non-Government sources who monitor area. Summary Executions Reported **********Among the most serious human rights violations that the rebels appear unwilling to acknowledge are numerous summary executions that appear to be carried out, as a policy, against those suspected of being Government informers. **********Exact statistics are difficult to verify, but the church human rights office says guerrilla executions more than doubled last year, from an estimated 26 killings in 1984 to 66 in 1985.

In several cases, workers in their 70's were forced to retire late last year, just before the effective date of the law that would have protected them from mandatory retirement, no matter what their age. **********The most publicized of these cases involved 28 people, including doctors and faculty members, at the New York Medical College in Westchester County. Two of them have sued the college, asserting that the action violated their employment contracts. They have won the right to keep working until a state court rules on their motion to stop the school from forcing them out. The judge is expected to rule on the case this month. **********Lawyers who specialize in employment matters say they have heard scattered complaints from workers at a variety of institutions who were forced into retirement late last year. In many cases, however, the lawyers say that the actions were probably lawful. Since employers were allowed to retire workers aged 70 or over until Jan. 1, the lawyers say, why should there be any basis for a legal claim just because it was put off until close to the deadline? **********''I can't see how a law that goes into effect Jan. 1 can apply to something that happened before then,'' said Peter Panken, a New York lawyer who represents employers. ''I got a couple of calls from employers who wanted to know what was the safest time to get rid of somebody, and I told them that to avoid age discrimination claims, it was probably safer to do it before Jan. 1.'' **********Lawyers who represent workers say that, as a matter of fundamental fairness, workers should have some legal recourse. ''If people were already working past the age of 70, so the company's mandatory retirement rules were not being enforced, it does seem unfair and in bad faith to make them retire just to stop them from getting the protection of the new law,'' said one lawyer who represents workers and asked not to be identified. ''I think it's at least worth a try in the courts.'' **********Some lawyers suggest another approach. Since employment discrimination on the basis of age is illegal, they say that any employee who was forced to retire, even years ago, can simply reapply for the old job, and force the employer to either rehire the retired employee or find some reason unrelated to age for not doing so. **********In fact, one of the legal complaints by the two doctors retired from the New York Medical College is that the college refused to consider rehiring them after the law went into effect on Jan. 1. **********Under the new law, the only workers who may still be forced to retire because of age are tenured university professors, a few high policy-making executives with pension benefits of $44,000 or more, and those, such as police, for whom age is an established factor in job performance. **********''It's still too soon to say how much litigation the new law is going to spawn,'' said the lawyer who represents workers. ''I don't think most companies are going to leap to hire a 71-year-old. So over the next few months and years, I expect to see at least a small rise in age discrimination litigation. So far, though, the people having the worst age discrimination problems have not been the very old workers, but the managers in their 50's and 60's who are being cleared out to make room for younger people.'' **********Indeed, because most workers retire long before they are 70, the new law ending mandatory retirement has been a non-event for most employers. **********''We sent out a notification to our personnel people, but I haven't heard of anybody having any problems with it or even any questions about it,'' said Vance Anderson, a lawyer at the Mobil Corporation. ''The law doesn't have much effect on us since a very high percentage of our retirements are before age 65.'' **********At the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, too, the new law caused little reaction because it affected so few workers. ''I don't have exact figures now, but a year ago, only 50 of our 340,000 workers were 69 years old,'' said Allyson Liedtke, who manages the company's retirement benefits. She estimated that there were now about 10 workers over 70 at A.T.&T. **********While there is a definite trend nationwide toward the elimination of mandatory retirement - in the last eight years, 13 states have banned forced retirement - fewer and fewer people are working even as long as the traditional retirement age of 65. **********According to a study by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, the average private-sector worker retires at 62, and, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average retirement age has been dropping ever since the Government began keeping records 50 years ago. **********''The two things, early retirement and the end of mandatory retirement, really go together,'' said Lawrence Friedman, a law professor at Stanford University who has studied retirement and age discrimination. ''What is developing instead is a less rigid view of what a career is, replacing the idea that it's something that goes exactly until the 65th birthday.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/05/world/200000-hear-pope-in-india-s-northeast.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1986-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 715, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "200,000 HEAR POPE IN INDIA'S NORTHEAST", "print_headline": "200,000 HEAR POPE IN INDIA'S NORTHEAST", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II traveled to this hill town today, nearly 360 years after the first Christian missionaries braved headhunters and disease to make the initial forays into India's distant northeast. **********The Pope, in the fourth day of his journey through India, arrived to a flag-waving welcome from tens of thousands of enthusiastic Catholic tribespeople and others who lined the streets of the city, sang and danced to honor him. **********''When the first missionaries came to this region they encountered great varieties of people and cultures that were quite unfamiliar to them,'' the Pope said, referring to the diverse racial and cultural groups of the region. Gospel Said to 'Coexist' **********''The early missionaries zealously implanted the Gospel message into each cultural milieu,'' the Pope said. That message, he said, now coexists throughout the region ''in harmonious dialogue with local traditions.'' **********Tonight, the Pope traveled on to Calcutta, where he told a gathering estimated at 200,000 that while Christians should respect the faiths of others, they should preach their message ''with clarity and conviction.'' **********In Calcutta, John Paul continued to praise the faith of the East. But whereas his emphasis until today had been largely on respect for other faiths, the Pope made clear that dialogue should not keep Catholics from seeking to bring others into the Christian fold. **********''It is the fundamental mission of the church to proclaim the good news of the redemption,'' the Pope said. Diverse Audience in Shillong **********In Shillong, many people in the audience of 200,000 had traveled great distances to hear the Pope. They spoke as many as a dozen languages and dialects as they spread out under scattered trees or sat under a pleasant sun. **********One man, identified by a parish priest as Abraham Neamki, wore the battle dress of the former headhunting tribe Konyaks - a red and black vest over a short loincloth, a machete and shield and a feather on a headband. Mr Neamki, who converted in 1984, said he had ''taken'' his last head in 1967. **********Headhunting is now banned, and missionaries and British and Indian officials are credited with helping to end the practice. **********Many in the audience did not understand the Pope's homily, which was delivered in English and translated into the Khasi language of the region around Shillong, more than 300 miles northeast of Calcutta. But that did not seem to matter to them. **********''We have come for his blessing, to see him, to pray with him and for him,'' said Michael Tirkey, who traveled in a bus with 72 others from a village in northern Assam, ''and we have been able to do just that.'' **********The tribespeople of the northeast, a region of 26 million people, have the high cheekbones and Mongolian features of people of Southeast Asia, where many of their ancestors came from. The Khasis are a wandering tribe from Cambodia, and their language is a Cambodian dialect. Their women dress in the sarongs and tops familiar in Southeast Asia. Western Fashions Popular **********The missionaries brought the Bible and education to the tribes. Many tribespeople, especially the younger generation, speak and write English fluently, They are quick to imitate Western fashions and follow the pop and rock music trends of the West. **********Shillong, which has a population of 200,000, is renowned in India for its bracing weather, Catholic schools, colleges and hospitals. **********Those here who were perhaps the most encouraged by the visit of the Pope were hundreds of foreign and Indian priests, some of whom have spent a lifetime here in education and religious work. **********''It encourages us, it helps us to go on,'' said the Rev. Carmel Muscat of the Pope's visit. Father Muscat, an Italian who is a member of the Salesian order, has lived in Shillong for 31 years. **********The Pope praised the early efforts of the missionaries to win converts in this region of thick jungle, fertile farm land, rugged hills and vast rivers.

The controversy over the ousted minister, Masayuki Fujio, not only continues but also seems likely to cast long shadows over future domestic debate and foreign perceptions of Japan. **********The Prime Minister must still deal with bruised feelings in South Korea, where he may encounter anti-Japanese protests when he visits this weekend for the start of the Asian Games. Japanese Rightists Protest **********Closer to home, he has ignited the wrath of conservative elements unhappy that Mr. Fujio was forced out of the Cabinet. **********In the last few days Tokyo streets have been awash with the trucks of right-wing extremists, convoys of men blaring nationalist slogans and martial music wherever they go. These trucks are a common sight in the capital. But their numbers have been unusually high of late, as khaki-clad men travel about announcing their displeasure at high decibels. **********Last Friday night, several hundred people rallied in Tokyo, also to denounce Mr. Nakasone for the Fujio incident. According to press accounts, they included half a dozen Members of Parliament, one of whom attacked the Prime Minister for making ''concession after concession'' to foreign governments. **********That man, Takeo Hiranuma, leads an association of 18 Members of Parliament from Mr. Nakasone's own party who banded together this summer to protest what they regard as a pattern of Japanese ''groveling'' in the face of ''interference'' from overseas. Accusations of Spinelessness **********Their contention is that Japan has abandoned its sovereignty by apologizing too often for its past, especially its behavior before and during World War II. For that matter, they say, the country yields too readily to foreigners on trade and related matters. **********For other Japanese, the argument centers more on whether Mr. Nakasone, a strong nationalist himself, created a climate in which Mr. Fujio felt free to make remarks generally acknowledged as insulting to Koreans and Chinese. The Prime Minister selected Mr. Fujio, these people say, knowing fully that his pro-Japan opinions bordered on the extreme. **********''Fujio was merely stating bluntly what many others also felt but would not dare to voice in public,'' said Keitaro Oguri, a senior political writer for the newspaper Asahi Shimbun. **********The Education Minister's basic position is that Japan is unfairly vilified for its wartime behavior and that it was no worse in its occupation of Asian countries than Western colonial powers. At the ministry, he insisted that Japanese schools fly the national flag and play the national anthem, a demand fraught with symbolic significance here. Interview Caused Uproar **********Matters reached a crisis point last week when a monthly magazine, Bungei Shunju, published an interview in which Mr. Fujio virtually dismissed Japanese atrocities in China in 1937 and insisted that Korea bore responsibility for its annexation by Japan early in this century because supposedly it had agreed to the action. **********China protested, but Koreans were the most agitated. For them, Japan's colonial rule of their country from 1910 to 1945 was the most humiliating chapter in their history. They had ''agreed'' to the annexation only at gunpoint. **********In the ensuing uproar, editors at Bungei Shunju accused Masaharu Gotoda, the Chief Cabinet Secretary and main Government spokesman, of seeking censorship by asking that portions of the interview be deleted. Mr. Gotoda denied any wrongdoing. **********As protests mounted, Mr. Nakasone asked Mr. Fujio to resign. When the minister refused, on the ground that quitting would be an admission he had behaved improperly, he was dismissed. Three days later, the Prime Minister offered a personal apology to the South Korean Government. Gauging Nationalist Sentiment **********But the dispute lingers, and it inevitably raises questions about whether Japanese in general want to excuse their aggression of the 1930's and 1940's. It is difficult, however, to measure how representative Mr. Fujio is. In the main, Japanese, especially younger ones, seem little interested in politics, preferring instead to concentrate on enjoying their new prosperity. **********Some people have expressed revulsion over the ousted minister's views, but it is also clear that he does not speak only for himself. Controversies over Japanese revisions of their history in officially sanctioned textbooks attest to the persistent strain of nationalism here. **********Then there are questions about Mr. Nakasone, inarguably the most successful Japanese leader in many years. In his early political days he was a firebrand nationalist, attacking the United States military occupation and demanding revisions in the war-renouncing Constitution that the Americans imposed. **********A senior member of the Prime Minister's faction insists that Mr. Nakasone has ''grown and matured'' over the years.

Byrd of West Virginia, who will become leader of the Democratic majority in the next Congress, strongly opposes a special session, as does Representative Jim Wright of Texas, who will become Speaker in the next Congress.

''We hope to achieve a complete and comprehensive record of the facts, so the information could be available in one place,'' Mr. Wright said. **********Representative Robert H.

Special Panels Often Used **********Congress has often used special committees to investigate highly complex or publicized matters. The most famous panel in recent years examined the Watergate scandal in 1973, but other select panels since then have studied the connection of President Carter's brother, Billy, to Libyan leaders, and the involvement of Congressmen in the Abscam scandal. **********President Reagan expressed support for a unified Congressional investigation earlier this week. From the Administration's standpoint, a unified investigation would make its job of providing testimony and collecting information much easier than dealing with a group of committees. **********While the plans for the unified committees are going forward, individual panels that have already started their work will continue their inquiries this month. **********The Senate intelligence committee took four hours of testimony today from Robert M. Gates, deputy director of Central Intelligence, and the committee expanded its preliminary investigation for an additional week. ''It's expanding because of the value of testimony we're getting from the witnesses,'' David F. Durenberger, the chairman, said. **********Next week, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Robert C. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, are scheduled to testify on the arms transactions before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Cabinet Level Officers **********Senator Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican, said today that his committee had made ''tentative decisions'' to call Cabinet level officers. **********''I said Cabinet level because there are other people at the N.S.C. that are involved,'' Mr. Durenberger said, referring to the National Security Council. ''It doesn't include the President or Vice President. It includes everyone else.'' **********He would not be more specific about what he meant by ''involved.'' **********The N.S.C. includes the director of Central Intelligence, Secretary of State, White House chief of staff, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The committee has thus far not called anyone not in a position to provide information. **********Leaders discussed forming a single committee combining members from both houses, but that proposal proved too cumbersome. In addition, senior lawmakers in the House were worried about preserving power and prerogatives on a committee that would probably be dominated by the Senate. **********Such a joint committee, Mr. Wright said, would ''create more problems than it would solve.'' Dissenters End Objections **********Some senior House committee chairmen objected to the whole idea of a unified panel and wanted to pursue their own investigations. **********Earlier this week, Mr. Wright said these committees each had a ''rightful claim'' to jurisdiction over the Iran matter, but today he said that the dissenters had ended their objections and were now ''singing from the same hymn book.'' **********In the Senate, Mr. Byrd and Mr. Dole agreed on an 11-member committee, with 6 Democrats and 5 Republicans. In addition, two nonvoting members, one from each party, would have the right to participate in the panel's deliberations. These ''ex-officio'' members would probably be the two leaders. **********Staff aides from both parties have already started drafting legislation to create the Senate committee, and the leaders agreed that the members would be announced no later than Dec. 15. The panel would have no authority to hire staff or issue subpeonas, however, until it is formally created by a Senate resolution. Leaders Considered **********A number of names have surfaced on Capitol Hill as possible candidates for the chairmanship of the Senate committee. They include Howell Heflin of Alabama, a former state court judge; George J. Mitchell of Maine, a former Federal judge; Sam Nunn of Georgia, the incoming chairman of the Armed Services Committee; David L. Boren of Oklahoma, a former governor and the new chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, the third-ranking Democrat. **********One Democratc strategist suggested that Mr. Byrd is likely to pick someone like the late Sam Ervin, the North Carolinian who presided over the Watergate panel. That would argue for a conservative Southerner with a broad legal background, a description that probably fits Mr. Heflin more closely than the others. **********In the House, the committee will consist of 15 members, 9 Democrats and 6 Republicans. Five of the Democrats will be the chairmen of major committees with jurisdiction over segments of the Iran issue: Peter W. Rodino Jr. of New Jersey, Judiciary; Les Aspin of Wisconsin, Armed Services; Dante B. Fascell of Florida, Foreign Affairs; Jack Brooks of Texas, Government Operations; and Louis Stokes of Ohio, who will replace Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana as chairman of the Intelligence next month. **********Mr. Hamilton, who commands wide respect within the House, is often mentioned as a possible chairman of the new select committee. **********Mr. Michel said the senior Republicans on each of the five panels would probably also serve on the committee, but he had yet to sound them out.

But that does not satisfy Meyer S. Frucher, the president of the public development agency that oversees the project that lies along the lower edge of Manhattan's Hudson River shore. He wants to nearly double it.  Like most successful land developers, Mr. Frucher, president and chief executive of the Battery Park City Authority, never stops dreaming up ways to start his next great project. He always wants more land to develop, more office towers to build and more people to live in the communities he creates. **********He may never succeed in transforming all of his dreams into bricks and mortar, but some of them, at least, are beginning to appear in the form of architect's renderings, and others are being studied by the dozens of committees and boards that would have to approve them. **********First Project Derails **********The first dreamer involved in Battery Park City was Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, who in the 1960's conceived it as a state-sponsored new town to be built on land formed by filling in the shoreline with the excavations from the World Trade Center. To carry out the plan, the legislature created an authority to float a $200 million bond issue to pay for the land filling and prepare the site for construction, but the project was then derailed for more than a decade by the near bankruptcy of both the city and the authority. **********In 1979, as the city emerged from the crisis, the authority finally began to convert the barren, 92-acre landfill into a dazzling complex of office and apartment towers, leasing sites to private developers who were forced to conform to a strict master plan. **********Today, although only half finished, Battery Park City ranks as a stunning financial and architectural success. It includes the $2.5 billion World Financial Center, a four-building office complex of 6 million square feet that serves as headquarters for Merrill Lynch & Company, Dow Jones & Company, the Home Insurance Company, American Express Company and Oppenheimer & Company. **********Nearly 4,000 apartments have been completed or are under construction, and work will start early next year on 1,700 more, with 8,300 to come later, making the financial district a residential neighborhood again for the first time since the 1800's. Profits for State **********If Governor Cuomo halted work at Battery Park City right now, the complex Mr. Frucher oversees would still produce tens of millions of dollars each year for the state, which owns the land; the city, which is entitled to taxes on the project, and the developers, who own and operate the buildings. The Governor has already committed the state's share of revenue from the project to underwriting a bond issue for low-income housing. **********But as big as Battery Park City is, Mr. Frucher has no intention of stopping. After three years on the job, he has almost finished the project initiated and designed by his predecessors. Now he wants to leave his own mark on the Manhattan skyline. **********''I've spent a lot of nights imagining where we might go from here,'' said the 40-year-old public administrator-turned-developer, as he surveyed the view of Upper New York Harbor from his 18th-floor office in the new Dow Jones building. ''And I think I have an answer.'' Plan to Increase Project's Size **********The answer involves making Battery Park a destination for millions of visitors, as well as a residential community for 30,000 people and an office park for 31,000 workers. To do that, he has conjured up a package of ideas that would increase the size of the project by 75 percent. Those ideas include the following: *********** He wants to push the boundary north to Canal Street from its current limit just above Chambers Street, a 13-block extension that would add 68 acres to the project. To avoid the environmental conflicts that sank Westway, the now-defunct waterfront highway project that would have been built on and under landfill, Mr. Frucher would spend much of the next five years conducting ''thorough environmental impact studies.'' If necessary to overcome objections on environmental grounds, he would build part of the project on a concrete platform over the water, ''but that would make it expensive.'' *********** He has developed a proposal with the New York Zoological Society to build a $115 million ''biosphere'' on the waterfront at Vesey Street, a project he describes as a perpetual money machine. The attraction would bring 2 million visitors a year, he said, and that much traffic would increase sales for the merchants who will rent the 300,000 square feet of retail space in the complex. *********** He expects the Board of Education to build a new home on the northern end of the existing project, at Chambers Street, for Stuyvesant High School, one of New York's four magnet schools for high achievers; at the southern end, work has already started on a Holocaust museum, to be located on a site at the intersection of two streets not yet built, 1st Place and Battery Place. *********** Because the whole complex is so separated from the rest of the financial district by West Street (office workers often talk about ''going into Manhattan'' for lunch), Mr. Frucher dreams of building a trolley across Liberty Street to Maiden Lane to tie his project to the South Street Seaport on the East River. ''The city is doing a feasibility study,'' he said. The trolley would help create a loop of tourist attractions that might start with the Statue of Liberty, lead to a new Museum of the American Indian housed in the United States Custom House, then to Federal Hall, the New York Stock Exchange and other sites. *********** He wants to grant to Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the Canadian company that developed and now manages the four office towers already located in the complex, the right to build a fifth tower that might cost $600 million. The new skyscraper, of 2.4 million square feet, nearly the size of the RCA Building, would be located on the northwest corner of Vesey and West Streets, across from the American Express headquarters. Little Backing for Proposals **********None of these proposals has yet stirred much opposition - or support, for that matter, given that few people have heard of them - but when word of the new office tower gets out, it is sure to unleash a flood of criticism from private developers. **********The financial district already suffers from the worst glut of office space in a decade, but that does not disturb Mr. Frucher. **********''Glut is good public policy,'' said the man who spent most of his career as a political campaign organizer and then as the chief of various city and state agencies. ''It drives down rents and stimulates growth.'' **********Private developers seeking to attract tenants for their own projects in the neighborhood worry that a new building would drain the market of prospects. **********Richard A. Kahan, managing partner of Continental Development Group, is one of the severest critics of the proposal so far. Mr. Kahan was a predecessor of Mr. Frucher as chief of Battery Park City before becoming a private developer in 1983. His company, along with five partners, has won the right from the city to develop an office tower above the Whitehall Ferry Terminal. **********''From the very beginning, the state envisioned that Battery Park City would contain 6 million square feet of office space,'' Mr. Kahan said. ''To add another 2 million feet violates the intent of the legislature in creating the authority 18 years ago and makes the state a competitor with private business.'' Opportunity to Make Money **********Mr. Frucher sees the fifth tower as an opportunity to make more money for the state to use in the construction of low-income housing, and, he said, it would not compete with private developers because its lower rents would appeal to a different kind of tenant. Because Battery Park City is a state project, it enjoys an exemption from local property taxes. Even though the state makes a payment to the city in lieu of taxes, the project still enjoys a substantial advantage over private developments. **********Mr. Frucher speaks as if the project were already under way, but he has several hurdles to negotiate before he can sign a contract with Olympia & York to start construction. Because of an earlier agreement between American Express and Olympia & York, American Express has the right to stall any construction on the site, across the street from its own building. **********Then there could be pressure from the city to stick to the original master plan and from private developers to stay out of the market, despite Mr. Frucher's suggestions that the new building would not compete with them. Prospect of Litigation **********Finally, there could be lawsuits, as there were with Westway. **********Even the prospect of litigation has not dampened Mr. Frucher's enthusiasm. **********''This complex is already generating an unbelievable amount of money for the public treasury,'' Mr. Fruscher said earlier this month, ''and if we create a direct link between commercial development and financing for low-income housing, as we expect to do, it will generate much more. Why stop now?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/24/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 21, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PEOPLE", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; PEOPLE", "body_text": " *********** Gordon L.

Mercer, chairman of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, pointed recently to the company's stock price flashing on the computer terminal in his plush office here. **********''I used to check the stock price maybe once a week,'' Mr. Mercer said. ''But I've started checking it every day, sometimes several times a day, after this Goldsmith thing got started.'' **********Indeed, a lot has changed for Goodyear since the start of the ''Goldsmith thing,'' the bruising battle to fend off Sir James Goldsmith, the British-French investor. To end his takeover efforts, Goodyear last month announced a costly stock buyback that left Sir James with a profit of $93 million. But that strategy also means the world's largest tire maker will be refashioning itself from a diversified company with interests in aerospace and energy into a corporation with little activity outside its core rubber business. **********Strong Feelings **********The change has been painful for the 62-year-old Mr. Mercer, who has been with the company for nearly 40 years and who championed diversification. But the strong feelings extend far beyond the executive level. **********The fear of a takeover by Sir James was so pronounced among employees and union groups that Goodyear workers throughout the country gathered at high school football games and shopping malls to get signatures on protest petitions. **********The employees were well aware that the Crown Zellerbach Corporation was effectively dismantled after Sir James won a takeover battle for the forest products company. A campaign by Goodyear employees is widely given credit for fueling support in Ohio's Legislature for measures restricting takeovers. The prospect of such restrictive legislation helped dissuade him from pursuing Goodyear, Sir James said. **********As with other companies that have used a huge stock buyback to fight off raiders - CBS Inc. and the Unocal Corporation, for example - Goodyear's defense has been costly. **********The company now faces drastic cutbacks. The domestic work force of 70,000 will be reduced by about 5 percent within six months, with nearly 600 employees being laid off at the headquarters here. The $300 million research and development budget will be trimmed by more than $30 million, and millions of dollars in advertising will be canceled. Capital spending will drop to about $1 billion in 1987, from nearly $1.6 billion this year. **********''There have been some scars,'' said Fred T. Steel, plant manager of the radial tire factory in Union City, Tenn. ''We feel we have been raped, but there has been a tremendous unifying effect. There is a feeling of relief that this is over.'' **********But an attempt by someone else to take over the wounded Goodyear is still possible, analysts say. That is what keeps Mr. Mercer's eye on the company's stock, which was at $48 a share when Sir James offered to buy the company and at $43 when the stock buyback was announced.  [ It closed Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange at $43.125, up 25 cents. ]  This anxious atmosphere lends urgency to the biggest task now facing Mr. Mercer: to rethink the long-term strategy of a company whose future has long been tied to diversification. **********Buying back Sir James's stake and 40 million shares from other stockholders will cost $2.6 billion. To pay for that, Mr. Mercer put on the block Goodyear's Celeron subsidiary and its aerospace and motor wheel manufacturing businesses. **********That means Goodyear is once again basically a tire company, an industry that many analysts think has limited growth prospects. **********''Under the present circumstances, growth for Goodyear is going to be difficult to come by,'' said W. Dudley Heer, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. ''If you cut back millions on research and development, cut back in capital spending, increase your debt and sell a future stream of earnings and cash flow, you've got a difficult situation to face.'' **********For his part, Mr. Mercer insists that the future is far from bleak for a tire company. He notes that there is still plenty of market share to capture, particularly overseas. Furthermore, concentration on high-performance tires - an area with wide profit margins - could raise earnings, he said. **********Earnings per share will also be helped by the reduction in the number of common shares outstanding, he added. The stock buyback, including Sir James's stake of 12.5 million shares, involves nearly half of the total of 109 million. 'Knocked Us Backward' **********Mr. Mercer acknowledged, however, that the recent developments mean Goodyear's overall growth in the next five years will be at a slower rate and more difficult to achieve than it otherwise might have been. While contending that management is now ''moving ahead on all fronts,'' he conceded that ''this Goldsmith thing has knocked us backward in many ways.'' **********For Mr. Mercer, one of the most difficult aspects of the situation is the proposed sale of Celeron, a Louisiana-based oil and gas exploration company. Mr. Mercer, who joined Goodyear in 1947 as a sales trainee and has spent all of his professional life there, was criticized intensely by Wall Street analysts for investing $820 million in stock to acquire Celeron in 1983, the year he became chairman and chief executive. The critics said that issuing stock to make the purchase diluted earnings, and many also questioned the wisdom of entering an industry in which the tire maker had little experience. **********But recently many analysts have changed their views. Celeron is scheduled to complete in 1988 a 1,750-mile crude oil pipeline linking offshore California wells to Texas refineries, and analysts had become optimistic about the contribution that could make to Goodyear. **********Mr. Mercer had also won points lately for his long-term strategy of trying to make sales of tires and related products account for half the company's total sales, rather than 80 percent now. Trying to Increase Market Share **********''So now we're faced with the question,'' Mr. Mercer said, ''of how do you grow in tires when that market appears to already be mature? You increase the size of the market share.'' **********Analysts see that as a difficult task. They point to the company's strong 21 percent share of the worldwide tire market and then they point to growing competition from foreign producers, particularly Japanese companies. They say that Goodyear will have to work hard just to maintain current levels, let alone penetrate new markets. **********Analysts also note that even though Goodyear's share of the tires for the domestic new-car market rose from 30.5 percent in 1984 to 32 percent last year, it is unlikely that it will rise notably this year because there have been no agreements reached to provide more tires to auto makers. **********Analysts agreed that Mr. Mercer would do well to concentrate on high-performance tires, but they note that the company already has 90 percent of that market in this country. That leaves expansion in overseas markets, where the competition with Japanese rivals is particularly heated. (Goodyear recently announced, however, that it would be dropping one of its high-performance lines, for Grand Prix Formula One racing.) Upgrading Plants and Equipment Still, analysts say there are some pluses for the tire company. For example, Goodyear has spent $3.4 billion in the last decade to upgrade its plants and equipment. Its manufacturing plants in Tyler, Tex., and in Lawton, Okla., are considered the most modern and efficient in the industry. That leads analysts to conclude that the company is well poised to compete on price in an industry where price slashing is commonplace. **********''The company is in a good position to pick up small increments in market share,'' said Harry W. Millis, an analyst with McDonald & Company. ''As a pure tire company, they're faced with an industry with a couple of percentage points of annual growth. Goodyear can outpace that, but not dramatically.'' **********While some analysts suggest that the company would do well to make modest-size acquisitions in high-growth areas, such as chemicals, Mr. Mercer insists that any diversification activity is unlikely in the near term. ''We've got two things that we have to do now: get the debt down and the stock price up,'' he said. Seeking to Retire Debt **********Of course, Mr. Mercer's agenda will be furthered if he can retire much of the debt by selling Celeron and the other units. He has said that the sales should bring more than $2 billion, a figure analysts say is realistic. So far, there have been no concrete offers, Mr. Mercer said, although there has been ''a good deal of interest from a variety of parties.'' **********Meanwhile, still bitter over the ''Goldsmith thing,'' Mr. Mercer said he would actively lobby for Federal legislation that would require a corporate raider to operate a company that it took over. **********During his battle for Goodyear, Sir James offered some of his views on how Goodyear should be operated, saying that shareholder value would best be served by shedding non-tire operations and concentrating on its core business. **********In testimony at a Congressional hearing, he said that such divestitures would mean ''transferring activities from the hands of management with inappropriate experience into those with appropriate experience.'' He added, ''Normally this results in greater growth and prosperity for the companies concerned, thereby benefiting employees, shareholders, customers and communities.'' **********Mr. Mercer sees no such benefits. ''Goldsmith does all of this under the banner of enhancing shareholder value,'' he said. ''Sure, the company is still intact. But has this added to the gross national product? Have we added to the company's ability to create jobs? I don't think so. This guy almost closed down the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, and that's totally unthinkable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/03/world/in-australia-bicentennial-with-a-yawn.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1986-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 791, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN AUSTRALIA, BICENTENNIAL WITH A YAWN", "print_headline": "IN AUSTRALIA, BICENTENNIAL WITH A YAWN", "body_text": " **********Australia is getting ready for a yearlong birthday party in 1988, the 200th anniversary of the first migration from Europe.

The theme here is ''Living Together.'' **********But there is a tricky task ahead: getting Australians to work up some enthusiasm for the festival. **********Self-promotion is not a local trait, a visitor is told. On the contrary. Try to float a balloon of patriotic hoopla past an Aussie and he will come at it with a very large pin, Australians say.

''Australians are not nationalists.'' It may be too soon to determine if this national birthday party will spark an interest in the roots of the country's increasingly varied ethnic makeup, a goal of the Australian Bicentennial Commission. **********But the owner of a Sydney bookstore called Australia's Heritage reports a modest surge in requests for works of genealogy. And a group of independent researchers has set up an Australian Biographical and Genealogical Record, hoping to produce pocket biographies of every person of European descent living in Australia before the end of 1841. **********For generations, the description ''Australian'' usually meant someone of British or Irish descent, according to Bob Gregory, a professorial fellow in economics at the Australian National University in Canberra. **********Acres of British-style bungalows in Sydney's outer suburbs attest to that heritage, although a newspaper thought it worth noting wryly recently that someone had spotted a tea strainer being sold locally with instructions. 'A Massive Change Here' **********''When I was in school, everybody was like me,'' said Mr. Gregory, who is in his mid-40's. ''People of my vintage say, 'What do you want a bicentennial for?' **********''My kids are more conscious of the fact that Australians now come from all over, and they talk about being Australian in a way I never thought of,'' he said. **********He says he wonders if Australia, like the United States, will have to create a national ethos to unify a diverse nation. ''I think there has been a massive change here,'' he said. **********Australia had almost no population of Asian or Pacific descent in the early years of this century, except for aborigines and the descendants of 19th-century Chinese laborers. The country did not open its doors wide until World War II, when European refugees began arriving from the Baltic states and elsewhere. Migrants from Mediterranean nations soon followed. **********Since the 1970's, Australia has also accepted large numbers of Vietnamese boat people and refugees from the continuing war in Cambodia. **********A question for social scientists now is whether these most recent newcomers will take on traditional Australian characteristics, resist them, or change the national character. A Study of National Roots **********In the 1950's, the scholar Russel Ward went looking for the roots of the national character and produced a book called ''The Australian Legend,'' now a classic that has been through several editions. **********He found that the tough characters of the Australian bush - the sheepmen, ranchers and drifters in a bleak and punishing terrain - had greatly influenced his countrymen's image of themselves, more and in different ways than the lone cowboy of the American West had left his mark on Americans. **********The Australian, more ''matey'' and less individualistic than the American, thinks of himself as a practical man, Mr. Ward wrote, ''rough and ready in manner, and quick to decry any appearance of affectation in others.'' **********''He is a hard case,'' he wrote, ''skeptical about the value of religion and of intellectual and cultural pursuits generally. He believes that Jack is not only as good as his master but, at least in principle, probably a good deal better, and so he is a great knocker of eminent people.'' **********He does not like snobs much, either.

Verification procedures are left to be defined in the future. **********Verification promises to be one of the most difficult aspects to negotiate in a final accord acceptable to the five Central American nations. Pessimism and Optimism **********''This could go on for a year or two years,'' said the Guatemalan Foreign Minister, Francisco Quinones. **********Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann of Nicaragua disagreed. He said he was optimistic that a final treaty could be negotiated and signed by the end of July. **********''We have been able to see to it that Contadora is very much alive,'' he said. **********Contadora negotiators had set Friday as the deadline for Central American governments to complete discussions on provisions to be included in a new treaty. It is now up to the Central American nations affected by the new treaty - Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala - to analyze it and indicate whether they are willing to accept the latest provisions. A Declaration by Officials **********In what appeared to be an effort to define the conditions needed for a final accord, the Contadora negotiators, represented by officials from Mexico, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela -which are the original Contadora nations, thus called after the Panamanian island where they first met to start their peace effort - as well as officials from Peru, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, made a declaration to accompany the draft treaty. **********They condemned efforts to aid guerrilla groups in the region at a time when the Reagan Administration is seeking new aid for anti-Sandinista guerrillas based in Honduras. **********But in what was interpreted as pressure on Nicaragua's Sandinista rulers, they also called for pluralistic democratic systems in the region, chosen by free and periodic elections. **********The five Central American nations have been far apart in recent talks over two key articles of the regional accord. The articles would limit acquisition of weapons and foreign military maneuvers, as well as defining verification methods. Compromising on Force Limits **********Two weeks ago Nicaragua made a proposal that called for an end to foreign military maneuvers and also agreed to limit some weapons, but refused to limit the size of its army. Guatemala and Costa Rica have put forward a proposal that would limit both weapons and the size of armies on a staggered scale. Neither proposal has met with unaminous accord among the Central American neighbors. **********According to a copy of the new draft treaty made available to a reporter today, the latest version of the accord offers a mix of the two proposals. **********It calls for an immediate suspension of acquisitions of arms and increases in the size of armies. It also calls for a complete inventory of all weapons and soldiers in the region. The Central American nations are then given 30 days to agree to specific ways to limit their weapons and armies. If they fail to do so, the prohibition on acquiring new weapons will be lifted. **********The treaty says weapons and troops should be weighted according to a complicated system taking into account the security needs of each individual country. While the complex formula is certain to require considerable further negotiation, it does seem to offer a basis for discussion. **********At one point it seemed that Nicaragua would not sign a draft treaty, but in the last week it has appeared that Nicaragua may be more disposed to an agreement and that Nicaragua's neighbors may be the ones backing away from signing. The policy of the Reagan Administration is likely to play a large part in whether an accord is signed. The Administration has appeared divided over whether to encourage a treaty or to try to scuttle its chances by pressing some Central American nations to increase their demands for an accord to the point where either they or the Nicaraguan Government would refuse to sign a treaty. **********United States officials say they are particularly concerned because a regional treaty would disallow United States aid to the anti-Sandinista guerrillas, commonly known as contras.

Witnesses, including clerics who saw the fighting, said the police seemed to have supported a group of about 3,000 avowedly conservative blacks, known as the vigilantes, against an estimated 8,000 radicals, who are known as the comrades. **********The official police tally of deaths stood at five, but medical workers said 14 blacks had died, some of bullet wounds, others hacked to death with scythe-like blades called pangas. More than 1,600 people have died in the nation's bloodshed since September 1984. **********Many Are Made Refugees Again **********Many of those made homeless today became refugees for the second time in a month. In May, more than 30 people died and 30,000 were made homeless by fighting in Crossroads, where well over 100,000 blacks have congregated since 1975 in defiance of laws forbidding their access to white-run cities. **********The earlier fighting was ascribed by antiapartheid campaigners such as the Rev. Allan Boesak, the president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, to official subterfuge designed to chase many of the squatters away. **********Witnesses said the vigilantes - who owe their loyalty to a squatter leader viewed as favorable to official intentions - gathered Sunday night and today and were confronted by large numbers of so-called comrades. **********Groups of vigilantes moved forward, witnesses said, with police vehicles at their flanks. **********The police rigorously denied favoring either faction and said they fired tear gas in a vain attempt to head off a clash. But the Rev. John Freeth, a white Anglican priest who witnessed the fighting with other clerics, told reporters: ''The police were not doing a single thing to prevent it.'' **********As in last month's fighting, the comrades seemed to have lost the battle. Many Combatants Had Guns **********Witnesses said many of the combatants, on both sides, had guns. Some of the comrades were said to have fired Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles, a favored weapon of the outlawed African National Congress. **********As the radicals fell back, witnesses said, the vigilantes advanced on an area of Crossroads known as K.T.C., a shantytown about a mile away from the main squatter camp. K.T.C., named for a trading store in the area, was home to thousands of squatters. **********According to witnesses, the vigilantes - called ''witdoeke'' in Afrikaans for the strips of white cloth they wear as identification - set fire to may homes in the K.T.C. area, sending thousands of people fleeing. **********After last month's upheavals, many of those made homeless sought refuge in the K.T.C. area and were made homeless again today. A refugee center, set up after the May violence, was also reported razed and two big tents sheltering refugees were burned today, witnesses said. **********Relief workers from the Red Cross and other services withdrew from the area after the fighting, witnesses said. A Policy of Excluding Blacks **********For years, the authorities have sought to control the influx of blacks into Cape Town, which is reckoned to be the only city in South Africa where blacks, as defined in South Africa's racial lexicon, are in an absolute minority, since for many years the authorities sought to exclude them in favor of people of mixed race. **********Crossroads, peopled by those fleeing the unemployment and poverty of the so-called tribal homelands, thus became an emblem of defiance. **********The Government of President P. W. Botha wants to rebuild Crossroads as a settled township for about 30,000 blacks, and to move the rest to a new place, 10 miles away, called Khayelitsha. **********Crossroads residents have largely refused to leave their homes, so the fighting has achieved in a few weeks what the authorities had been trying to do for years. In both last month's fighting and today's battles, thousands of squatters have been made homeless, and the site of last month's violence has been flattened by bulldozers in readiness for the area's redevelopment. Cleric Protests and Is Arrested **********''There was not a single piece of evidence in the one and a half hours of our presence of police action to prevent the burning,'' said Mr. Freeth, the Anglican priest. **********The cleric said he had sought to intercede with the police and had talked with senior police officers. ''I said it was an observable fact that nothing was done to prevent the Witdoeke burning, looting and setting fire to houses and so on,'' he said. ''And at that point, they arrested me.'' **********The priest was later freed and talked to reporters. A television team for Worldwide Television News was also detained during the upheaval, television colleagues said. **********Seen from close by, the fighting left scores of homes and other buildings ablaze. Policemen sealed off the area. **********At evening, a convoy of at least 15 armored trucks bearing white soldiers in combat gear pulled out of the area.

Their candidates accused the Socialist Government of having weakened the police by an undue emphasis on liberalizing the judicial system. **********The general feeling among officials of the new Government is that the effort to devise new approaches to security and terrorism is crucial to its ability to portray itself as more effective than its Socialist predecessor. 'Completely Different' Doctrine **********''Our doctrine on terrorism will be completely different,'' Jacques Godfrain, a member of Parliament who drew up a conservative program on security, said in an interview. **********Mr. Godfrain contended that the Socialists' approach was guided by the belief that ''if there are terrorists it is because people are suffering and you have to satisfy some of their demands to eliminate the terrorism.'' **********''Our approach will be to suppress the terrorists without talking to them,'' Mr. Godfrain said. He said France's secret services would be expected to play a greater role than in the past. **********The Government's emerging anti-terrorist program comes against the background of the worst spate of terrorism against France and its citizens abroad in many years. **********Of the seven French hostages being held by extremist Moslem groups in Lebanon, two of them have been captive for more than a year. **********Another Frenchman, Michel Brian, a 42-year-old teacher, was kidnapped Wednesday. Today, two claims of responsibility for the kidnapping were made in Lebanon, one by the previously unknown Siffine Islamic Organization and the other by ''the kidnapping group.'' Support for Iraq Cited **********The assumption here is that the actions, carried out by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon, have two goals. The first is to force France to stop supporting Iraq, which buys most of its arms in this country, in the war with Iran. The second is to secure the release of terrorists imprisoned in this country. **********Among these are the five members of a commando group that unsuccessfully tried to assassinate the former Iranian Prime Minister, Shahpur Bakhtiar, in Paris in 1980, killing a French policeman and a bystander. Also imprisoned here is Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, the presumed leader of the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction, which claimed responsibility for the killing of an Israeli diplomat and an American military attache, Charles Ray, in Paris in 1982. **********Up to now, the French approach has been to maintain indirect contact with the terrorists, generally through Arab intermediaries, and to show a willingness to make some concessions, particularly in the case of the hostages in Lebanon. **********In January, for instance, the Government held indirect talks, through intermediaries in Damascus, with the pro-Iranian groups holding four French citizens in Beirut. According to French press reports, largely confirmed by officials and foreign diplomats, the French refused the main terrorist demand, which was to exchange the hostages for at least four of those jailed for the attack on Mr. Bakhtiar. Deal Fell Through **********But newspapers here reported that President Francois Mitterrand, trying to steer a middle course among senior officials who were sharply divided, agreed to release the head of the commando group, Anis Naccache, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment. **********The arrangement fell through, according to a Foreign Ministry official, when ''the terrorists raised the ante,'' presumably by stepping up their demands at the last minute. **********Officials close to the conservative Government say privately that the approach of the Socialists failed in at least two respects. First, it focused public attention on the hostage crisis and on the demands of the kidnappers. Second, after the failed effort to secure the hostages' release, the situation has clearly worsened. **********''The effort now will be to calm things down,'' a Foreign Ministry official said. ''It will be to remove the ability of those who are holding the hostages to focus public attention on the issue, while we return to secret diplomacy.'' **********In the last few days, the new Government has embarked on a diplomatic effort to improve relations with Iran, sending two senior Foreign Ministry officials to Teheran for talks aimed, in the words of a Foreign Ministry statement, at ''examining together the possibility of bringing about a solution to the problems present in our relations.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/08/business/finance-new-issues-jersey-county-sets-67.9-million-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jersey County Sets $67.9 Million Issue", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Jersey County Sets $67.9 Million Issue", "body_text": " **********Monmouth County, N.J., is offering $67.9 million of general improvement and reclamation center bonds through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. **********Yields on the tax-exempt issue range from 4.50 percent for bonds with a final maturity in 1987 to 6.20 percent in 1991, 7 percent in 1996 and 7.30 percent in 1999. **********The bonds, rated double-A by Moody's and Standard & Poor's, are backed by the full faith and credit of the county.

Humm, vice president of the credit management group at Merrill Lynch, which has been promoting home-equity loans. ''The idea is to reduce or possibly eliminate the use of consumer debt and use other forms of credit that are still deductible.'' A New Form of Financing **********In recent weeks financial institutions have been hawking second mortgages and home-equity loans as the vogue in consumer financing. Even colleges that make direct loans to students are advised by tax consultants to get into the mortgage business so the loans will remain deductible. **********Meanwhile, brokerage house margin accounts are gaining new appeal as one of the last bastions of interest deductions. Interest on borrowings to finance investments (including margin accounts) will remain deductible up to the amount of investment income earned during the year. **********As a general rule, consumer debt will become more expensive under the new tax law. Deductions for credit card finance charges, car loans, student loans, Internal Revenue Service interest charges and other consumer loans will be phased out over a four-year period. In 1987 only 65 percent of such interest will be deductible, 40 percent in 1988, then 20 percent in 1989 and 10 percent in 1990. Doubling the Actual Cost **********This means the real cost of consumer loans eventually will as much as double. Until now, for a top bracket taxpayer, credit card finance charges of 18 percent have effectively been reduced to 9 percent by the interest deduction. But under the new law the out-of-pocket cost of an 18 percent credit charge will be the full 18 percent after such deductions are completely phased out. **********Most American households -particularly non-itemizers who were never able to claim interest deductions anyway - are not likely to care. They might even benefit from the repeal of the deduction if, as some economists predict, interest rates fall as a result of the new tax law. **********But for the estimated 28 percent of households that have used interest deductions, the story is different. Some may simply end up borrowing less than they did before. But others may turn to alternative financing sources where rates are lower or deductions continue. Using Mortgage Interest **********Since mortgage interest will remain deductible, homeowners can borrow against their homes to finance consumer purchases and still deduct the interest. Bankers and brokers have been promoting second mortgages and home-equity loans as salvation for homeowners seeking a deductible way to finance college educations, cars and other items. **********''It's like a bakery line at most of the financial instituions out here,'' said Richard A. Sprayregen, a financial services partner at the accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal & Company in Los Angeles. ''With the prospect of losing the interest deduction on their Mercedes or Jaguar, they're trying to rechannel their borrowing to their home.'' **********Second mortgages and home-equity loans have become popular in recent years, and the new tax law is expected to give them an extra push. **********Home-equity loans are technically second mortgages, but there are substantial differences. How a Home Loan Works **********With a second mortgage, the borrower gets a lump-sum check for the full amount of the loan upon signing the papers. But a home-equity loan is essentially a revolving line of credit, where money is drawn as needed by writing a check or, in some cases, by using a credit card. Terms for second mortgages range from 5 to 15 years; home-equity loans can run longer. **********Tax and investment advisers say home loans can be an economical way of borrowing for various needs, but they urge caution. **********First, they recommend shopping around because terms vary widely from institution to institution. Today home loan rates range from 7.5 percent to 10.5 percent, according to HSH Associates, a mortgage monitoring firm in Riverdale, N.J. Most lenders also charge ''points'' - up-front fees of 2 to 3 percent of the loan amount. The loans also commonly entail closing costs of $200 to $400, according to HSH. In a few areas, such as Georgia, rate wars have developed and some lenders now waive closing costs. Warning on Rate Changes **********Another reason to be cautious is that many lenders offer no protection against a spurt in interest rates. In contrast to first mortgages, variable-rate second mortgages and home-equity loans often have no limit on how far the rate can rise, said Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH. **********If interest rates shoot up, therefore, monthly payments could rise to unaffordable levels. Falling behind on home-loan payments can jeopardize more than a person's credit rating: A house can be lost just as easily as with a first mortgage. **********Mr. Havemann recommends that the borrower ask the lender for a document disclosing the terms in detail, including what index is used to adjust the loan rate. **********In addition, he suggests that homeowners calculate whether refinancing a first mortgage, which usually carries lower rates, would be less costly than taking out a second mortgage or a home-equity loan. ''You really have to go through the numbers carefully,'' he said. How Much Banks Will Lend **********As a rule of thumb, banks will lend up to 75 or 80 percent of a home's fair market value. Under the new law, however, mortgage interest deductions on first and second homes are limited to the original purchase price of the home plus the cost of improvements. Deductions for loans in excess of that amount are disallowed unless the extra borrowings are for educational or medical expenses. **********Thus, if a house originally cost $70,000 and a $30,000 swimming pool were added to the house, mortgage interest on as much as $100,000 in home loans would be deductible - no matter what the purpose. If the homeowner had a total of $125,000 in home loans outstanding, the extra $25,000 would be deductible only if it were for medical or educational expenses. **********To protect Americans who borrowed heavily against the appreciated value of their homes in recent years, Congress exempted mortgage debt incurred before last Aug. 17 from the new rules. But amounts borrowed on or after Aug. 17 are bound by the new limits. This will make it difficult for many people to tap the equity in their homes. New Reason to Sell Home **********For example, someone who purchased a house 20 years ago for $30,000, which is now worth $200,000, would be stuck with the $30,000 limit on deductible mortgage loans - unless improvements had been made to the house or the borrowings were for medical or educational expenses. **********Lawrence B. Gibbs, the new Internal Revenue Commissioner, speculated recently that these restrictions might encourage some homeowners to sell their houses and buy new ones to get around the new limits. For instance, a homeowner facing the $30,000 limit could sell the home for $200,000 and buy a new one for $200,000. By making the swap, the taxpayer could claim deductions on an extra $170,000 of mortgage loans. **********One issue awaiting clarification from the Internal Revenue Service is what educational borrowings qualify for the higher deductible limits. The new tax law stipulates that the expenses must be ''paid or incurred within a reasonable period of time before or after such indebtedness is incurred.'' One question is how the I.R.S. will define ''reasonable.'' Unresolved Expense Issue **********''It's clear that you could take out a home-equity loan and write a check for the current year's education expenses,'' said Kaye B. Ferriter, a tax partner in the Boston office of Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm. ''But whether or not you could take out a loan in year one that is large enough to cover four years of school is questionable.'' **********Albert Ellentuck, a tax partner at the accounting firm of Laventhol & Horwath, said he would probably advise people to wait, if they can, until I.R.S. regulations resolve the issue. **********Although home loans are expected to become a major source of educational financing, they may not always be best for other purposes. People buying a car may find that subsidized financing offered by automobile manufacturers is cheaper - even though that interest is not deductible. **********NEXT: How new rules affect real estate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/26/world/around-the-world-south-korean-leader-shuffles-his-cabinet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Korean Leader Shuffles His Cabinet", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; South Korean Leader Shuffles His Cabinet", "body_text": " **********President Chun Doo Hwan shuffled his Cabinet today, replacing 10 of the 22 ministers, a presidential spokesman said. **********Foreign Minister Lee Won Kyung was replaced by Choi Kwang Soo, chief of South Korea's mission at the United Nations, and Chung Suk Mo was replaced as Interior Minister by Kim Chong Hoh, a member of Parliament from the governing Democratic Justice Party. **********Prime Minister Lho Shin Yong and the Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Planning Minister, Kim Mahn Je, were among those retained. **********The main opposition group, the New Korea Democratic Party, had demanded the resignation of the whole Cabinet for what it called misrule and a lack of democracy in the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/17/world/moslem-factions-begin-attacking-gemayel-s-forces.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1986-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 651, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MOSLEM FACTIONS BEGIN ATTACKING GEMAYEL'S FORCES", "print_headline": "MOSLEM FACTIONS BEGIN ATTACKING GEMAYEL'S FORCES", "body_text": " **********Forces backing President Amin Gemayel, the winner in a battle against a Christian opposition militia Wednesday in which 200 people were reported killed, came under attack by Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist forces today. **********The development raised new fears here that Lebanon was headed toward a resumption of full-scale civil war. **********Eleven Moslem militias and factions began advancing against Mr. Gemayel's Christian militiamen a day after the President's forces crushed the Lebanese Forces, headed by Elie Hobeika. **********The police said that 600 people had been wounded in addition to the 200 slain in the decisive 12-hour battle Wednesday. **********Gemayel Opposed Peace Accord **********Mr. Hobeika, 29 years old, a former banker, was forced to resign as president of the executive committee of the Lebanese Forces.

'Some Shareholder Shock' **********''There is going to be some shareholder shock at the dramatic over-reporting of earnings earier in the year and the adjustment in the fourth quarter,'' he said. ''This could well affect the market, because it's going to make companies look like they are falling off a cliff in the fourth quarter, and we may see some sell decisions in January that should not be made.'' **********Congressional tax experts estimate that the loss for all companies that have made use of the investment tax credit in 1986 could amount to about $10 billion in the fourth quarter. This estimate, as well as the one made by Kidder, Peabody, allow for transition rules under which companies may claim the tax credit for certain investments made this year. **********''Theoretically, accounting for the loss of the investment tax credit should not cause difficulties for companies, because everybody knows it's happening,'' said Susan C. Lakatos, an associate economist at Kidder. ''The problem is that when fourth-quarter profit reports start rolling out on the news wires, there will be no way of knowing immediately how much a company's earnings have been affected by the adjustment for the repeal of the I.T.C. and how much by real changes in their financial condition.'' A 6 to 10% Write-Off **********The investment tax credit has enabled companies to write off 6 to 10 percent of the cost of their investments in machinery and equipment. The new tax law repealed the credit, retroactive to Jan 1, 1986, but transition rules generally will permit companies to claim it for projects underway or for binding contracts entered into by Jan 1. **********Elimination of the credit was one of the few elements that seemed certain to be included in the tax overhaul package even before Congress gave its final approval of the legislation in September. But accounting standards require companies to continue to reflect the credit in their quarterly profit statements until the tax legislation is actually signed into law. President Reagan is expected to do that within a matter of days, but an offical date has yet to be announced. **********Under a proposed technical bulletin issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on Sept. 19, companies that have claimed the tax credit in 1986 would be required to make a one-time adjustment to their earnings reports in the fourth quarter to reflect the loss of the credit for the entire year. **********The F.A.S.B. has given the public until Oct. 20 to make comments on the proposal and expects to issue a final bulletin by the first week in November, according to Neal McGrath, the F.A.S.B.'s project manager for this issue. **********To complicate matters, companies reporting third-quarter profits after the President has signed the tax legislation, but before the F.A.S.B. ruling is final, may choose to make their accounting adjustments in the third quarter rather than the fourth quarter. Mr. McGrath said that once a final F.A.S.B. ruling was issued, those companies would have to go back and restate third-quarter profits to claim the tax credit, and then adjust along with everybody else in the fourth quarter. 'Very Ambiguous' **********''The next few days are going to be very ambiguous,'' Ms. Lakatos said. ''We won't know if the third-quarter profits simply reflect the I.T.C. adjustment, or if they are really off and are going to get even worse in the fourth quarter when the I.T.C. adjustment is actually made. It's that kind of ambiguity that makes investors nervous.'' **********Arthur Siegel, the national director of accounting services for Price Waterhouse, said companies would probably include somewhere in their earnings reports an explanation that tax expenses had increased because of the loss of the tax credit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/18/business/aloha-retains-bear.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aloha Retains Bear", "print_headline": "Aloha Retains Bear", "body_text": " **********Aloha Inc. said its board had retained Bear, Stearns & Company to advise the company with respect to enhancing shareholder values.

And for most of that time, workers have considered it a generous employer, offering good wages and job security. But they are not saying that now.  In a move to slash its costs, the giant lumber company is insisting that its 8,000 unionized employees accept cuts of 20 percent or more in wages and benefits. **********The workers are resisting the cutbacks. And with the existing contract expiring May 31, the battle promises to be a showdown of major proportions, one that will greatly affect the future of the giant timber company, the unions and the entire Northwest forest products industry. **********Many Wall Street analysts say such a move is overdue at a company they have criticized for low profits and for failing to adjust to changing industry conditions. **********'This Is the Test Case' **********''This is the test case; the company cannot give in,'' said George B. Adler, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York. **********''They're progressively getting further and further out of line,'' agreed John E. Maack Jr., an analyst with S. G. Warburg, Rowe & Pitman, Akroyd, in San Francisco. ''After 10 to 15 years, even Weyerhaeuser finally catches on.'' **********Weyerhaeuser, based in Tacoma, says the cuts are necessary if the company is to remain competitive with many nonunion mills that have sprung up in the Northwest. The company is offering a profit-sharing plan that would allow some wage cuts to be restored if its situation improves. **********''We have both an intent and desire to get into a framework where we can compete in the longer pull, over good times and bad,'' George H. Weyerhaeuser, president and chief executive, said in an interview. In 1985, the company reported net income of $200.1 million, or $1.32 a share, down 11.5 percent from 1984. Revenues dropped to $5.2 billion in 1985 from $5.5 billion in the previous year. **********But Weyerhaeuser's attempts to get tough on cost control might be ill timed. The forest products industry, after several years of a slump, is starting to recover, spurred by low interest rates that have fueled new home construction. The weakening of the dollar is also helping America forest product companies, particularly Weyerhaeuser, which is the most heavily export-oriented among them. Mood of the Workers **********With business improving, workers are in no mood to take a pay cut, and they are threatening to strike unless the company withdraws its demands. ''They can't push a pay cut down our throats when we're making money,'' said James Montgomery, who echoes the sentiment of other workers at the mill here. **********Weyerhaeuser, in turn, is threatening to close some mills if the new contract is not signed. **********For the unions, the current negotiations could be a last stand. As in other industries, such as airlines, union representation in the forest products industry has shrunk dramatically in recent years, with the closing of unionized mills and the opening of nonunion ones in the South and Northwest, and many unionized workers have already had to make concessions to keep their jobs. **********With so much at stake, both sides have mounted major lobbying efforts. For several months, top Weyerhaeuser executives, including Mr. Weyerhaeuser, have been going to towns with company operations and trying to convince not only workers, but also the general public, that the cuts are needed - with only limited success. Jeers and catcalls greeted Charles W. Bingham, the executive vice president in charge of the wood products group, when he spoke in the high school auditorium here. Strong Lobbying Efforts **********The unions, for their part, have also been lobbying hard, taking such action as mailing a report critical of the Weyerhaeuser family to securities analysts, the press and others. **********The two unions representing employees, the International Woodworkers of America and the Lumber Production and Industrial Workers, are negotiating separately with many other companies, acccounting for 35,000 employees in all, but the Weyerhaeuser pact is expected to set the pace for the industry. **********That is partly because Weyerhaeuser is the largest factor in the Northwest's timber industry, as it has been since 1900, when a group led by Frederick Weyerhaeuser, a German immigrant, bought huge tracts of forest land in Washington and Oregon. The company now owns six million acres of timberland, an area eight times the size of Rhode Island, of which half is in Washington and Oregon. **********While the lumber business in general has been hurt by foreign competition, oversupply and the 1982 recession, the Pacific Northwest has been hit hardest by the loss of business to the South, which has lower wages, and to Canadian concerns, which American companies charge with receiving unfair subsidies from their government. Closing of Mills **********Some 100 of 500 mills in the Northwest have been closed, and overall employment in the forest products industry in Washington and Oregon has shrunk from a peak of 159,300 in 1978 to 127,000 in 1985. **********Moreover, many mills have closed and opened under new management, as nonunion operations. Weyerhaeuser says these operations pay combined wages and benefits that average at least $5 an hour less than the $20 Weyerhaeuser says it pays. **********So far, however, Weyerhaeuser has stayed in the region and with the union. Weyerhaeuser officials and analysts say part of the reason for this is that Weyerhaeuser has prided itself on its paternalism toward employees and on its commitment to the Northwest. But others note that the company is wedded to the area because of its huge land ownership here. **********Another factor, however, is that the company did not notice fast enough the changes in the industry. Three years ago, during the last round of contract talks, the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation broke away from the other major companies and pushed for union concessions. It endured a long, violent strike and is still subject of a union-sponsored boycott, but most of its plants are now nonunion. **********''You have to give them credit for seeing a set of economic conditions we didn't see,'' Mr. Weyerhaeuser said. Benefits of Land **********Analysts say that because Weyerhaeuser purchased its land at the beginning of the century at extremely low prices, it has had a cushion to insulate it somewhat from competitive problems. As a result of this cushion, they say, the company let its plants become somewhat inefficient and it did not diversify aggressively enough into paper, distribution and other building products, as did Georgia-Pacific, which passed Weyerhaeuser to become the largest company in the business about a decade ago. Weyerhaeuser remains the biggest in wood alone, however. **********Weyerhaueser's concentration in the Northwest, on exports and on timber all led to the company being hurt very badly in recent years. **********''We have been positioned very, very differently in both product mix and geography than any of our competitors, and we have suffered to a much larger degree than any of our competitors,'' Mr. Weyerhaeuser said in an interview at the company's headquarters building, which has enough potted plants on the inside to fill a small forest and enough vines on the outside to blend in with the scenery. **********Mr. Weyerhaeuser, the great-grandson of the company's founder and the chief executive for about 20 years, chafed at suggestions from analysts that the company's has not been aggressively adjusting to changed circumstances, although he agreed that profits have been ''somewhere between grossly inadequate and somewhat less than tolerable.'' **********Weyerhaeuser has cut its payroll from 42,800 in 1981 to 35,000 at the end of 1985. It has instituted several salary freezes. In its Northwest wood products operations, the company has cut half its salaried employees. Despite labor contracts, the company has closed some plants, reopening then only after getting worker concessions. **********Weyerhaeuser has also started to diversify into real estate and financial services. It is the largest supplier of private-label disposal diapers, and it has become a major player in the garden supply business. **********The company has also expanded to the South and into Canada. Indeed, union officials point out that while the company attributes much of its problems to Canadian competition and small nonunion mills in the Northwest, it owns six mills in British Columbia and buys wood from some of the small nonunion mills. The union also complains that while the company is asking workers for a cutback, it has not asked the same of stockholders. Dividends have not been reduced even though the company's earnings last year covered the payout with only 2 cents a share to spare.

The lower revenue created a problem for the negotiators because their efforts to make up the shortfall could force them to undo delicate agreements reached earlier. **********The reason for the revenue shortfall is that the budget office's new forecast, which projects lower economic growth and inflation, reduces the revenue gains expected from curtailing some tax benefits. 'It's a Blow to Us' **********Mr. Packwood and Mr. Rostenkowski met for several hours tonight and broke up without resolving a way to come up with the extra money. The two legislators said they would meet again Friday, but they seemed less optimistic than they had previously been about reaching an agreement before the end of the week, when Congress begins a three-week recess. **********''It's a blow to us to have been so close and yet so far,'' Mr. Rostenkowski said. ''I'm not saying that it's over, but it's disappointing at this time to get a shortfall.'' **********After seeing the new revenue estimates, Mr. Packwood said, ''Danny and I looked at each other, and he said, 'I wish we could blame each other.' '' **********On Tuesday, the full 22-member conference committee broke up in disagreement, and the two chairmen were instructed to meet privately to try to arrive at an accord. Final Vote in September **********Even if they are able to reach an agreement and get approval from their conferees this week, the final vote will almost certainly not come until after Labor Day. **********''Regardless of what we achieve this week, I can't believe there won't be a chance to vary it on some details if in brooding over it we find it unacceptable,'' said Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island. **********The two chairmen met until after midnight this morning but did not meet again until suppertime tonight. Mr. Rostenkowski was busy managing legislation on the House floor to raise the Federal debt limit, and Mr. Packwood spent the day giving what one staff member called ''bitter pills'' to the other Senate conferees. **********Mr. Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, has solid control of a majority of the House conferees. His staff says he has been mindful of the particular needs of his conferees in negotiating with Mr. Packwood, but lawmakers agree that in the end, the representatives will approve whatever their chairman decides on. **********However, Mr. Packwood's majority among the Senate conferees is flimsy. The word in the Senate cloakroom today, according to one senator, was that Mr. Packwood, an Oregon Republican, was delicately balancing trade-offs to keep a majority behind him. **********Mr. Packwood identified three issues this afternoon that were still open, he said, when he and Mr. Rostenkowski went home early today. They involved the volume and type of tax-exempt bonds that would be allowed, the tax treatment of oil and gas producers and the rules, applying mostly to military contractors, for paying taxes on profits from long-term contracts. **********Mr. Packwood and Mr. Rostenkowski have not discussed their decisions publicly. But there was a consensus among many other lawmakers, staffers and lobbyists that the chairmen's agreement would include top tax rates slightly higher than the 27 percent for individuals and 33 percent for corporations approved by the Senate in June. Corporate Tax Increase **********The chairmen were apparently working toward a corporate tax increase of about $125 billion over the next five years and a reduction of taxes on individuals by the same amount. **********Several lawmakers and staff members said Mr. Rostenkowski and Mr. Packwood had tentatively agreed to disallow deductions for state and local sales tax payments in most instances, to adjust the standard deduction and personal exemptions for inflation beginning in 1989, to scrap a Senate plan to allocate a larger share of the Internal Revenue Service's budget to enforcement functions, to restrict the generous depreciation schedules in the Senate bill only slightly and to compromise on the tax treatment of business inventories. **********Those are some of the issues on which the two sides were far apart when the bargaining began."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/12/business/company-news-ge-will-close-tv-tube-plant.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.E.

''The market was hoping for something between $30 and $32,'' he said. **********Flexibility With Offer **********Two provisions in the terms of the purchase agreement, which was approved by Big Three's directors, give L'Air Liquide flexibility with its offer. First, it must receive 67 percent of Big Three's shares before it will buy any of the stock. In addition, its American subsidiary, American Air Liquide, received an option to acquire about 18.5 percent of Big Three's stock for a discounted price of $24.125 a share. Big Three has 36.3 million shares outstanding. **********The option, available ''under certain conditions,'' possibly would give L'Air Liquide the guarantee of a substantial profit if Big Three draws a higher offer. Big Three's president, Thomas E. Sands, declined to comment on the option. **********The rapid decline of the Texas oil industry has contributed to steady losses at Big Three's oilfield service and welding-equipment distribution units for several months, but its healthy industrial gas business has kept the company profitable. It has comparatively low long-term debt, at 26 percent of total capital and has a reputation for keeping a tight rein on costs. Employment was pared to 3,848 in July from a peak of 6,329 in 1981. Earnings Drop in Quarter **********Big Three, with headquarters in Houston, had an earnings drop of 15.3 percent, to $10.5 million, or 29 cents a share, in the second quarter ended June 30, compared with a profit of $12.4 million, or 32 cents a share, a year ago. Sales fell 22 percent, to $164.9 million from $210.6 million. Its book value was $13.83 a share at the end of the quarter. **********Robert Bartels, an analyst with William Blair & Company in Chicago, said antitrust laws make it unlikely that a competing bid from either of the two largest industrial gas producers in the United States, the Linde division of the Union Carbide Corporation, and Air Products and Chemicals Inc., will emerge. Big Three ranks No. 5 among domestic producers. **********Mr. Bartels said investors had anticipated for a few years that Big Three might be sold. Its chairman and chief executive, Harry K. Smith, 74 years old, and his brother, Albert K. Smith, 75, co-chairman, control 8 percent of the company's stock. The L'Air Liquide bid would be worth about $85 million to the Smiths. **********Harry K. Smith, son of one of the three men who co-founded the company in 1921, introduced the concept of using pipelines as the prime means of industrial gas distribution in the early 1950's. The move created greater efficiency in the distribution of industrial gas because the gas could then be produced at fewer but larger plants at greater distances from the costumers, Mr. Bartels said. **********By connecting pipelines to refineries and petrochemical plants across the Gulf Coast during the last 30 years, Mr. Smith built a dominant share in what then was his industry's fast-growing region.

When they first made their appearance a decade ago, they did so as essentially high-status, expensive paperweights, gadgets that enthusiasts endeavored, often in vain, to figure out what to do with. In a few years, a smattering of applications software became available for the machines, but they still sold in far greater numbers than their usefulness at the time would seem to dictate. They sold on the promise of wonders to come, a promise that in some areas, such as business, but not in others, like the home, was to be eventually fulfilled. **********In the shadows of this curious market stood Michael Shane, purveyor of wigs, faded blue jeans and then - acting with an uncanny sense of what would be hot and what would not - Elephant's Memory floppy disks, Banana printers and Leading Edge computers, which are arguably the best-selling low-priced I.B.M. PC clones around. **********Now, in classic ''sell razors to sell razor blades'' pursuit, he is marketing modems, those avaricious scavengers of data, along with an as yet unfinished information sytem that he hopes will include information on everything from how to cook bluefish to the price of eggs in Peru. Beneath this marketing scheme lies the vision of an international trading company that would match products with markets, eliminating economic dislocation, hunger and poverty. **********Listening to Mr. Shane's messianic theme, one is for a moment almost swept away by the fancy that perhaps, given access to enough information, the world might solve its problems. But left with one's reflections on such a scheme, one soon returns to reality. The visionary dwindles to a Don Quixote with a computer for a lance. **********Still, there are all those razors Mr. Shane is virtually giving away in the hope that blade sales will ultimately reach incalculable proportions. At $149, as compared with $495 for the Hayes equivalent, the Leading Edge Model L 1200 B internal modem (from Leading Edge, Camton, Mass., 02021, (800) USA-LEAD) may not be free, but it's a real bargain. **********The modem is a full-feature one, complete with speaker, on a half-size add-on card that fits easily into any slot on the I.B.M. PC, PX-XT, PC-AT or PC Portable as well as, needless to say, the Leading Edge computers. One particularly attractive feature of the L 1200 B is that the switches controlling such functions as which communications port is to be used and the status of the carrier-detect signal (used by the modem to inform the computer that it has made contact with another) are all accessible from the back of the computer, even after the card has been installed. **********So is the volume control for the speaker. There is no need to remove the computer's cover every time an adjustment has to be made. This is a particularly handy feature for advanced users who deal with a number of different communications packages, all of them invariably needing the switches set differently. Two telephone jacks are provided, one for the wall jack, the other for the handset itself, a convenience allowing a single line to be used for either voice or data. **********The modem comes complete with its own communications program, Bitcom, from Bit Software Inc. This is a basic telecommunications package that, while lacking some of the superspecialized features aficionados like to talk about, provides all the essentials the average user needs, including a facility for setting up and storing a series of commands that are used to log on to different data bases, say, or to control such functions as calling a certain number at a certain time, redialing at set intervals, if necessary, until a connection is made. **********BOTH the modem and the software are relatively easy to install. However, even though Bitcom is one of the less complicated of the communications packages on the market, telecommunications software will have to be made even simpler before a first-time user can hope to conquer it with ease. **********The 32-page hardware manual and the 64-page software manual are bound together into a volume that manages to remain far slimmer than those accompanying most communications peripherals. On the whole, the manuals do an adequate job of supplying the details necessary to operate the modem, though at the expense of background and explanatory material on telecommunications. The bare-bones approach, evidence of a product orientation geared toward the more accomplished personal computer operator, becomes perhaps a little too Spartan at times. For instance, when installing the card, one is told to ''make sure the computer is turned off.'' This precautionary instruction is really inadequate, particularly where a monitor has its own separate power cord to the wall socket. The only truly safe course is to unplug all the equipment to be worked on, together with any peripherals connected to it in any way. **********Once the modem board has been slipped into a slot in the computer, it is ready for a series of self-tests. These are also simplicity itself. The first of them requires only typing in the letters ''ATZ'' (they must be upper case), followed by the notation ''ATS16-1 C1 D,'' then any other character. The same character appearing on screen in response indicates that the modem is working. **********A couple more equally simple procedures complete one's preparations. One never really learns what ''1 C1 D'' and the like refer to. But as long as the modem is working properly, the ignorance imposed on the user causes no difficulties. If the modem isn't performing as it should, well, then with any luck the two-year warranty will take care of the problem. **********As soon as the self-tests are done, one can run the software, selecting for an introduction to the world of telecommunications any of the bulletin boards or other preconfigured telephone listings on the Communications Selection menu. The trial run provides a feel for how the menu-driven Bitcom program works without the necessity of mastering all of its more detailed features, such as terminal emulation. **********Together, the Leading Edge modem and Bitcom form a bread-and-butter communications package that is probably about as simple to use as personal computer technology will allow at the moment. One does need some familiarity with computers for success in using it. But if it is not yet the modem for everyone that Michael Shane seems to have envisioned, he has certainly done it again where price is concerned. For a corporate buyer able to take advantage of quantity discounts and fortunate enough to have a staff member knowledgeable about computers, it's almost irresistible."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/business/prospects.html": {"writer_name": "Pamela Hollie", "pub_date": "1986-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 705, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROSPECTS", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS", "body_text": " **********Tricks of Trade Will a strong yen and weak dollar eventually reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States? Yes and no. ''There are signs that the monthly trade deficits are easing,'' said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. Even though Mr. Resler expects this year's trade deficit with Japan to be $60 billion - up from $46 billion last year - he says, the deficit may drop to $45 billion next year. **********But these figures will not tell the whole story. Japan may hold on to the surplus through indirect exports not reflected in Japan-United States trade tallies. **********The yen's strength means that Japanese companies can manufacture goods more cheaply in Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies follow the dollar, says Ryo Nishiura of Nissho Iwai American, a Japanese trading subsidiary. The low costs and dollar-pegged currencies mean that the goods can be exported from Taiwan and Korea to the United States at competitive prices. The weaker dollar also encourages the Japanese to manufacture more made-in-the-U.S.A. products, which American consumers can buy without paying the differential arising from a strong yen. ''We want to keep our customers,'' said Mr. Nishiura. Dollar Detente? As the United States debates with its trading partners over how far the dollar should drop, the currency could get a lift - from an unlikely source. ''It's possible that a reversal may be assisted by the Soviets,'' said Andre W. Alkiewicz, managing partner at Perception International in Ridgefield, Conn. **********The Soviet Union, says Mr. Alkiewicz, may soon spur dollar-buying by issuing its first dollar-denominated Eurobonds. With the loss of food exports after the Chernobyl disaster and with lower-priced oil, ''the Soviets badly need foreign currency,'' he said. **********The Kremlin is already borrowing heavily - about $1.2 billion from Western banks in the first six months of this year, compared with $1.5 billion for all of 1985. But foreign bankers estimate the Russians' total foreign-currency needs to be at least $3 billion. And such big sums can be raised more easily in the Eurobond market. ''Borrowing from banks costs more than floating a bond issue,'' Mr. Alkiewicz said. Scientists from Overseas **********With fewer Americans studying science and engineering these days, about half of the nation's new Ph.D.'s in these fields are foreigners. According to William Stewart of the National Science Foundation, foreign scientists also hold about 20 percent of staff jobs at Federal and private research and development labs. The problem, says **********Patrick McGuire of the Conference Board, is that the foreigners could decide to go home at any time, taking American technology with them. ''Looking down the road, we are in the unusual position of training our competitors,'' he said. Government institutions are worried about the growing number of foreigners in high technology, too. Says John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists: ''The Defense Department is concerned that there won't be a large enough pool of American scientists to do classified research.'' Philippine Finance **********The Senate rejected a proposal to increase aid to the Philippines last week, but now may be the time for the private sector to invest in the country, says Peter Wallace, Manila-based representative of Business International, a New York consultant. **********In August, the Philippine Government, following the lead of Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Argentina, began to offer American companies debt-for-equity swaps to reduce the Philippine debt held by American banks and corporations. The deal works like this: A company buys Philippine debt - discounted to about 65 percent of face value - in the secondary market. Then the central bank in Manila retires that dollar-denominated debt by paying the new debt-holder the full face value, in pesos. The pesos must be spent to start or expand operations in the Philippines. **********Of course, the success of such investments depends on the country's economy, says Mr. Wallace. But he says that ''the economic decline appears to have bottomed out'' in the Philippines. After years of contracting, he says, the economy may soon turn around, spurred by the business community's optimism about President Corazon Aquino's administration. The country's gross domestic product, he says, may grow by as much as 4 percent next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/11/world/syria-tied-to-berlin-bombing-and-to-attempt-on-el-al-jet.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1986-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2235, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SYRIA TIED TO BERLIN BOMBING AND TO ATTEMPT ON EL AL JET", "print_headline": "SYRIA TIED TO BERLIN BOMBING AND TO ATTEMPT ON EL AL JET", "body_text": " **********British and West German investigators say they have information strongly suggesting that Syria plotted a terrorist bombing in West Berlin and an attempt to place a bomb aboard an Israeli airliner at Heathrow Airport in London. **********They plan to make the information public later this year when they bring two Jordanian-born brothers to trial in connection with the incidents. **********Reports from New York Times correspondents in Britain, West Germany, Israel, Jordan and the United States and disclosures by officials close to the investigations permit a partial reconstruction of the brothers' involvement with Syria. **********According to the officials, the Syrian secret services, working through Syrian diplomatic missions in London and East Berlin, appear to have engaged Nezar Nawaf Mansour Hindawi, 31 years old, to plant a bomb on an El Al jet on April 17 by hiding it in a satchel carried by his Irish fiancee. British Silent on Case **********British officials refuse to talk about the case publicly and there has been no discussion in Britain of military retaliation against Syria. Today, Britain announced the expulsion of three Syrian diplomats after Damascus refused to waive their diplomatic immunity and to allow the police to question them about terrorist activities. **********Mr. Hindawi is also thought to have arranged, through his brother, Ahmed Nawaf Mansour Hazi, 36, the bombing on March 29 of an Arab-German friendship society in the Kreuzberg neighborhood of West Berlin, using explosives and logistical support supplied by the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin. **********The police in West Berlin also strongly suspect that Mr. Hazi, who is in custody there, may be connected to the bombing on April 5 of a West Berlin discotheque in which an American serviceman and a Turkish woman were killed and about 230 people were burned and wounded. But the police say they have no hard evidence linking Mr. Hazi with that bombing and he has steadfastly denied involvement. U.S. Has Accused Libya **********American officials have accused the Libyan Government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of having masterminded the discotheque bombing, which they cited in justifying the air raids on Tripoli and Benghazi on April 15. They say their information was based on messages between Tripoli and the Libyan People's Bureau, or embassy, in East Berlin that were reportedly intercepted and decoded by West German intelligence officials, Volker Kahne, the spokesman for the West Berlin Justice Ministry, noted such a connection this week, saying that ''a track also leads to Libya.'' Moreover, West German security officials have said Mr. Hazi made at least one visit to Libya after moving to West Berlin in 1975. They also said sketches of what appeared to be restaurants and other buildings had been found in his apartment on his arrest, perhaps linking him to the discotheque bombing. The officials said there appeared to be no direct link between the Syrians and that bombing. **********Many details in the attempted airliner bombing and the attack on the Arab-German society remain unclear, including the political affiliations of the brothers. The precise motive Syria might have had for arranging the attacks, beyond the desire to strike at Israel or any Arab organization suspected of pursuing a moderate political course, is also unclear. **********Morever, Syria has denied that its embassies and diplomats had anything to do with the incidents. It has accused Israel and the United States of using the allegations to justify future military action against Syria. **********Most experts agree that the attacks seem to be a part of the intricate web of Middle Eastern rivalries and struggles, involving above all Libya and Syria, though few are willing to venture a full explanation. **********According to news agency reports, Syria has already begun to limit the movements in Damascus of the followers of Sabri al-Banna, the terrorist leader better known as Abu Nidal, whose signature some say is on the London and Berlin incidents. Followers of Abu Nidal are thought to have carried out the assassination in June 1982 of the Israeli Ambassador in London, which led among other things to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and some feel Syria fears similar action. **********On Wednesday, the Israeli Defense Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, said in Washington that Syrian officials were responsible for the attempt to bomb the El Al plane. But Prime Minister Shimon Peres, evidently sensitive to Syrian anxiety, affirmed in a radio interview later in the week that ''Israel has no intention of attacking Syria.'' Investigators Trace Suspect's Movements Much has been learned about the origins of the brothers held on suspicion of having taken part in the incidents. And a picture, although incomplete, has emerged of their unusual wanderings from villages in northern Jordan through several European countries, including Poland, East and West Germany and Britain. **********These are among the findings: *********** About six weeks before the attempted attack on the El Al plane, Mr. Hindawi went from Damascus to London by plane escorted by a Syrian intelligence officer, according to information Israeli officials gave Administration officials in Washington this week. The Israelis say they received the information from Britain and officials there have expressed concern that early disclosure of the findings could jeopardize the investigation. *********** The explosive device and logistical help in planting it were provided by people attached to the Syrian Embassy in London, according to the same sources. *********** Immediately after the foiled attack, the sources said, Mr. Hindawi fled to the Syrian Embassy and was briefly kept in two apartments ordinarily used by Syrian diplomats. *********** Mr. Hindawi later fled his Syrian keepers and went to the hotel room of an Arab friend, who got in touch with another Hindawi brother, Mahmoud Hindawi, an employee in the medical department of the Qatar Embassy in London. Both men evidently persuaded Nezar Hindawi to give himself up. On April 18, the day after the incident, he surrendered to the British police and later led them to the apartments where, he said, he had been kept by the Syrians. *********** Later that day the West Berlin police, on a tip from Scotland Yard, broke into an apartment in the Tempelhof neighborhood and arrested Mr. Hazi, whom they identified, despite the difference in name, as Mr. Hindawi's brother. Mr. Hazi's name and address were found in Mr. Hindawi's address book. The police said Mr. Hazi had been arrested in connection with the bombing of the discotheque, La Belle. He denied having anything to do with that attack, but acknowledged he had been trained in Syria and had been one of a group that laid the bomb at the Arab-German society, which wounded seven people. *********** Last Tuesday, the West Berlin police announced the arrest of two other Arabs in connection with that bombing. They were identified as Farouk Salameh, a 39-year-old Jordanian, and Fayez Saahanweh, a 34-year old Palestinian born in Jordan who had acquired West German citizenship by marrying a West German woman. Both men were said to have lived in West Berlin for some time. *********** Interrogated by a West Berlin magistrate, Mr. Hazi and Mr. Salameh confessed to having laid the bomb at the Arab-German society. In independent testimony that the police said was virtually identical, they said they had received the explosive device in an attache case from the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin. The newspaper Berliner Morgenpost, citing security officials, said the suspects reported they had been instructed in the use of the explosive by a Syrian diplomat accredited in East Berlin, Abu Ahmad. The authorities said the two suspects recounted that they hid the bomb in a locker in East Berlin for several days before taking it by car to a shop owned by Mr. Salameh in West Berlin. *********** Both men said Nezar Hindawi had directed every step of the bomb attack and had directed the Arabs in Berlin to pick up the bomb at the East Berlin embassy. Nezar Hindawi was said to have sent an unnamed Syrian from London to West Berlin to repair the detonation device on the bomb after it twice failed to explode. The bomb ultimately detonated, wounding seven people, two seriously. The Woman's Bag Conceals a Bomb It is not known when or where the plan was hatched to bomb the Berlin club or plant the explosives on the El Al aircraft. But British newspaper reports, which have been broadly confirmed by intelligence sources, have said Mr. Hindawi met his Irish friend, Anne-Marie Murphy, a chambermaid in a London hotel, in Dublin about a year ago. **********After breaking up about six months ago, Mr. Hindawi suddenly reappeared and begged forgiveness. According to the reports, Miss Murphy became pregnant, and Mr. Hindawi gave her $300 for a wedding dress, telling her to travel on an El Al flight to Munich and Tel Aviv, where he would meet her. **********Mr. Hindawi gave Miss Murphy a bag with a false bottom that concealed a bomb consisting of about 10 pounds of liquid plastic explosive, apparently made in the Soviet Union and supplied to Mr. Hindawi by the Syrians. **********Intelligence sources said the plastic explosive was attached to a computer-like device that would have shown up as a hand-held calculator on an airport X-ray machine. Inside the computer, the officials said, was a tiny amount of TNT arranged to ignite after takeoff, creating a ''sympathetic'' explosion that would have detonated the plastic. Authorities believe the device was timed to go off after the plane left Munich on its way to Israel. **********Authorities said El Al security officers suspected something amiss when Miss Murphy declared she was carrying only 55 pounds sterling on the trip to Tel Aviv. Despite her explanation that, as a Hilton employee, she would stay in a Hilton hotel in Israel free and that she would meet her fiance there, the officials became suspicious, searched her bags thoroughly and found the explosive. **********Miss Murphy insisted she knew nothing of the bomb and was later released. **********The question of family links continues to baffle investigators. **********Although little information was immediately available about Nezar Hindawi, the Jordanian editor of the London-based Al Arab newspaper, Mohammed Kabarday, said Mr. Hindawi had worked for the newspaper in London as a copyboy about four and a half years ago. But friends in Amman, the Jordanian capital, said he had been dismissed when he ''behaved badly'' after he was denied an editorial job. **********Sometime about 1983 he is said to have joined several Arab friends in putting out a magazine in London called Kol Jadid, which folded after a few issues. **********Mr. Kabarday said the Jordanian Hindawi clan comes from the Houran border area near the Syrian frontier and that several of its members have been politically prominent in Jordan. Thaughan Hindawi is minister of state in the Jordanian Prime Minister's office and several other family members have held senior government posts. In November 1972, a family member, Maj. Rafeh Hindawi, was arrested in an unsuccessful attempt to topple King Hussein and sentenced to life imprisonment. **********But it remains unclear whether the three brothers detained in London and West Berlin are really members of the clan. Indeed, Western intelligence sources in Germany said there appeared to be five brothers in the family, including two who are United States citizens. It is not known where these two brothers live. **********According to an Arab friend of the brothers in London, the brothers are in fact members of the Hazi family, whose name is used by Ahmed Hazi, and intelligence sources in Germany said some family members, apparently including the two brothers in London, may have adopted the resonant Hindawi name, gathering perhaps undeserved luster through association with the powerful clan. They said it was also possible the Hazis were distantly related to the Hindawi clan. The Roots Go Back To Jordan Village The Arab friend in London described the Hazis as modest Jordanian farmers from Baqura in the Jordan Valley. But according to acquaintances in Amman, Nezar Hindawi lived with his mother in the town of Zarka not far from Amman at least from about 1976. **********About that time he is also said to have started a career as a journalist, working part-time or as a freelance for several papers in Amman. He is then thought to have left Jordan to join his father, who was living in London, though acquaintances in Amman who visited Mr. Hindawi in London about 1980 said they found no trace of the father. **********Ahmed Hazi is said to have left Jordan about 1975 and passed through East Germany to West Berlin, as do numerous refugees from third world countries in search of asylum and jobs. Unemployed since his arrival, Mr. Hazi had been married to a German woman, but the couple were divorced. **********Former journalist colleagues of Nezar Hindawi in Amman described him as a braggart and self-promoter. Curiously, he is also described as being strikingly nonpolitical. One reporter friend said, ''He was not connected to any party or organization. It was not his style. He couldn't be bothered.'' **********But others who knew Mr. Hindawi at Al Arab in London said he had been a member of the pro-Syrian wing of the pan-Arab Baath party.

These days, independent nonprofit research institutes get about $1.2 billion annually from the Government, more than half their funding, for everything from weapons development to studies of illnesses among factory workers. **********It is no surprise, then, that institutes are bracing for the impact of Gramm-Rudman, the budget-balancing law that could mean significant cuts in Government spending. **********''We have noticed that Government agencies are already more reluctant to grant contracts because they are waiting to see the impact of Gramm-Rudman on their budgets,'' said Jim Compton, a spokesman for Southern Research Institute. **********Beyond engaging in a mind-boggling array of studies for various Government agencies, institutes actually operate a number of major Government research facilities.

Battelle got more than 80 percent of its $512 million in 1985 revenues from Government work. Government contracts are even more vital to the Research Triangle Institute, which was created by three North Carolina universities in 1958 to help attract technology-oriented businesses to the region. Federal money accounted for almost 90 percent of its $52.2 million in revenues in the year ended last Sept. 30. Southwest, the least dependent on Federal dollars of the large institutes, still gets about a third of its $140 million in revenues from Washington. **********Despite the threat of Gramm-Rudman, the institutes remain hopeful about the future. Southern, which relied on the Government for 60 percent of its $31 million in revenues last year and is most active in medical and environmental research, does not expect the flow of funds to drop sharply soon. Mr. Compton noted it recently won new contracts for AIDS research. **********Other institutes agree and are continuing to seek long-range projects.

Most of the allies rejected the imposition of sanctions when the United States asked for them earlier this year. **********Italy has been at the forefront of the controversy over Libya and is the European ally closest to Libyan territory. **********Italy's response to American calls for sanctions has been the most positive in Europe and includes a ban on weapons sales. **********But Italy's close economic ties to Libya have so far discouraged a stronger response.

And that, the company's executives now agree, was like standing amid quicksand. **********Within a few years, Europe's chemical fiber industry ran into jarring changes, as oil prices lifted the cost of raw materials skyward and cheap imports from developing countries pushed fiber prices lower. **********Today Akzo, with $7.2 billion of annual sales from more than 200 units in 50 countries, is one of Europe's most profitable chemical producers. The Dutch multinational company has reduced its reliance on the fickle market for textile fibers - partly by selling Enka America Inc. - and enhanced its expertise in industrial fibers such as polyester yarns used for mechanical rubber goods. **********Product Range Broadened **********At the same time, Akzo put millions of dollars into broadening its product range and spreading the geographical risk. Among chemicals the company now produces are salt used for de-icing, polyvinyl choride and chloroform for industrial use. It also makes decorative paints and car finishes, pharmaceuticals and hospital supplies and various consumer products. **********Some problems remain. For one, Akzo is locked in a legal battle with E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company over patent rights to an aramid fiber called Twaron, which competes with Du Pont's Kevlar. Twaron is used to reinforce ropes, plastic, concrete, aluminum and rubber goods such as tires and hoses. It also can help make apparel bullet-proof. **********Azko has asked the European Community to contest a ruling by America's International Trade Commission that bars sales of the Akzo product in the United States. The Race for Acquisitions **********Another problem is that Azko, which has a $600 million acquisition fund, has lost some of the plums in the market to richer competitors. Last year, BASF paid $1 billion for the Inmont Corporation, the coatings subsidiary of United Technologies, and Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries won the chemical division of the Beatrice Companies. **********But Akzo has drawn the attention of major American investors because it took on Du Pont and because of its record - including growth rates of more than 10 percent a year and a 20 percent return on equity. **********''We were forced to perform well because we had lost our shirt in fibers,'' Mr. Loudon, a 49-year-old former banker and now Akzo's president, commented recently. ''We profited from the fact that we streamlined our operations, and this increased our flexibility.'' Strong Recovery Is Cited **********Outsiders tend to agree. ''Akzo has recovered tremendously strongly, though earnings are expected to be somewhat flat this year,'' said Howard Coates, an analyst at the London brokerage firm of de Zoete & Bevan. **********Akzo's profit rose 12 percent in 1985 on a 10 percent sales increase. This year, its first-half earnings fell 2 percent from a year earlier, while its sales were down 12 percent. **********Chemical companies across Europe have suffered a sharp sales drop this year, with the lower dollar helping American companies, but analysts at Amsterdam's Amro Bank are keeping Akzo stock on the ''buy'' list. **********Other analysts say Akzo has shown an ability to rejuvenate itself. Long the world's second-largest fiber producer after Du Pont, Akzo stumbled when the industry was hit by high oil prices, the migration of Europe's textile industry to low-wage Asia and many countries' subsidies. Between 1976 and 1980 Akzo had some losses. Fiber Emphasis Is Altered **********Since 1981, however, Akzo has been reducing fiber capacity around the world, and focusing its energies on promising industrial fibers. It also is embarking on a campaign of acquisitions, particularly in the United States, where the company's sales already total $850 million a year. **********The idea is to make Akzo a significant participant in a number of growing chemical sectors, including paints and chemical coatings, new plastic materials and pharmaceuticals. **********''In 1973, fibers were 47 percent of Akzo sales,'' Mr. Loudon said. ''At the end of '85 it was 23 percent. Specialty chemicals were only 40 percent in 1973; today they are over 60 percent.'' **********Akzo is seeking new products and more acquisitions. In February the company acquired Wilson-Fiberfil International, a New Jersey manufacturer of engineered plastics with annual sales of $100 million. Some Recent Purchases **********That followed the acquisition last year of Litton Bionetics, a biotechnology research laboratory, from Litton Industries, and the diagnostics division of Warner Lambert, with combined sales of $190 million. **********This year, Akzo bought 50 percent of Spain's leading coatings company, Industrias Quimicas Procolor, after acquiring the British paint companies Blundell-Permoglaze and Blue Circle Sandtex. Last year Akzo bought Levis, a Belgian coatings company. **********Akzo has not deserted fibers, however. Texile Outlook International, a trade publication, estimated recently that man-made fiber production would increase about one-third by the end of the century. Although much of the growth is expected to shift to developing nations and the Eastern bloc, Akzo expects to profit from high-premium specialty fibers. New Products' Key Role **********New products such as Twaron are crucial, Mr. Loudon says, because tougher bidding has made acquisitions increasingly costly. ''Either they're not exactly what you want,'' he said, ''or the price is too high.'' **********A lot of Akzo's success will depend on the United States, he concedes. ''If we have a lower dollar and stagnating economies in Europe, that will have an enormously negative impact, since American competitors are showing up not only in Europe but also in third markets,'' he said. **********''The big question for 1987,'' Mr. Loudon said, ''is whether the United States turns to recession and Europe proves strong enough to continue. Personally, I have my doubts.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/14/business/business-and-the-law-court-to-hear-brokerage-suit.html": {"writer_name": "Tamar Lewin", "pub_date": "1986-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 793, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business and the Law; Court to Hear Brokerage Suit", "print_headline": "Business and the Law; Court to Hear Brokerage Suit", "body_text": " **********WHEN Eugene And Julia McMahon opened accounts with a brokerage firm several years ago, they signed the standard agreements providing that any dispute relating to the accounts would be settled by arbitration. **********But in 1984, when the McMahons decided that the broker handling their accounts had engaged in excessive trading to generate commissions and had chosen inappropriate securities for their needs, they went not to arbitration but to Federal court. The couple filed a lawsuit charging fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of the anti-racketeering statute. **********Shearson/American Express, as their brokerage firm was known at the time - it is now Shearson Lehman Brothers - argued that the claims should be resolved through arbitration. Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to decide the question - an issue of great concern to the securities industry because most major brokerage firms use an arbitration clause similar to Shearson's. **********Arbitration became a common method for resolving disputes between brokers and customers in the 19th century, but its use was cut back in 1953, when the Court ruled that claims brought under Section 12(2) of the 1933 securities law could not be decided by arbitration. **********But recently, Federal courts throughout the country have offered differing opinions on exactly which securities cases could be handled through arbitration - and the question is being litigated more and more. Nationwide, the Federal courts have on the docket more than 120 cases challenging the enforceability of arbitration clauses. **********The core question is whether the 1953 Supreme Court decision prevents arbitration of the most common securities cases, fraud claims brought under Section 10(b) of the 1934 securities law. Faced with overcrowded dockets, more and more judges recently have been supporting arbitration of such claims. **********''If the Supreme Court comes out for arbitration in Shearson v. McMahon, the effect is that almost everything will be arbitrated,'' said William J. Fitzpatrick, the general counsel of the Securities Industry Association. ''In effect it would undo the harm done by the Supreme Court's 1953 ruling. There's been a tremendous amount of confusion since then.'' **********The McMahon case demonstrates the legal confusion regarding the arbitration clauses. First, the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that the fraud part of the case should be arbitrated, but that the racketeering claim would have to go trial. Then the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that all the claims could go to trial. **********Most securities customers with claims against their brokers, like the McMahons, prefer not to go to arbitration. Legal issues aside, most lawyers who handle securities claims believe they are likely to win more money for their clients in a jury trial than they can in arbitration. **********''The ultimate recovery in arbitration is not as great as it would be if you prove your case in court,'' said Theodore Eppenstein, who is representing the McMahons. ''My clients are unsophisticated investors. We're looking for a trial by jury, which would be their peers. When you go to arbitration, you get tried by the brokerage firms' peers, and they find it hard to relate to unsophisticated investors, the kind who don't know a lot about stocks and rely on their brokers to do the right thing.'' **********Mr. Fitzpatrick, for his part, believes it is an advantage to have securities experts hearing claims. **********''You don't have to spend days explaining to a jury what stocks and bonds are,'' he said. ''Arbitration is a much more efficient way to resolve disputes and much less costly in legal fees. The customer gets a resolution within six months; in court it can take six years. A lot of lawyers like to delay things, and they don't like arbitration because it moves so quickly that they have to investigate their clients' cases right away.'' **********According to Mr. Fitzpatrick, 2,190 securities arbitrations were completed last year, most of them disputes between brokerages. But of the 961 cases involving customers, 530 resulted in an award to the customer. **********This year, there are likely to be substantially more arbitrations involving customers, because of a Supreme Court ruling last year that securities claims filed under state law must be arbitrated. Although that decision did not address the arbitration of claims under the Federal securities laws, Associate Justice Byron R. White, in a concurring opinion, suggested that Federal claims under Section 10(b) should also be arbitrated. **********''I think Justice White's opinion opened the way for a lot more arbitrations, since Federal judges are always looking for ways to cut down their caseload, and they can get rid of a lot of cases by sending them to arbitration,'' Mr. Eppenstein said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/business/l-japanese-methods-629886.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Methods", "print_headline": "Japanese Methods", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********One cannot help but be dismayed by daily reports of big American corporations announcing their plans to become more competitive. **********This usually means a reduction in the labor force, but seldom reductions in upper management.

These companies are going public in a period when stocks in many foreign countries have enjoyed bull markets of their own. **********The First Australia Fund made its debut in December. It was followed in February by the Italy Fund. Last week, underwriters offered shares of the France Fund. Also last week, the Germany Fund was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is expected to reach the market in July. **********And, in a variation of the single-country theme, the Scandinavia Fund is expected to go public early this week. This fund will concentrate its investments in the securities of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. **********These country funds are closed-end investment companies, meaning that they have a set capitalization. After the initial offering, the shares usually are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange. Closed-end shares can trade at a premium - or a discount - to the actual value of the underlying securities. **********By contrast, mutual funds, or open-end investment companies, have no fixed capitalization. Also, they allow investors to purchase or redeem shares continually at a net asset value pegged to the underlying portfolio. **********Long-term capital appreciation is the typical objective of country funds. Like all securities, these funds are subject to investment risk. Their market performance depends in part upon economic, political and other factors affecting individual nations. **********On this score the Mexico Fund, formed in mid-1981 when Mexico's oil reserves were hailed as a boon to its economy, provides an extreme example. Early on, the shares sold as high as $12.25. But subsequent devaluations of the peso and steadily mounting problems with Mexico's foreign debt sent the shares to as low as $2 this year. It closed Friday at $2.625, down 37.5 cents for the week. **********Country funds also face possible currency risks. The prospectus of the France Fund, for example, states: ''Because the fund's assets will be invested primarily in French securities and because substantially all income received will be in francs while fund distributions will be made in dollars, the fund's net assets and distributions would be adversely affected by reduction in the value of the franc relative to the dollar.'' **********Last year the dollar's weakness against foreign currencies contributed substantially to the success of mutual funds that invest in overseas securities. **********The popularity of country funds - purchased for the most part by individual investors - is indicated by the demand accorded the France Fund. Scheduled originally as an offering of 5 million shares at $10 apiece, the issue was expanded to 7.5 million shares at $12 each. In its first week of Big Board trading, the shares fell 62.5 cents, to $11.375. **********The Italy Fund's initial offering was 6.3 million shares at $12 each on Feb. 26, when its assets consisted essentially of cash generated by the sale. Soon thereafter, however, its shares sold at a substantial premium to net asset value, climbing as high as $17.875. Last week, the shares closed at $12.25, down 75 cents. **********''We are now invested about 65 percent in equities and 35 percent in Italian Government securities and Euro lire deposits,'' said Mario d'Urso, president of the fund. ''In addition to other stocks, equities include a cross section of major Italian companies, such as Fiat, Olivetti, Pirelli, Montedison, Banca Commerciale and Banco di Roma.'' **********Investors might wonder why country fund offerings take the form of closed-end investment companies, rather than mutual funds. One reason is that smaller foreign markets lack the liquidity of, say, the Big Board. This means that any sudden rush to redeem shares in a mutual fund could force the liquidation of positions at a huge disadvantage in a thinly traded market. But portfolios of closed-end funds are not subject to such redemption pressures, thanks to their fixed capitalization. **********The Japan Fund, first offered to investors in the 1960's, is a pioneer among single-country funds. Its shares now trade at a modest discount to net asset value, in contrast to the premium enjoyed in the early days of the fund. The Korea Fund, formed in 1984, has been a big success and its shares sell at a substantial premium to net asset value - a premium that recently ran as high as 48 percent, according to Norman Tepper of the Value Line Investment Survey. **********''Korea Fund sells at a large premium mainly because it is the only United States fund that the Korean Government will allow access to Korean securities,'' the analyst said. ''As long as access remains limited, we expect the fund to maintain its premium to net asset value. However, one risk in owning the shares at a premium is the possibility that Korea will become more open to foreign investment.'' **********In 1985, Korea Fund shares traded as low as $12.375. After selling as high as $36 earlier this year, the shares closed Friday at $30.50, down $1.75 for the week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/business/l-ideology-039886.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 214, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IDEOLOGY", "print_headline": "IDEOLOGY", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Professors Buchanan and Tullock ought not hide behind ideology unless they admit that much of economics is little more than a set of professed religious beliefs (''A Bias Toward Bad Government?''

In today's trading, petroleum rose above $14 a barrel on news that Norwegian oilfield workers had gone on strike. **********Mr. Bush said at today's news conference that although the Saudis had at least doubled oil production since last summer, the present level remains far below their daily output of 10 million to 11 million barrels of several years ago. **********''It seems difficult to me to blame one country whose production is historically down when others have raised their production, even though one country is the dominant producer in OPEC,'' Mr. Bush said. **********In his opening statement at the news conference, Mr. Bush said the weekend discussions had focused ''for the most part'' on security and economic issues and that he had ''reiterated the desire to see market forces at work.'' He added that he supported ''the lowest possible prices consistent with the fact that we need a strong domestic oil industry for our national security.'' **********Mr. Fuller acknowledged today that Mr. Bush had failed to make his position clear at a March 31 Washington news conference, where he said he would talk about price stability while in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer. **********In the United States the fallout from Mr. Bush's remarks raised questions within the Administration about his handling of sensitive policy issues and about whether Mr. Bush was intentionally deviating from Administration policy or had simply discussed oil prices in more detail than he should have. **********The Vice President comes from Texas, a major oil-producing state, and started his career as an offshore oil driller in Texas. **********At the Washington news conference, the Vice President added a warning that when oil prices fall rapidly to low levels, there is a possibility that some workers in the oil industry can be ''economically displaced'' and that national security considerations are raised by a potential lack of oil. **********Edward P. Djerejian, a White House foreign affairs spokesman, said today that Mr. Bush, in the talks with Saudi leaders, had not discussed setting oil prices and that such an objective had not been a part of the mission. **********Speaking for the Administration, Mr. Djerejian said: ''We continue to believe that the way to achieve real price stability is to let the free market work. We do think that real price stability will be obtained by allowing the free market forces to work.'' **********Although Mr. Djerejian said that there was no difference between the Vice President and Mr. Reagan on the issue, another senior Administration official said that Mr. Bush had made a mistake, The official, a Bush supporter who asked not to be identified, said the statements had provided ammunition to Mr. Bush's potential rivals for the Presidential nomination and had put Bush loyalists in an awkward position. **********Several close aides in Washington said they had been surprised by the attention the initial Bush remarks received. The wide publicity led to a decision within the White House that Mr. Reagan's spokesman, Larry Speakes, should attempt to reinforce the President's support for a free-market solution while also asserting that Mr. Bush's position was consistent with Mr. Reagan's position. **********But a senior White House official, who suggested that the President and the Vice President were at variance, said Mr. Bush's comments had not been very helpful to him in that they could have been construed as support for the oil industry or OPEC at the expense of consumers. **********''We believe in free-market forces as opposed to killing the consumer, and the chief free-market force is sitting down the hall,'' he said, alluding to President Reagan. **********Mr. Fuller said in the telephone interview that he believes that ''when some of the dust clears'' the public will understand that Mr. Bush was not advocating a new Administration policy. Moreoever, he said the public would understand, he believes, that the Vice President was attempting to address what could eventually be a serious problem for the nation if its oil supplies are affected."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/19/business/business-people-managing-editor-named-at-fortune.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1986-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 437, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MANAGING EDITOR NAMED AT FORTUNE", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; MANAGING EDITOR NAMED AT FORTUNE", "body_text": " **********In a series of changes among the senior editors at Time Inc., Marshall Loeb, editor of Time's magazine development group, was named managing editor of Fortune magazine, effective May 5. **********Mr. Loeb, who has been on leave as managing editor of Money magazine for the last two years, succeeds William S.

Cohan (who is buried there) on July 4 and, for the first time this year, a Christmas tree lighting celebration. ''These events are important from a marketing and competitive standpoint,'' explained Jeanne Capodilupo, Woodlawn's director of public relations. ''About a third of the people that attend are here for the first time, and many ask for more information'' about the cemetery. **********With the death rate stabilized, and increasing competition from a growing number of chains, companies in all segments of the funeral industry have been seeking creative ways of increasing market share. ''The old trend was to sit back and wait for the phone to ring,'' said Roy Pfeffer, stressing that more and more of his association's members are advertising their services and talking to community groups. **********Some are positioning themselves at least partly as non-profit community resource centers.

According to Jack Springer, there are now more than 830 crematories in the United States, up from about 580 in 1980.

Bonnie Harden, a pilot in Fort Collins, Colo., recently started Trail's End, a service which scatters ''cremains'' anywhere in the state for between $200 and $500. Most of the several dozen scatterings she has performed, she noted, have taken place over the deceased's homestead or favorite fishing and hiking grounds. Miss Harden eventually hopes to franchise the business throughout the country and sign up funeral directors as members so they can offer the service. **********''In talking to other pilots, I found out that many had done this for people on an individual basis,'' she explained.

This year the movie is ''Historia Oficial,'' or ''The Official Story,'' which is about events surrounding Argentina's so-called dirty war when more than 9,000 people disappeared in a military counterinsurgency campaign. The film was also nominated in the category of best original screenplay. **********''This time there is the feeling that we cannot lose,'' said an Argentine producer who travels frequently to Hollywood and brings back the latest studio gossip on the likely winners. **********The movie, which recounts how a woman adopts a baby girl and slowly comes to realize that the child had probably been kidnapped and orphaned by the military, was not particularly popular when released here early in 1985. According to the producers, one million fewer Argentines saw ''The Official Story'' in its first year than ''Camila,'' Argentina's 1985 Oscar nominee, which is based on a true story about a young Argentine woman and Jesuit priest who fell in love in the 19th century. **********Argentine distributors are betting that the Oscar nominations and the 16 awards ''The Official Story'' has received, including those of the New York critics and the film festivals at Cannes and Berlin, will make it a success when it is redistributed. **********In anticipation of the Oscars, magazines and local newspapers have published frequent features on the movie's producers, stars and writers. One television station is likely to televise the awards show live. **********Argentina is one of the few countries without a divorce law, but some legislators are hoping to change that soon. **********''There is a lot of consensus in the Radical bloc for a divorce law this year,'' said Ricardo Tevile, a member of the House of Deputies from the Radical Party of President Raul Alfonsin. **********Mr. Tevile, who has written a bill that would legalize divorce, added, ''We think its time to face reality.'' **********Different studies estimate that 7 percent of the country's married couples are on their second, ''unofficial,'' marriage. These people live together waiting for a divorce law to be approved. **********But Mr. Tevile acknowledged that the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes a divorce law, may hold a trump card. Pope John Paul II is scheduled to visit Argentina some time in 1987 and some feel it would be an affront to him to have his trip coincide with the legalization of divorce. **********To many here, the state of siege imposed on Oct. 25 and lifted 45 days later was an act of melodrama with little effect other than to send a message abroad that Argentina is as politically unstable now as it has been during the last 55 years and 24 governments. **********President Alfonsin imposed the state of siege with the intention of arresting six civilians and six military officers on suspicion that they were involved in a wave of bombing incidents. **********In the end, only eight of the suspects were arrested. The investigating judge never found the evidence to press formal charges and a new investigator has yet to move on any of the cases. When the state of siege was lifted, all of the jailed suspects were released. **********''Argentine society quickly forgets what dominated the political scene at any given moment,'' said Marcelo Cavarozzi, the director of the Center for Studies of the State and the Society. ''My impression is that the thing is dead, and there is not any public demand to revive it.'' **********Only recently, two of the three active military officers in the group were promoted. Maj. Jorge Granada became a lieutenant colonel and Capt. Leopoldo Cao a major. **********With Decree 2530, the Argentine Government has brought an end to the Graiver affair. The decree returns to David Graiver's family some 40 expropriated properties and $82 million, which will be paid in installments until 1989. **********Mr. Graiver, a financier with business in the United States as well as Argentina, was 35 years old when he disappeared in 1976 in a mysterious plane crash in Mexico. No identifiable remains were found and some people still have doubts about his death. **********The military Government had suspected Mr. Graiver of financing the Montoneros, an urban guerrilla group, and after his death it sentenced his wife, parents, brother, sister-in-law and two of his employees to 15 years in jail and expropriated their properties. The family, released five years later, sued to recover the properties, which included a construction company and farmland. **********In 1982 the family's name was cleared and Decree 2530 settles the restitution question. ''At least they have been acquitted and everything is over,'' said Horacio Oser-Roldan, one of the family's lawyers.

But analysts have called St. Louis a relatively weak hub, noting that other major airlines have more flights to more destinations from their hubs. **********Another activity that Mr. Ehrlich has begun to overhaul involves yield and capacity management - the art of determining how many seats should be sold at a discount and how many held for full-fare passengers. Such decisions have become critical to airline profitablity. **********Mr. Ehrlich drew on two colleagues from Eastern Airlines for this sector. Robert Cozzi was named T.W.A.'s vice president-revenue management, and Vincent Martinelli became director-domestic pricing. **********T.W.A. also named J. William Hoar as vice president of labor relations, who will direct all negotiations with the carrier's unions. He has been the airline's director-contracts for flight operations since October 1981. Departments Centralized **********By centralizing the departments concerned with capacity management, Mr. Ehrlich said, the airline ''will not spend days agonizing to make a decision.'' A quick response is needed to keep from giving competitors an advantage, he said. **********Many different departments, Mr. Ehrlich said, must work together quickly, using sophisticated computer programming, to determine how many seats should be made available for the lower fares. He estimated that it would be March before all the software and personnel changes could be put together into a new system. **********Richard Pearson, the president of T.W.A., who was asked to stay on by Mr. Icahn, recruited Mr. Ehrlich last fall, mainly to deal with the problem of managing airline capacity effectively in matching lower fares. **********The T.W.A. reorganization is also intended to improve productivity by using fewer people to do the tasks that must be done. This concept is dear to Mr. Icahn, who believes most companies are overloaded with management and white-collar personnel. **********Mr. Ehrlich said the staff in T.W.A.'s various departments totaled about 600 and was being consolidated to operate with 150 fewer people. **********A similar strategy, he said, will be used to increase the number of flights from the airline's St. Louis hub."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/12/business/futures-options-oil-prices-drop-again-heating-fuel-stocks-off.html": {"writer_name": "Lee Daniels", "pub_date": "1986-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 384, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oil Prices Drop Again; Heating Fuel Stocks Off", "print_headline": "FUTURES/OPTIONS; Oil Prices Drop Again; Heating Fuel Stocks Off", "body_text": " **********Prices of crude oil and petroleum products slumped again yesterday after several wide swings during light trading. **********Analysts said buyers appeared to withdraw to the sidelines in the afternoon to await the release after the market's close of a weekly industry report on crude oil and petroleum products. **********''Basically, it was a very quiet, dull day, and it was more than the normal lull before the A.P.I. report,'' said Peter C.

Unfortunately, this warning was not heeded in Washington. In effect, the Administration itself has made impossible at this stage the planned meeting on the level of foreign ministers.'' **********A report on the attack that was broadcast on the evening television news said no Russians in Libya had been harmed. **********The Soviet Union accused Washington of violating the United Nations Charter and called the attack ''a flagrant mockery of international law and human morality.'' **********President Reagan, in announcing the strike on Monday, said it was fully consistent with the United Nations Charter, which generally prohibits the use of military force except in cases of self-defense or in conformity with decisions of international bodies. **********The Soviet statement added, ''The latest actions of the United States convince even the few in the West who still had some illusions about the true intentions of the White House that its present policy is a policy of aggression that provokes regional conflicts, a policy of perpetuating confrontation and balancing on the brink of war.'' Little Choice for Soviet Seen **********Diplomats said Moscow had little choice but to take some diplomatic action against the United States. After American and Libyan forces clashed last month, the Soviet Union condemned American actions but did not make the incident a major issue. **********The diplomats said it was unclear at what point, if any, Moscow would feel compelled to intervene more directly. **********Although the Soviet Union has provided Libya with billions of dollars in arms over the last decade and has defended the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, when he was criticized by Washington, Moscow has considered the Libyan leader an unreliable partner, according to diplomats. The diplomats said it was unlikely Moscow would want to risk a major confrontation with Washington to protect an ally of questionable value. **********Still, they said, Soviet leaders would have to consider the alternative risk of appearing to give ground to an increasingly assertive United States. **********The Soviet Government press agency, Tass, quoted Mr. Gorbachev as having told Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden, who was in Moscow today: ''This action, which cannot be justified by any arguments, is a link in the chain of challenging and provocative actions of the United States taken in response to the Soviet Union's peace initiatives.'' ----U.S. Criticizes Soviet Decision WASHINGTON, April 15 - Mr. Speakes, the White House spokesman, said today that the Soviet Union's decision to cancel the foreign ministers' meeting cast doubt on its attitude toward international terrorism and its intentions on participating in a summit meeting this year. **********''We regret the Soviet decision and consider it a mistake,'' Mr. Speakes said. ''The Soviet decision shows where they stand on the important issue of international terrorism. It also says something about their commitment to work constructively on issues on the U.S.-Soviet agenda, including arms reductions and regional crises.'' **********At the State Department, Bernard Kalb, the spokesman, said: ''We regret this decision. We did the right, we did the necessary, thing in combating terrorism. We call on everyone, including the Soviet Union to join, to get aboard in what should be a global battle against terrorism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/world/around-the-world-200000-turn-out-for-aquino-in-philippines.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "200,000 Turn Out For Aquino in Philippines", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; 200,000 Turn Out For Aquino in Philippines", "body_text": " **********Corazon C.

Pierre Dubois, has been a prominent figure in the poor community of La Victoria, scene of frequent searches by Government forces. News Agency Bureau Closed **********Among the magazines closed was Hoy, probably the Chilean magazine best known internationally. It is generally identified politically with the right wing of the Christian Democratic Party, the largest political party in Chile. **********In ordering the closing of the six magazines, the Government also sent agents out early in the morning to confiscate from distributors copies of four that were about to go on sale. **********At the same time, Reuters, the British news agency, was ordered to close its Santiago bureau until further notice. The agency said the order, signed by the general in charge of enforcing the state of siege in the capital, gave no reason for the shutdown. It said the agency's lawyer was seeking an explanation from the Ministry of Defense. General's Motorcade Ambushed **********The state of siege, which includes new restrictions on civil liberties and expanded Government powers of arrest and detention, followed an ambush of General Pinochet's motorcade Sunday night as he returned to the Presidential Palace after a weekend in the Andes foothills 27 miles way. **********Five members of his police and military escort were slain and 11 were wounded in the attack, which a telephone caller said had been carried out by a group calling itself the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front. **********The ambush was believed to be the first attempt on the life of General Pinochet in the 13 years since he toppled the democratically elected Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens. President Allende died in the 1973 coup. **********In a late-night television appearance on Sunday, the President, his left hand bandaged from what he said was a shrapnel wound in the attack, warned Chileans that their country was ''in a war between democracy and chaos.'' **********''People don't realize the danger we are in,'' he said, apparently admonishing the large number of political groups and others who have been demanding that he schedule the end of his 13-year-old military Government. **********This morning, several hundred people gathered in the plaza outside the Moneda, the Presidential Palace, and cheered when the 70-year-old general arrived after visiting hospitals where the wounded were being treated. The President, who also commands the army, received expressions of support from the commanders of the other military branches, all of the army generals and his civilian Cabinet. **********Several members of the political opposition and officials of the Roman Catholic Church, a strong critic of General Pinochet, also sent messages or went to the palace to express their repudiation of violence as a means to change the government. Party Leaders Detained **********In the early morning, security agents in civilian clothes arrested several people at their homes, including Ricardo Lagos and German Correa, leaders of different factions of the Socialist Party, the party of the late President Allende. **********Also detained were Jose Carrasco, head of the journalists' federation, and the Rev. Rafael Marotto, who the Government says is a spokesman for the Leftist Revolutionary Movement. Father Marotto was suspended from priestly duties two years ago. **********President Pinochet and his 10-year-old grandson were being driven back to the capital when their motorcade came under attack from people armed with what the authorities said were automatic rifles, rocket launchers, bazookas and grenades. The President, who described the attack himself in an appearance on the state television network in the early morning hours today, said the ambush began when a station wagon pulling a small house trailer stopped in front of the motorcade and those inside opened fire. **********The first car in the presidential caravan was immediately hit by a rocket that turned it into a mass of flames. The next three cars, as well as the fifth, carrying General Pinochet, came under automatic weapons fire. The President's car, a Mercedes, quickly backed up, then raced off to Santiago with one escort car. Attackers Escape **********The other soldiers and policemen stayed behind and exchanged shots with the attackers, who apparently escaped in several cars. Authorities said they found the vehicles later along the south edge of Santiago with M-16 rifles and other arms inside. **********On Sunday the Catholic University television station sent a reporter to the scene of the attack and reported that military helicopters were flying over the area in search of the attackers. **********The station said that one car used by the attackers had been located and also said that M-16 rifles were inside. **********The Government attributed the attack only to ''terrorist commands.'' Although some news agencies, which normally receive calls from clandestine groups assuming responsibility for their actions, said the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front took responsibility, others said this was not so clear. **********Editors in the Santiago office of The Associated Press said a caller to their office Sunday night declared that the Patriotic Front was ''not dead, that it had failed this time but would not fail the next time,'' then hung up. **********About two hours later, they said, a man with the voice of the usual spokesman for the Patriotic Front called and said he did not have information ''for now'' about whether his organization had made the attack. He also denied, according to the A.P. editors, that the first call had come from his group. **********The Patriotic Front, named for a fighter who is said to have used guerrilla tactics in Chile's war of independence against Spain in the early 19th century, first appeared in 1983 and is generally considered to be the armed branch of the Chilean Communist Party.

''We will not be part of that agreement,'' Qassim Ahmed Taki, Iraq's oil minister, said today. **********OPEC officials would not discuss whether the 7 percent reduction would be made from the temporary, reduced levels agreed to in August and October or from the previous quotas. **********The 13-member group met in full session tonight for the first time since Monday. According to delegates, the group has tentatively agreed to exempt Iraq from the pact, but such a move would cast doubt on the effectiveness of the accord. Oil Prices Climb Higher **********OPEC representatives will meet again Friday both to discuss the technical issue of price ''differentials'' for various grades of crude oil and to try to settle on an overall agreement. On news of today's OPEC session, open-market oil prices, which had dropped earlier in the day, rebounded. For example, the benchmark North Sea oil, Brent crude, rose about 20 cents, to $15.50 a barrel.  [ Page D16. ]  Delegates warned that the final agreement was not yet assured. Iran, which has been at war with Iraq for more than six years, remains dissatisfied with exempting its foe from the output curbs. Indeed, the conflict between the Iran and Iraq has been the main hurdle to an agreement throughout this OPEC session, now in its eighth day. **********But Iran has apparently come around, with reluctance, to the view that even an accord that exempts Iraq is better than the loss of OPEC credibility and the lower prices likely to result from failing to reach an agreement. **********One of the options considered in recent days, according to delegates, was exempting both Iraq and Iran from production cuts. But it would be painless for Iran to join the production accord because Iraqi bombing raids have already reduced Iran's production well below its old quota of 2.3 million barrels a day. Iraqi Capacity Has Grown **********But Iraq faces an opposite situation. Its previous quota, set in 1984 after its export capacity had been decimated by Iranian naval action in the Persian Gulf, was 1.2 million barrels a day. Iraq has rebuilt its export capacity by enlarging one pipeline through Turkey and linking into another across the Saudi desert to the Red Sea. **********Iraq's current production is estimated at more than 1.6 million barrels a day and, with pipeline additions under way, it may increase its capacity to 2.3 million barrels by next spring. **********Iraq was exempted from two temporary production cuts in August and October, but Iran insisted that the Iraqi exemption could not continue indefinitely. **********Saudi Arabia, which supports Iraq's war effort with oil and substantial loans, has tried to use its leverage to persuade Iraq to join the output accord. It has not succeeded so far. 'One of the Major Players' **********''Iraq is making a political point,'' said Mehdi Varzi, a former Iranian diplomat who is now an oil analyst for Kleinwort Grieveson & Company, a London-based brokerage house. ''It is showing Saudi Arabia and Iran that it is one of the major players in OPEC.'' **********If a production pact exempting Iraq is agreed upon, a key issue will be whether the cuts from OPEC's 12 other members will be sufficient to push prices toward $18 a barrel, the stated objective of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. **********Currently, OPEC is producing about 17 million barrels of oil a day. A 7 percent reduction by 12 nations would trim the total by about 900,000 barrels a day, which analysts say should be enough to keep prices firm and rising. Since the meeting in Geneva began, open-market oil prices have advanced more than $1.50 a barrel on expectations of a pact. **********For an accord to push prices higher, there must be some assurance that Iraqi output will not surge. Earlier, Iraq's representatives said they would ''cooperate'' with an OPEC cutback, even if they did not formally join it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/22/world/around-the-world-a-strong-thatcher-ally-resigns-from-cabinet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A STRONG THATCHER ALLY RESIGNS FROM CABINET", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; A STRONG THATCHER ALLY RESIGNS FROM CABINET", "body_text": " **********Sir Keith Joseph, a hard-line Conservative and one of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's staunchest supporters in the party, stepped down as Education Minister today.

But analysts said the pickup did not signal a return to boom times. **********The analysts predicted renewed strength in construction of single-family homes, as buyers react to lower mortgage rates, but they said apartment building was likely to continue to nose-dive as a result of high vacancy rates and the impact of pending changes in the tax code. **********This will mean that housing, a bright spot in the economy this year, will not provide much of a lift to growth in coming months, the analysts said. A 1.82-Million Rate **********The Commerce Department's housing report said the four-tenths of 1 percent rise in August left construction of new homes and apartments at an annual rate of 1.82 million units, still down substantially from the early part of the year, when housing starts were running at a rate of 2 million units. **********Analysts said there was little chance activity would return to those levels because of continued weakness in construction of multifamily units. **********They noted that building permits, a good barometer of future activity, fell a sharp 6 percent in August to an annual rate of 1.65 million units. The decline was led by a 8.2 percent drop in permits for apartment buildings, which fell to their lowest level since March 1983. **********Analysts predicted further declines in apartment construction as developers look at vacancy rates, which are at the highest levels in 10 years, and begin to assess the impact of the pending tax overhaul legislation, which removes many of the tax subsidies for rental housing. ''Multifamily builders are shutting down production; next year looks pretty dismal for them,'' said Michael Sumichrast, economist at the National Association of Home Builders. Multifamily Drop Offset **********In August, the strength in construction came from a 3 percent rise in starts of single-family units, which offset a 4.3 percent drop in construction of multifamily units. **********Single-family homes were built at an annual rate of 1.2 million units, while construction of multifamily units totaled an annual pace of 625,000. **********Housing construction had fallen 2 percent in July, after declines of one-tenth of a percent in June and a big 8.2 percent in May. **********Despite the weaker numbers, construction for the year is running 8.3 percent ahead of the pace in the first eight months of 1985. Housing analysts said this will insure the best year for the industry since 1978. Steep Dip in Mortgage Rates **********The strong market for single-family homes has been spurred by steep declines in mortgage interest rates. Rates have fallen to the lowest levels of this decade, dropping below 10 percent again in late August. **********A survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation found fixed-rate mortgages averaging 9.96 percent last week. Analysts said they expected little variation from this level for the rest of the year. **********''I think mortgage rates will stay close to 10 percent, perhaps dropping to 9.75 percent or rising to 10.25 percent, but staying in a very narrow band for the balance of 1986,'' said Ronald Poe, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/23/world/us-is-said-to-have-given-pretoria-intelligence-on-rebel-organization.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2873, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. IS SAID TO HAVE GIVEN PRETORIA INTELLIGENCE ON REBEL ORGANIZATION", "print_headline": "U.S. IS SAID TO HAVE GIVEN PRETORIA INTELLIGENCE ON REBEL ORGANIZATION", "body_text": " **********The United States, working closely with British intelligence, has provided South Africa with intelligence about the banned and exiled African National Congress, according to current and former Government officials. **********The congress is the principal guerrilla group seeking the overthrow of the South African Government and the end of apartheid. **********A senior Administration official, who did not wish to be named, categorically denied today that any intelligence on the African National Congress had been exchanged between the United States and South Africa. Warnings of Planned Attacks **********But the present and former officials interviewed for this article said the information, including political intelligence as well as specific warnings of planned attacks by the group, was given to South Africa by the Reagan Administration at least into the mid-1980's, although they did not specify when during the Reagan years it began. South Africa, in return, has reported on Soviet and Cuban activities in the region, the sources said. **********It could not be determined whether the United States was still providing information on the African National Congress. Nor could it be learned whether South Africa had used the information to prevent African National Congress attacks or to prepare for South African raids on the congress's bases in Mozambique and elsewhere in southern Africa. **********Because South Africa has no satellite intelligence ability, the sources said, it has been dependent on the United States and Britain for communications intelligence from the black nations in Africa beyond the range of its own interception equipment. A Change in Policy **********The sources, who include former White House aides in the Reagan and Carter Administrations, said the United States and South Africa had exchanged sensitive intelligence under an arrangement dating from the 1960's. But they said the data initially concerned Soviet shipping and submarine movements in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean. **********The sharing of information about the African National Congress with the South African Directorate of Military Intelligence was described as part of a reversal of a policy established under the Carter Administration, which had banned any sharing of intelligence with South Africa. It could not be learned whether President Reagan or any of his senior advisers specifically ordered or acquiesced in the policy change. **********President Reagan, in a speech today at the White House, criticized what he called ''elements of the African National Congress'' for creating conditions that could lead eventually to ''racial war.'' **********Edward P. Djerejian, a White House spokesman, asked for comment about the sources' account, said, ''We simply do not discuss or comment on intelligence operations or alleged intelligence operations.'' **********Senior officials of the State Department, the Defense Department and the South African Embassy in Washington, informed last week of the former and current Administration officials' accounts, also said they would have no comment. **********Some Reagan Administration officials acknowledged that disclosure of United States-South African intelligence-sharing would heighten the rebel group's suspicions about the Administration's intentions and policies on South Africa. **********American intelligence officials said a special focus of the intelligence shared with the South African Directorate of Military Intelligence originated from the interception of communications between the African National Congress headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, its guerrilla training camps in Angola and its offices in Africa and Western Europe. **********Most of the conversations are conducted ''in the clear'' - that is, uncoded - and the electronic ''take'' has included specific advance information on planned bombings and disruptions by the congress, officials said. Administration Debate Over Group's Ideology Many of Mr. Reagan's senior national security officials, the sources asserted in interviews, took office convinced that the leadership of the African National Congress was dominated by pro-Soviet Communists, and that providing South Africa with information on the group was in the American national interest. **********Other officials, including current members of the Administration, disagree with this view, arguing that the congress is primarily a nationalist group whose views must be taken into consideration. **********Last year, the State Department publicly urged South Africa to take part in talks with the African National Congress and to release its imprisoned leader, Nelson Mandela. A senior official was quoted as saying that United States policy called for South Africa to be ''reaching as broadly and widely as it can,'' including contacts with the African National Congress. **********The African National Congress has been recognized by the United Nations General Assembly and the Organization of African Unity as a national liberation movement. It has offices in more than 30 countries. **********''It all comes down to what you believe about the A.N.C.,'' one former senior Reagan Administration official said in acknowledging that communications intelligence on the organization had been relayed to South Africa. He described the congress as a dangerous revolutionary organization controlled by Communists and said, ''Our interests require helping the South Africans.'' **********An intelligence officer now serving in the Reagan Administration, acknowledging that the African National Congress had been a major target of American intelligence-gathering, said: ''I've known about it for a long time, that we target the A.N.C. We've always considered them to be the bad guys, to be Soviet pawns, stalking horses for the Soviets.'' **********South Africa, in a Government booklet published early last month, asserted that 23 of the 30 members of the congress's executive committee ''are known to have membership with'' the South African Communist Party, which was outlawed in 1950. **********Oliver Tambo, the group's president in exile, acknowledged in a newspaper interview last year that there was ''an overlapping of membership'' between the two groups, but said: ''It is often suggested that the A.N.C. is controlled by the Communist Party, by Communists. Well, I have been long enough in the A.N.C. to know that that has never been true.'' **********In his speech today, President Reagan cited what he called ''the calculated terror by elements of the African National Congress - the mining of roads, the bombings of public places, designed to bring about further repression, the imposition of martial law, and eventually creating the conditions for racial war.'' **********At another point in the speech, Mr. Reagan referred to the ''Soviet-armed guerrillas of the African National Congress, operating both within South Africa and from some neighboring countries,'' which he said had ''embarked upon new acts of terrorism inside South Africa.'' **********The President, saying he condemned recent South African attacks on neighboring black-ruled countries, said of the African National Congress: ''I also condemn that behavior.'' Despite Restrictions, A Continued Flow Shortly after taking office in 1977, the Carter Administration ordered a ban on the sharing of any intelligence with South Africa, the sources said. But they said intelligence on Soviet and Cuban activities in southern Africa nonetheless continued to flow to South Africa, apparently because elements in United States intelligence agencies chose to evade the ban. **********The sources said no intelligence on the African National Congress was forwarded to South Africa before 1981, when President Reagan took office. **********The sources for the account included a former member of the National Security Agency who said he disagreed with the policy of sharing intelligence with South Africa. **********Senior American intelligence officials acknowledged that there is a general understanding among United States intelligence agencies prohibiting the passing of intelligence about a second country to a third. **********''If you're asked by a third country what you saw in a second country,'' a senior Reagan Administration intelligence official said, ''you're not to respond.'' Exceptions are made for Britain, some other selected Atlantic allies and Israel, the officials said, but all other contacts are to be authorized in advance. **********Former officials of the National Security Agency, describing the nature of the intelligence-sharing relationship, said the agency had traditionally relied on the South African Directorate of Military Intelligence for data on Soviet shipping and submarine activities around the Cape of Good Hope and in the Indian Ocean. **********American representatives of the National Security Agency were posted at Silvermine, a South African intelligence installation near Cape Town, by the early 1970's, and reports on Soviet shipping were routinely flowing from South Africa to the National Security Agency's headquarters at Fort Meade, Md., according to former officials of the agency. **********Most of those reports, they said, were relayed through installations of the Government Communications Headquarters, the British counterpart of the National Security Agency and the United States' closest ally in the collection and distribution of communications intelligence worldwide. **********Officials said South Africa's intelligence installations were vastly expanded in the mid-1970's, as the Soviet Union and Cuba became directly involved, along with the Central Intelligence Agency and South Africa, in the civil war that broke out in Angola after the Portuguese withdrew in 1975. **********Former National Security Agency officials said vast quantities of electronic equipment, including antennas and sophisticated interception receivers, were secretly shipped from Britain and West Germany to South Africa to enable the South Africans to build more listening sites. **********American-made computer chips and other electronic components were involved in the shipments, according to former White House aides, although under Presidential directives against such shipments to South Africa the components could have been barred. The shipment of such materials was initially barred by President Kennedy, and later Administrations continued the ban, at least publicly. **********But national security officials of the Ford Administration chose to look to look the other way, the sources said, in a successful effort to avoid any public debate over the American and British role in aiding South Africa's intelligence abilities. **********In the Carter Administration, Richard M. Moose, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, ordered an end to all collaboration on communications intelligence between the United States and South Africa. Former officials of the National Security Agency said the liaison nonetheless continued, with South Africa continuing to report on Soviet submarine and shipping activity. **********''Moose thought he had stopped it,'' a senior Carter Administration official recalled, ''but the Navy really went bonkers on this and it wasn't stopped.'' **********There was no reason to believe that the National Security Agency was then sharing with the South Africans any of its separately collected intelligence on the black countries south of the Sahara, including Angola, Zambia and Mozambique, the official added. Shopping Lists Exchanged in Britain A former National Security Agency officer, discussing the British role in the sharing of intelligence with South Africa, recalled attending a high-level meeting in the mid-1980's at the headquarters of the Government Communications Headquarters at Cheltenham, 90 miles northwest of London. At the meeting, he said, senior American and British officials reviewed previous intelligence assignments and future targets - a process known in intelligence jargon as ''tasking.'' **********After long discussions of American and British interception programs involving the Soviet Union and the Middle East, the officials turned to Africa. The meeting was led by a British representative of the Government Communications Headquarters with a small group of American intelligence officials, including two senior officials from National Security Agency headquarters, actively taking part. **********At this point, the former National Security Agency officer said, three South African military intelligence officers were ushered into the room. The South Africans and the British exchanged tasking requirements - sophisticated documents outlining previous communications intelligence targets, such as a third-world embassy, and the frequencies on which they relayed intelligence and other communications. **********According to the former official, the delegations from the American and British agencies asked South Africa to continue its efforts to monitor Soviet and Cuban activity in Angola and Mozambique, as well as Soviet shipping and submarine activity around the Cape of Good Hope. **********The South Africans were asked to provide their reports on Soviet and Cuban activity on a weekly basis, instead of reporting monthly, as they had in the past. Other targets were to include Soviet commercial and economic activity south of the Sahara, with special emphasis on support for the rebels in South-West Africa, or Namibia, where South Africa has been engaged in a guerrilla war with the South-West Africa People's Organization. **********In return, a participant said, the South African delegation had its own requirements for American and British intelligence. Two copies of a South African document were turned over, outlining previous targets for the United States and Britain and new targets to be added to the day-to-day intelligence collection. **********These included a South African request that an extensive array of political, military, diplomatic and economic activity south of the Sahara be collected and relayed to Pretoria, including intercepted information dealing with the Governments of Angola, Mozambique, Zambia and Botswana, the former National Security Agency official recalled. **********''I saw the list,'' the former official said, ''and they also wanted any and all tasking related to the A.N.C., including the movements of Oliver Tambo. We got a list of 10 people of Tambo's staff - the A.N.C. high command - and they wanted information from us.'' **********The South African request ''appeared routine'' and ''nobody seemed surprised about it,'' the officer said, although he recalled his personal surprise at how ''extensive'' the cooperation was between the South Africans and the United States and Britain. **********One specific request for the United States was to monitor the international travel of Mr. Tambo and report when he was taking flights aboard Soviet and Cuban airlines. There was also specific mention of the frequencies on which the Governments of Zambia, Mozambique, Angola and Tanzania transmitted intelligence and diplomatic information; the National Security Agency and the Government Communications Headquarters were asked to monitor those frequencies for items of interest to South Africa, the former official said. A 'Special Emphasis' On Guerrilla Group **********Most important, the former official said, the South Africans made what was known among intelligence officials as a ''special emphasis'' request from the South Africans for the African National Congress's communications. **********The South Africans listed the frequencies used by the rebel group and the pattern of when they talked, the official said. It was clear, the official added, that the South African Directorate of Military Intelligence was unable to independently intercept all of the communications it deemed essential. **********The African National Congress's communication system was arranged much like a normal military command, the South Africans explained, with military communications dominating the traffic by day and political and covert activities discussed at night. The former National Security Agency official said most of the interceptions of African National Congress communications in Zambia were the responsibility of the Government Communications Headquarters, the British agency, which has far more extensive communications intelligence coverage in Africa than the National Security Agency. **********By the early 1980's, the former official said, the African National Congress was considered by the National Security Agency to have the status of an international organization, such as the Palestine Liberation Organization, and assigned surveillance to what was then known in the agency as the G-Group, which is responsible for the monitoring of all non-Communist countries. **********Former National Security Agency officials described tasking conferences, such as the one in Cheltenham, as designed to carry out previously established policy. Inevitably, the number of targets whose signals are to be intercepted expands with each conference. The conferences are normally held more than once a year. **********It could not be learned which of the South African requests were new or simply reiterations of previously agreed-upon targets. Senior Carter Administration intelligence officials said, however, that no such tasking conferences took place before 1981. **********Many of the targets included in the South African tasking document, the participant said, were designated by what is known in the National Security Agency as ''case notation,'' letter and number designators that enable the collected data to be properly routed by computer in the vast information retrieval systems used by the agency and by British intelligence. **********Former National Security Agency officials said the fact that African National Congress targets were installed in the case notation system was evidence that the information-sharing arrangement was permanent, not ad hoc. **********''To put it in case notation,'' an official said, ''means that it's an institutional and organized effort. It allows you to technically manage the issue.'' **********Such exchanges have taken place in the past, other officials of the agency noted, especially with countries in those areas of the world where the agency and its British counterpart have little intelligence coverage, such as in South Africa. **********''In some cases,'' a former senior National Security Agency official explained, the liaison ''ran counter to diplomacy or larger moral issues.'' **********''What the Fort does is considered technical and not diplomatic,'' the former official added, referring to the agency's headquarters at Fort Meade, and it is rarely if ever shared with the State Department. The National Security Agency's attitude toward questions of diplomacy or morality, the former official added, is: ''So what? On a worldwide basis we need the coverage.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/17/business/advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 28, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ACCOUNTS", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; ACCOUNTS", "body_text": " **********Accounts *********** Mercury Marine to Campbell-Mithun, Minneapolis, for Mercury brand outboard motors. *********** Group Health Inc. of Minneapolis to BBDO/Minneapolis. *********** Chrysler Credit Corporation to Ross Roy Inc., Detroit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/05/business/advertising-handling-ad-clients-in-mideast.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 605, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Handling Ad Clients In Mideast", "print_headline": "Advertising; Handling Ad Clients In Mideast", "body_text": " **********WITH the international travel market in a spin from terrorism these days, it would seem the least-sought-after advertising clients would be those connected with the Middle East. **********Biederman & Company has two such clients - Israel tourism being one of them - but Barry Biederman, who founded the agency two years ago, is not without hope. **********''Now the whole world is seized with fear, but I think in time we can make a dent in the situation and eventually overcome it,'' he said. **********Mr. Biederman is not whistling in the dark. Drawing on his past experience with the Israel account, he knows what can be done with advertising in such situations. **********He took over the Israel Ministry of Tourism's assignment in the nervous days just after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon when there was, he said, ''a major decline in tourism.'' **********He created an ad campaign based on ''Come to Israel. Come stay with friends.'' With this effort, he said, ''We arrested the slide and had three back-to-back record tourist years.'' **********Mr. Biederman, who has been doing the corporate advertising for ITT since the days when that multinational company's image went sour because of various political involvements, is not going to ignore the current international situation with his Israel advertising. His plan is to set up telephone interviews with American tourists vacationing in Israel and use their own descriptions of the good time they are having for radio commercials. **********Those will be considered tactical ads within the ''Stay With Friends'' strategic image effort. **********The other client involved with the Middle East is Tower Air, an American-flag charter carrier that flies the world and also runs scheduled flights to Israel via Brussels. In its consumer advertising for the scheduled flights, it uses print advertising with such headlines as ''Now it takes two hours less to go back 4,000 years.'' **********On the tactical side the airline has a trade ad (aimed at travel agents) that quotes two well-known tour operators on why they would recommend a charter flight to Greece. They talk about the higher quality of security on charter flights. **********''You can't tell people the world doesn't exist,'' said Mr. Biederman in defense of his frankness. **********If that sounds like a hard-nosed newspaperman, there's a reason. That was the direction Mr. Biederman's career first took, leading him, after Cornell, to the Columbia journalism school and then to the London School of Economics. Afterward there was a trip to India for a news-related adventure. **********When he returned from being an unrecognized foreign correspondent, he became an editor of Town & Village, a neighborhood publication, and this experience prepared him for the ad agency business when the call came. It came first from Mogul, Williams & Saylor, then from Lennen & Newell, Cunningham & Walsh, where he created ''Mrs. Olson'' for Folger coffee and finally to Needham, Harper & Steers, where for the next 18 years he climbed the stairs to director of creative services. **********Toward the end of that illustrious phase of his career, he formed a special Needham unit to specialize in corporate advertising. It was this unit that spun off to become the independent Biederman organization. In the last four months it has been getting an account a month. **********Mr. Biederman figures that the agency, now situated at 100 Fifth Avenue, will end the year billing at the rate of $36 million - quite nice considering that in 1984, an eight-month year for the agency, it billed just $14 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/27/business/company-news-sec-accuses-pr-executive.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

Marcos's departure from the Philippines yesterday put an end to an era - the tumultuous two decades he spent as the nation's President. **********Mr. Marcos, now an ailing 68 years old, made a name for himself as a brilliant, strong-willed lawyer, military man and Senator before he was first elected President in 1965, taking command of the Philippines' ramshackle but functioning democracy. **********''Politics,'' he said early in his career, ''galvanizes into action all the beautiful hopes that a man can nurture in his heart for his country and for his nation. Politics is my life.'' **********Yet as his presidency unfolded, he imposed martial law in 1972 and managed to retain broad powers after lifting it in 1981, including the prerogative of governing by decree if he so desired. **********Even so, Mr. Marcos's imposing presence, his ringing orator's voice, his skilled sleight-of-hand with his Government, were not enough to keep his power from shriveling in recent years. His health and energy declined, the political opposition mounted and grew bolder, and a Communist guerrilla movement spread through the countryside. Economy Undermines Power **********His popularity and prestige were partly undermined late in his tenure by the Philippine economy, which appeared sputtering and dilapidated when compared with the prosperity of such other Asian countries as Singapore and Taiwan. **********During his years in power, his critics charge, Philippine economic development, despite some advances, fell far short of achieving the potential of the country's fertile landscape and its energetic and swiftly expanding population, now more than 50 million. **********One reason for the economic shortfall, the critics contend, is that his Government failed to plan effectively: it placed too much faith in large business concerns that proved inefficient, and it left the country too dependent on the production of basic commodities. These critics also charge that the economy was sapped and undercut by corruption on the part of Mr. Marcos and people close to him. **********Even before the Marcos era, Philippine politics were oligarchic and elitist, largely dominated by families whose influence went back for generations. Mr. Marcos was himself the son of a provincial political strongman, and in his own heyday he made power and privilege in his homeland even more dependent on personal ties. Reports of Enormous Riches **********Many of his associates grew richer and richer, profiting one way or another from Government and personal ties. He and his wife, Imelda, grew enormously rich, amassing, by some accounts, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of real estate and antiques in the New York area alone. **********Yet besides buttressing Mr. Marcos's rule, the Filipino web of dynastic ties eventually helped bring him down. After the assassination of the main opposition leader, Benigno S. Aquino Jr., in 1983, his widow, Corazon C. Aquino - herself from a politically powerful family - galvanized and focused the opposition by opposing Mr. Marcos in the presidential election Feb. 7. **********The election was held after Mr. Marcos had suggested that it be scheduled early this year to give him, he said, a ''fresh mandate.'' That proved to be a politically fatal misstep. **********His Government asserted that he outpolled Mrs. Aquino, but it was widely accused of using fraud and violence to keep her from winning. During the campaign, as before, Marcos supporters were accused of bringing about the death of Mrs. Aquino's husband, and doubts were cast on Mr. Marcos's description of his own guerrilla heroism in World War II. Son of Former President **********Mrs. Aquino's running mate, former Senator Salvador H. Laurel, was himself heir to a powerful though controversial political heritage as the son of Jose P. Laurel, who was the Philippines' puppet President during the Japanese occupation in World War II. **********Juan Ponce Enrile, the former Defense Minister who became one of the two main leaders of the anti-Marcos rebellion that sprung up last weekend, was a longtime political and business associate of Mr. Marcos's entourage who had prospered in the coconut business. **********It was a purported assassination plot in 1972 against Mr. Enrile, then already his country's defense chief, that Mr. Marcos used as his reason for declaring martial law, which was a key step in enlarging his powers after he had been President for seven years. Mr. Enrile acknowledged last weekend that the plot had been faked. **********Mr. Marcos came to office in 1965 by defeating President Diosdado Macapagal in an bitterly fought election that was largely swayed by voters' resentment over high prices, agricultural problems and criminality in Philippine life. Called Murderer and Thief **********He won although President Macapagal called him a murderer - he had earlier won acquittal in the murder of a political foe of his father - as well as ''a thief, a swindler, a forger and a threat to the country.'' **********As President, Mr. Marcos promised ''with the help of the masses to make this country great again.'' He energetically set about slashing the Government payroll, enhancing the rice supply and increasing the construction of schools, highways, medical centers and the like. **********He liked to speak of what he called the enterprising, diligent ''new Filipino.'' **********''In all this part of the world,'' he said in those days, ''where will democratic ways work if they fail here?'' Exhorting his followers, he once said, ''Our nation can be great only according to the scale of our own labors, our dedication, our self-abnegation.'' **********In the presidential election of 1969 -after which, as after numerous elections down the years, there were various charges of cheating - Mr. Marcos won 60 percent of the vote. He thereby became the first President of the Philippines to win re-election since the country gained its independence from the United States in 1946. Protests and Insurgencies **********Yet as his second term went on, he was beset by problems. Agricultural issues festered; the sprawling capital, Manila, was racked by student protests; Moslem rebels and other insurgents prowled parts of the countryside. **********Then, in late 1972, Mr. Marcos, after asserting that the Government was not functioning properly, and after the purported attempt on Mr. Enrile's life, declared martial law throughout the country. Numbers of his political rivals and critics - including young people and journalists - were arrested. Properties of his opponents, including newspapers, television stations and business concerns, were seized. **********He also moved in other ways to build up his power, and in doing so he later said he had been ''guided by God.'' He suspended the Philippine Congress, built up the military establishment - a key prop for his rule - and designated himself Prime Minister under a new Constitution. Arrests continued in the succeeding years. **********So effective were these measures that, in the later 1970's, when he and his wife sat in public on matching high-backed gold throne chairs, the chairs were widely seen as a symbol of the martial-law Government. Charges of Vote Fraud **********He repeatedly won high percentages of the vote in referendums he called during martial law, but many Filipinos believed that the number of votes cast for him had been fraudulently exaggerated. **********On the internal-security front, he quelled the street demonstrations and did away with numerous gangs and private armies by seizing their weapons. In the economic sphere, he went forward with public-works construction in addition to land redistribution, and logged some other gains. **********But critics reported that the business interests of members of the Marcos circle flowered during martial law. A Marcos golf partner, Herminio Disini, who was related by marriage to Mrs. Marcos, advanced in five years from a tobacco-company post to the proprietorship of a conglomerate with assets worth more than $500 million. **********In 1981, the year that Mr. Marcos ended martial law, he also stepped down as Prime Minister and won re-election as President for the second time in a vote that was boycotted by his leading political foes. The next Presidential election was scheduled to come in 1987, until Mr. Marcos moved to have it this year instead. In 1981, he also made himself the head of his political party, the New Society Movement, succeeding his wife. An Exile Is Killed **********Nonetheless, as the 1980's went on, Mr. Marcos's rule was increasingly buffeted by accusations and opposition. A turning point came in 1983 with the slaying of Mr. Aquino - by a bullet to the head - as he came back to Manila after spending years of self-exile in the United States. **********The killing, widely ascribed to the Marcos camp, touched off anti-Marcos rioting that in turn shook the economy, alarming business executives. In 1984, the opposition achieved gains in elections to the National Assembly. Another potent factor working against Mr. Marcos was opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, led by the influential Jaime Cardinal Sin. **********All the while, the Marcos Government's weaknesses were underscored by the growth of the Communist insurgent movement, which fed on mounting popular discontent - although leftist leaders boycotted the presidential election earlier this month. **********The Communist New People's Army is said to have as many as 30,000 members according to some estimates, far more people, spread far more widely across the country, than it had when Mr. Marcos took office. As President, Mr. Marcos argued that his rule was necessary to confront the Communist insurgents, but his critics abroad as well as at home came to contend that, to prevent further Communist inroads, his tenure must be brought to an end. Verdict in Aquino Slaying **********Mr. Marcos's grip on his country was already too much weakened by December 1985 to benefit from a court verdict in that month that, after a protracted trial, found a score of defendants, mainly military men, not guilty in Mr. Aquino's slaying. The verdict struck many Filipinos as unjust and fueled popular discontent. **********Late in 1985 the presidential campaign gave a forum for ringing denunciations of Mr. Marcos's Government, with Mrs. Aquino promising her supporters that she would gain justice for all of the people she called the Government's victims, including her husband. **********Then, after Mr. Marcos claimed victory in the election Feb. 7, his grip was broken at last by a wave of outrage and disapproval that had repercussions that swiftly brought him down. **********Before long, the Reagan Administration accused Mr. Marcos of fraud and called for his departure - despite the fact that the United States had earlier showered him with support and compliments, including praise by Vice President Bush at Mr. Marcos's last inauguration in June 1981 for his ''adherence to democratic principles.'' **********Meanwhile, Mr. Enrile and Lieut. Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, the former deputy Chief of Staff of the armed services, had mounted their rebellion, which sent hundreds of thousands of ordinary Filipinos surging into Manila's boulevards to support the rebels and underscore demands that the Marcos era, at long last, must end."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/15/business/futures-options-oil-prices-at-lowest-in-years.html": {"writer_name": "Lee Daniels", "pub_date": "1986-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 749, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OIL PRICES AT LOWEST IN YEARS", "print_headline": "FUTURES/OPTIONS; OIL PRICES AT LOWEST IN YEARS", "body_text": " **********Prices of some crude oil and petroleum products fell yesterday to their lowest levels in years on the world oil market.

Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Intstitute for International Economics. ''But it's been exacerbated by the gulf producers turning more oil out of the spigot.'' **********According to Mr. Verleger and other analysts, the latest round of price drops resulted from the recent sharp increases in crude oil production by OPEC nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. **********Two respected trade publications, Petroleum Intelligence Weekly and Platt's Oilgram, said yesterday that OPEC's output for July would average 19.5 million barrels a day, coming on top of an estimated 19 million barrels a day last month. This, analysts said, has added at least 1.5 million barrels a day to the already-glutted world oil market. OPEC ministers suggested in April that 17.5 million barrels a day would be a suitable production ceiling - if the organization's members could agree on it. **********Saudi Arabia's production is said to have reached at least 5.2 million barrels a day, and Kuwait's output is thought to be more than one million barrels a day for the first time in about eight years. **********Jack Shaughnessy, an analyst at Wood, Mackenzie & Company, said those reports were the immediate cause of the Brent oil's sharp drop yesterday. The British blend, which had been in the $9-a-barrel range since last week, reportedly was sold as low as $8.75 for a single cargo. **********However, Mr. Shaughnessy and others said that the new estimates of OPEC production - and the fact that these cargoes were on their way to American and European ports to join the already huge surplus of crude oil - were affecting the entire oil market equally. **********Dubai's crude oil traded yesterday at $6.75 a barrel for August delivery, its lowest level since 1973. Mr. Verleger said he would not be surprised to see several crude oils, including the Arab heavy grades, trade in the range of $5 to $6 a barrel. **********The benchmark American crude, West Texas Intermediate, has lost $1.74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange since OPEC ended its meeting at Brioni, Yugoslavia, on June 30 without a production accord. **********West Texas Intermediate closed yesterday in futures trading at $11.04 a barrel, down 9 cents, and on the open market at $11 a barrel, down 10 cents. **********The near-term futures contract for heating oil sank just below 30 cents a gallon in early trading.

American society is described about as charitably as the Soviet Union would be depicted at a convention of the Democratic or the Republican Party. **********Looking at the world through a Marxist-Leninist prism, Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in his keynote speech on Tuesday: **********''The capitalism of the 1980's, the capitalism of the age of electronics and computer science, computers and robots, is leaving more millions of people, including young and educated people, without jobs. **********''Wealth and power are being increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. Militarism is gorging itself on the arms race.'' A Critique of Capitalism **********Mr. Gorbachev devoted a large part of his speech to a biting critique of capitalism, a sort of state-of-the-art Marxist analysis of the West. **********The United States, he said, remains a strong and dangerous opponent, but American society is slowly unraveling because of fundamental contradictions in the capitalist system. **********Hedging a bit on traditional Soviet predictions that capitalism would eventually collapse, he said, ''The present stage in the general crisis does not lead to absolute stagnation of capitalism and does not rule out possible growth of its economy.'' **********The criticism seemed to undermine his conclusion that Communist nations must cooperate more closely with the West to avoid nuclear war, prevent environmental pollution and improve the quality of life. **********Western diplomats suggested that Mr. Gorbachev took a hard position on ideological issues to assuage conservatives who might question his proposals for economic change and to make it easier for him to critize Soviet failings. **********Marshal Nikolai V. Ogarkov, the former Chief of the General Staff, who was abruptly replaced two years ago, has appeared at the congress, among the delegates. A Soviet military officer said Marshal Ogarkov still held an important military post, but declined to specify what it was. The party congress is dry. In the spirit of Mr. Gorbachev's campaign against drinking, there is not a bottle of vodka or other alcoholic beverage to be found. **********A manager at the Rossiya Hotel, where delegates are housed, said there was a ban on the consumption of liquor during the congress. **********The same holds for the press center, which sometimes seems to be the setting for a variation on a theme by Luigi Pirandello - 2,000 journalists in search of a drink. **********A Soviet official, guiding a foreign reporter around the center, noted that the second floor bar had been enlarged. The main addition, he said, is a new espresso machine. **********Self-criticism is in vogue at the congress. **********Following the lead of Mr. Gorbachev, who acknowledged Tuesday that all was not well in the party and in the nation and that his efforts to revitalize the economy were not uniformly successful, other leaders offered mea culpas today. **********Premier Vitaly I. Vorotnikov of the Russian Republic, the most important of the Soviet Union's 15 states, discussed development problems in his republic. He noted that there had been shortcomings in economic management. **********Boris N. Yeltsin, the Moscow city chief, said there was stagnation in the city's economy. **********Although he placed much of the blame on the previous city leadership, he also criticized Central Committee departments for intervening in economic affairs. **********Broadening his field of reference, he said, ''Why do we raise a number of the very same problems congress after congress?'' **********Then, adding a personal touch, he acknowledged that he had failed to do his part to prevent the stagnation because he did not have sufficient courage. **********The Soviet authorities, who have been warming up to Western-style news conferences in recent years, have abandoned any lingering reservations during the congress. **********Four or five briefings are being offered daily at the press center. The occasions today were a discussion of Mr. Gorbachev's economic program, a meeting with delegates from Leningrad and a meeting with a group of West German Communists. **********The day ended with an appearance by Gen.

But when asked today whether the President would sign the Packwood plan as is, Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, replied, ''Not as it stands now.'' The Packwood proposal is to be used as a starting point for the committee when it begins drafting a bill on Wednesday. **********''There are some things in it that we will want to have changed,'' Mr. Regan said, ''but we think it's a good, working document.'' It was unclear whether those changes would prove a stumbling block to the committee's deliberations since Mr. Regan did not identify what changes he had in mind. **********But he said in an interview on the NBC News television program ''Meet the Press'' that the Packwood plan ''covers'' the major points that President Reagan said were needed to win his approval. Those demands, which were spelled out in a letter last December to House Republicans, included a top 35 percent rate, a $2,000 personal exemption for most taxpayers and improved investment incentives. **********Mr. Regan said the Administration wanted to assess the economic effects of the plan, including a proposal to raise about $75 billion over five years through excise tax changes, which he called a ''novel idea.'' **********Despite the reservations voiced by Mr. Regan, the White House has viewed the Packwood plan as a substantial improvement over the version approved by the House of Representatives three months ago. And many opponents of the House-passed bill are now sounding more amenable to the idea of tax revision, although the Packwood proposal has also alienated some ardent supporters of tax revision in the House. **********''There is both great joy and great despair,'' said Nicholas E. Calio, an executive of the Tax Reform Action Coalition, a group of some 200 corporations and associations that endorsed the House bill. **********The Packwood plan retains many more investment and retirement incentives than the House bill and appeases oil, timber, mining, farming and manufacturing interests. But to pay for those changes, the plan imposed new tax burdens on smaller bankers, truckers, retailers and tobacco and liquor companies. **********Over all, Mr. Packwood was confident that he had picked up enough new allies to predict that a completed House-Senate tax bill would be on President Reagan's desk by Aug. 15. **********Indeed, Mr. Packwood's package was deftly crafted to meet both Mr. Reagan's demands and to accommodate the various interests of committee members, most of whom had little enthusiasm for tax revision. **********''It was cleverly constructed to gain support from people who were for lower rates but who otherwise were generally against tax reform,'' said Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine. **********Mr. Packwood, who represents the important Oregon timber area, proposed retaining all the current tax preferences for timber, as well as for domestic production of oil and gas and hard minerals. The House bill would scale back the tax benefits in all three areas. **********Mr. Packwood's decision pleased a number of committee members who are from oil, timber and mineral states, including Senator Mitchell and the committee's ranking Democrat, Russell E. Long of oil- and timber-rich Louisiana. Mr. Long praised the Packwood plan as a ''vast improvement'' over the bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House. **********''My feeling is that the chairman has raised the chances that there will be a tax-reform bill this year,'' said Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri. He was pleased that his proposal to make a research and development tax credit permanent was included in the plan and that Senator Packwood had heeded his request to retain the rehabilitation tax credit for historic buildings, albeit at reduced rates. **********Mr. Danforth was also grateful that Mr. Packwood did not entirely abolish the ''completed contract method of accounting.'' He said the House bill, which proposes eliminating this method of deferring tax payments, would have ''devastating consequences'' for the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Missouri's largest employer. **********Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, was granted his request for a provision that would allow farmers to deduct the cost of health insurance. Under the Packwood plan, self-employed workers could deduct 50 percent of their health insurance premiums. **********A $32 billion proposal to help steelmakers, farmers and other ailing industries by allowing them to immediately cash in 70 percent of their unused investment tax credits should help ease the concerns of Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, over the proposed repeal of the investment credit. **********Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said the Packwood plan would be ''good for New York State'' except for its treatment of state and local taxes. **********Under the Packwood proposal, the deduction for state and local sales and personal property taxes would be repealed and the value of the deduction of state and city income taxes would be cut back for taxpayers in the top bracket. Senator Moynihan vowed to continue to oppose changes in the deduction as a ''matter of principle.'' **********Opposition among other members, however, did not appear to be as great as it was early on in the House, which ultimately retained full deductibility. Mr. Packwood was prepared to defend his proposal, also on principle. Discounting the argument made by states that his approach would be unfair double taxation, Mr. Packwood said that 37 states did not allow for the deductibility of Federal taxes on state income tax returns. **********Elsewhere in his tax plan, Mr. Packwood was generous in trying to satisfy a concern over adequate investment incentives shared by most committee members, who tend to be more closely allied with business than their House counterparts. **********Depreciation write-offs for most types of machinery and equipment would remain unchanged from present law. And as a bonus, the system would be partly indexed for inflation. Real estate, however, would have to be written off over 30 years, versus 19 years now. As a $20 billion gift to small businesses, the plan would allow them to write off in the first year, instead of over a period of years, up to $50,000 in equipment and machinery, compared to $5,000 now. Capital Gains Rates Kept **********Mr. Packwood also decided to keep capital gains rates for both individuals and corporations at current levels, rather than increase them as the House proposed. **********Even though these changes drew praise from members, many of them also expressed concerns about some of the major provisions in the bill that are supposed to pay for the improved business incentives. The Packwood plan would increase excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco and motor fuel by about $13 billion over five years and abolish the business deduction for excise taxes and tariffs, a proposal that would raise about $62 billion more. **********Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-sponsored research group, called the proposal ''nothing but a huge consumption tax that will fall heavily on middle- and low-income families'' and more than wipe out the average 8.4 percent income tax cut for individuals projected under the plan. **********''We are not opposed to tax reform, but we will work against a package that has this in it,'' said Kenneth D. Simonson, director of tax policy at the American Truckers Association, one of the leading supporters of the House measure. The association was the host at a meeting last Friday of more than 30 representatives of the trucking, liquor, tobacco, aviation and retail industries to map out strategy. Campaign by Bankers **********Bankers were also upset. ''We are now mounting a full-court press with a grassroots campaign,'' said Kirk G. Willison, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association. The Packwood proposal would abolish the deduction for bad debt reserves for all banks. The House bill would repeal it only for the 450 biggest banks. **********Even some industries that received more favorable treatment under the Packwood plan are still trying to assess the impact of other parts of the plan, such as the revised alternative minimum tax. An aide at the Joint Committee on Taxation said the Packwood alternative tax on corporations was expected to raise much more money than the House version. **********And some tax economists were upset that Mr. Packwood had taken tax revision another step away from the original objective set forth by Treasury Department economists, to rid the tax code of enough special tax breaks to provide a level playing field for business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/04/business/digital-s-surprising-revival.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1986-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1526, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIGITAL'S SURPRISING REVIVAL", "print_headline": "DIGITAL'S SURPRISING REVIVAL", "body_text": " **********In the giant red-brick woolen mill where the Digital Equipment Corporation moved in as a start-up company nearly 30 years ago, the chatter in the hallways and offices keeps returning to one question: How long can Digital's remarkable revival last? **********''We talk about it every day,'' acknowledges William C. Hanson, the lanky, baldish chief of Digital's manufacturing operations. ''We can't believe our own snake oil. But this is more than just temporary - we're riding a new wave.'' **********The wave carrying Digital is one that virtually all its competitors -most notably the International Business Machines Corporation - have missed. **********Quarter after quarter, with the industry in the grips of the biggest computer slump in a decade, Digital has reported gains in revenues, earnings and operating margins that have repeatedly surprised Wall Street and offered a steady stream of new, easily connected products that appear to have worsened the angst at I.B.M. A Long-Awaited Model **********The latest of those products will be introduced Thursday, a long-awaited personal computer - Digital's first since the failure of its Rainbow two years ago - that provides the link between I.B.M.-compatible PC's and Digital's own line of VAX minicomputers. Far more significant, in the eyes of many industry experts, is a new hardware-and-software kit also making its debut, that allows users of I.B.M.'s own PC's to retrieve data instantly, and painlessly, from VAX computers of all sizes. Digital hopes that product will expand its market considerably, easing VAX machines into companies where I.B.M. PC's occupy most desk-tops. **********Because of major differences in circuit designs and operating systems, that is a significant technical feat. I.B.M. is still struggling to connect the PC to its own minicomputers, much less anyone else's, and finding a way to integrate millions of desk-top personal computers has long been considered essential to Digital's strategy of pushing companies to build computer networks of immense scale. **********This strategy has been mapped out chiefly by Digital's quirky, sometimes contradictory 60-year-old founder, Kenneth H. Olsen, who freely admits he is gambling much of Digital's future growth on the accuracy of his vision. **********After 30 years of designing some of the industry's most innovative midsized computers, and after watching the PC revolution pass Digital by, Mr. Olsen now maintains that American companies need a ''theological conversion,'' in which they buy computer networks first, and add the usual array of processors, printers and disk drives later on. A 'Backwards' Approach **********''The problem is that everyone's been going about this backwards -buying lots of computers and then trying to connect them together,'' Mr. Olsen said the other day at one of Digital's largest facilities, in Merrimack, N.H. ''We have to start thinking of the computers as peripherals. You start with the network, then you hang the computers on later.'' **********That strategy, which one of Mr. Olsen's colleagues refers to as ''Ken's single-minded passion,'' crystallized after a plunge in 1983 of Digital's earnings and a shake-up of its top management left many wondering whether the company would be trampled under I.B.M.'s feet. **********Mr. Olsen's plan has unfolded piecemeal, as Digital focused virtually all its attentions on rebuilding its VAX line, from the $1 million VAX 8800, which is rivaling some of I.B.M.'s most profitable mainframes, to its remarkably successful MicroVAX II, a year-old $20,000 technical work station that has been embraced on university campuses and in corporate laboratories. **********Indeed, so far, much of Digital's recent success appears to have little to do with networks at all, but with its cycle of new products. The company's biggest customers, computer users who are found more frequently in laboratories and on manufacturing floors than in offices, were thirsting for more computing power, and Digital provided it with its new machines. **********New customers have also been attracted by the fact that all of Digital's VAX offerings run the same operating system, compared with the several different systems used in I.B.M.'s midrange computers, and all connect to the company's reliable, if sometimes slow, Ethernet local area networks. Those two features make it easier to add on to Digital systems in building-block fashion without investing in new software, large corporate users say. Concern About Hassles **********''When you study the accounts where D.E.C. is winning against I.B.M.,'' said Carol E. Muratore, technology analyst for Morgan Stanley, ''you discover that people are really beginning to care about having one operating system and networking that usually works without hassles.'' **********Miss Muratore is among a growing number of computer industry insiders who have embraced Mr. Olsen's vision for Digital. ''If you look back at the 1960's,'' Miss Muratore said, ''I.B.M. gained control of the customer by controlling the mainframe,'' which was the centerpiece of all computing activity. ''Now that mainframes are just one more element of the system, Ken Olsen realizes that in the next decade, whoever controls the network will also control the customer,'' she added. **********But I.B.M. recognizes that, too, but more in theory than in practice so far. Its executives increasingly talk in the same terms as Mr. Olsen, though their language is usually less colorful. And while I.B.M.'s networking products are still in considerable disarray, the giant computer maker has greatly improved its communications technology in the last year, while consolidating midsized computer offerings. **********As I.B.M. makes headway, Digital may need to look for yet another edge. **********''D.E.C. is still suffering the fact that it is heavily oriented toward the scientific and engineering environment, and not toward mainstream office computing,'' said Frank Gens, who follows the company's products for the International Data Corporation, a consulting group based in Framingham, Mass. ''When you look at their software offerings in insurance, or in transportation, or in sales and marketing, you don't find many applications that run on the VAX's. That's going to hurt.'' Greater Competitiveness **********In recent years, however, Digital has bolstered its competitiveness in many ways, slashing its manufacturing staff and lifting productivity and profit margins. The size of the manufacturing staff, for example, has fallen by more than 5,000, to about 27,000, through reassignments and attrition. And revenues from hardware sales, per manufacturing employee, have risen from $125,000 in 1984 to about $200,000 in the fiscal year that ended in June, Still in some disarray, however, is the company's marketing staff, which customers say has never matched I.B.M.'s in professionalism or persistence. That may prove a large impediment as Digital unrolls its networking strategy: Inherently complex, those networks are usually sold only after convincing sales pitches, backed up with presentations by company engineers. But Mr. Olsen has always eschewed glitzy marketing, saying it mostly involved ''selling people things they don't need.'' **********''When marketing is what wins, we are always behind,'' he said. ''But when product is what the customer buys, that's when we do wonderfully.'' **********It was that attitude, critics say, that doomed the Rainbow, Digital's late entry in the personal computer race, which died along with a host of other non-I.B.M. compatibles. The VAXmate, the new personal computer to be introduced Thursday, will be sold primarily as part of larger VAX systems, rather than as a stand-alone machine in a retail store. At $4,045 for a basic VAXmate system, it is an expensive version of I.B.M.'s basic PC AT, though it is already rigged for connection to a local area network. **********For Digital users, the most important advance lies in the accompanying software, which goes a long way toward breaking down the barriers between I.B.M.'s and Digital's incompatible operating systems. In the past, it was difficult - if not impossible - to use an I.B.M. PC to call up data stored in a VAX. With the new program, that can be accomplished easily; in fact, the user may not know if the data she is using was stored in the I.B.M. or in the Digital computer. **********But Mr. Olsen, who is known for rambling through D.E.C.'s offices, trading ideas and acerbic reviews of Digital's own hardware with designers and production personnel of all levels, says he is not satisfied with small victories. **********''Getting people adjusted to the idea of building open computer networks, networks that everyone has access to, is strange, and a lot of people frankly don't like the whole idea,'' said Mr. Olsen, who prefers to sell equipment he thinks computer users need rather than the equipment they want. ''We're going to change them.''  DIGITAL'S EARNINGS RISE ...

With an earnings upturn in sight, why are stocks in this traditionally cyclical industry coming under renewed pressure? **********Last Friday, the Aluminum Company of America and Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical traded at 52-week lows, while Alcan Aluminium the big, Canadian-based producer, sold only slightly above its 52-week low. And shares of Reynolds Metals are down substantially from this year's high of 52 3/4 in March. **********''For aluminum stocks to outperform the market, you need a significant increase in the price of the metal, and I don't expect to see that happen,'' said Peter Ingersoll Jr. of Salomon Brothers. **********Accordingly, he carries the equivalent of a sell recommendation on all four companies. He turned negative on industry prospects in early November. Before that time, his top choice had been Alcan. ''Aluminum stocks are very sensitive to price increases,'' agreed William G. Siedenburg, who follows nonferrous metal companies for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''After reviewing the latest developments, I lowered my earnings estimates about a week ago.'' **********More to the point, the analyst also reduced his investment opinion on Alcan, Alcoa and Reynolds to ''neutral'' from a ''buy.'' He rates shares of Kaiser, which last paid a 15-cent quarterly dividend in February 1985, as a ''hold.'' **********''There had been the general feeling that 1987 would be the year of an upturn for aluminum producers, thanks to the prospect of inventories coming down and demand in the United States rising on the order of 2 to 2.5 percent,'' Mr. Siedenburg said. **********He has maintained his earnings projections for the current year. The estimate for Alcoa, for example, remains at $1.60 a share and that for Reynolds at $3.45 a share. But estimates for 1987 have been reduced - to $3.70, from $4.50, in the case of Alcoa, and to $4, from $6.15, for Reynolds. **********''Formerly, my earnings estimates for next year had been based on one critical assumption -namely, that prices received for the range of aluminum products would be up between 6 and 7 cents a pound,'' Mr. Siedenburg said. ''That would translate into an average price increase of 5 or 6 percent in 1987.'' **********''By early December, however, I heard rumors that the listed price of can stock would be reduced by 6 to 7 cents a pound at the start of next year, which would be a shocking development,'' he added. ''If that occurs, I am concerned that it could expand into some other products, with the result that the average price increase for next year would be cut approximately in half - to around 3.5 cents a pound.'' **********Alcoa is the industry's acknowledged price leader in can stock - a product that winds up mainly as cans for beer and soft drinks. Can stock, moreover, accounts for an estimated 40 percent of Alcoa's total shipments. **********Late Friday, Charles A. Bradford of Merrill Lynch lowered his 1986 earnings estimate for Alcoa, the leading domestic aluminum producer, to between $1.80 and $2 a share - down from $2 previously. He estimates Alcoa will show earnings of $3.50 a share next year. For Alcan, Mr. Bradford projects operating earnings at $2 a share this year and $3.50 next year. **********Over the coming year, he rates both issues as ''above average.'' **********The Merrill Lynch analyst stressed, however, that all of his earnings estimates for aluminum companies next year ''assume an average price increase of 5 cents a pound for 1987.'' **********Mr. Bradford rates Reynolds as ''neutral'' over the next 12 months and estimates company earnings at between $4 and $5 a share in 1987. He carries a ''below average'' opinion on Kaiser - a company for which he projects next year's profits at between 50 cents and 75 cents a share. **********While analysts agree that any lower-than-expected price increases will dampen prospects for aluminum companies, Mr. Ingersoll of Salomon Brothers points to another potentially damaging development. ''Since June of this year, so-called tolling arrangements signal a significant negative structural change for the industry,'' he said. ''Under these arrangements, a third party gets a contract for a lot of alumina - the raw material for aluminum - and brings it to a smelter that is paid a toll, or fee, to process the alumina into ingot. The net effect is to hurt prices by creating an excess of the primary metal.'' **********In some cases, these smelters are owned by smaller companies or else have been reopened in communities in an effort to create employment.

Augusto Pinochet, ''but they want, above all, to avoid a split within the institution. **********''So they want to try to convince Pinochet to make his own decision to step aside,'' he said. ''The problem is that no one in the army is capable of saying that to Pinochet.'' #1989 Vote for Single Candidate As now contemplated under the 1980 Constitution, the voting scheduled for January or early February 1989 would approve or reject a single candidate proposed by the four military commanders. That candidate could be General Pinochet, who is commander in chief of the army as well as President. He would serve an eight-year term and step aside in 1997 for a freely elected president. A congress would be freely elected in 1990. **********Moving up the competitive elections would first require revising the Constitution, which was written by Pinochet supporters. Many changes proposed would have to be submitted to a plebiscite, a process that would take at least a year, according to experts on Chile's constitutional and legal traditions. **********Political opponents take the position that 1989 is too long to wait for a democratic transition. But General Pinochet has rebuffed demands for talks on the issue and has thus far emerged unshaken from recurrent demonstrations, work stoppages and a surge of violence by a small leftist guerrilla force over the last three years. **********The United States, despite the Reagan Administration's recent shift to public criticism of the Pinochet Government, has indicated that it accepts the 1989 schedule as the earliest time a change will be possible, barring unexpected events, according to Administration officials. They said it had come to see the military leadership around and immediately below General Pinochet as the key to accomplishing this. Intermediate Steps Urged **********Ambassador Harry G. Barnes Jr. is focusing his efforts on showing United States support for intermediate steps, such as legalizing political parties, reducing human rights abuses and ending restrictions on the press. At the same time, American officials would like to convince the largest opposition front to support a presidential candidate acceptable to the armed forces. **********The final part of the United States policy equation, according to officials in Washington, is based on the hope that Pentagon officials can convince senior Chilean Army generals of the need to persuade General Pinochet to make plans for giving up power. **********Only slight indications of a military willingness to allow open elections in 1989 have come to light. For example, the navy and air force commanders, Adm. Jose Toribio Merino and Gen. Fernando Matthei, have said they are willing to consider revisions in the Constitution, which is taken to mean changes in the 1989 vote plans. Plans to Export Kiwi Fruit **********General Matthei was also thought to be sending a message related to the transition question when he declared recently that he planned to become an exporter of kiwi fruit in 1989. The present Constitution would allow him to command the air force until 1997. **********Those who want a peaceful change hope to appeal to what they regard as the traditions of the Chilean armed forces. The Chilean military's philosophy has been that it should intervene in politics only when constitutional order appears threatened. **********Despite the hundreds of people killed in the aftermath of the 1973 coup and the arbitrary detention, torture and occasional unexplained killings that have occurred since then, most of the Chilean opposition still speaks of the military with some regard. **********''There is no anti-institutional attitude here against the armed forces as happened in Argentina,'' said Gabriel Valdes, a former foreign minister who is president of the Christian Democrats, the largest political party here. Fear of Disorder Seen **********He said the majority of Chileans wanted to avoid ''disorder, inflation and social tension'' such as occurred under the Marxist-dominated Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens from 1970 to 1973, as well as the ''system of repression, torture and exile'' that followed. **********Armando Jaramillo Lyon, who leads the small Republican Party and is serving a six-month term as president of the seven-party Democratic Alliance, said: ''We have to conduct the democratization together with the army. But the army is very frugal about talking.'' **********As politicians and military experts point out, the traditions of the Chilean military make it unlikely that it will succumb easily to pressures from either the political opposition or the United States. **********The army's policy, according to military experts, is one of unquestioning acceptance of a strict, vertical command. This, together with its tradition of not taking sides in political questions, has made it difficult for the army, once in power, to take up the issue of how to withdraw, unless the order comes from General Pinochet. Reshuffled Upper Ranks **********The general recently reshuffled the upper ranks of the army in what was seen as an effort to insure the loyalty of those around him. Lieut. Gen. Cesar Raul Banavides was removed as the army's representative on the junta after unconfirmed reports that he had joined several other army officers in asking General Pinochet to consider stepping aside in 1989. **********Lieut Gen. Julio Canessa Robert, described as a strict Pinochet loyalist, replaced General Banavides. Lieut. Gen. Santiago Sinclair, also considered completely loyal to the President, moved into the more important post of deputy commander in chief. **********Gen. Gustavo Leigh Guzman, a air force commander who was removed from the junta by General Pinochet in 1978 after he publicly criticized the slow pace of democratization, said General Pinochet, who is 70 years old, has gradually retired generals closest to him in age and seniority, those who might be more inclined to demonstrate independence. General Sinclair, he said, is 10 years behind General Pinochet in seniority. **********''That creates a certain docility,'' General Leigh said. Several Envoys Have Failed Washington officials said their decision to look to the Chilean Army to promote change was a result of the failure of a succession of high-level civilian envoys since 1981 - including Jeane J. Kirkpatrick and two assistant secretaries of state - to accomplish anything significant. **********A State Department official who deals with Chile said in a recent interview in Washington that those visitors had come to Chile ''to make their case to Pinochet that we would like to be helpful but that he has to straighten things out and start a serious democratic transition.'' **********''No one believes any longer that going down there and making a rational argument will have any effect,'' the official added. Pleased by General's Visit **********American officials were pleased, however, when the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. John A. Wickham Jr., visited here last November and was warmly received by General Pinochet. **********''He was the first visitor whom Pinochet did not lecture to,'' said a Pentagon official in Washington."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/08/business/briefs-790986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Farm and Home Savings Association, Nevada, Mo., said it had signed a letter of intent with the Bass brothers and other investors to sell about 2.2 million newly issued common shares for $23.88 a share.

Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, goes before Congress today to deliver the central bank's midyear review, he is likely to encounter a tougher grilling than usual on the Fed's forecasts and plans for correcting the economy's perceived weaknesses. **********Anxieties about the economy were heightened yesterday by the Commerce Department's estimate that the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, grew at an annual rate of only 1.1 percent in the April-June quarter, the slowest pace since the end of the 1981-82 recession. **********The Fed's report to Congress is cautiously optimistic about the economic outlook. For 1986, it expects real G.N.P. to rise within a range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. That implies a slight improvement in the second half over the 2.4 percent rate in the new figures for the first half. **********However, the Fed's forecast of 2.5 to 3 percent for 1986 marks a downward revision from its 3 to 3.5 percent growth range, projected six months ago. The Fed has also marked down its inflation forecast for this year to 2.25 to 2.75 percent from its original range of 3 to 4 percent. The just-reported inflation rate in the second quarter, as measured by the G.N.P. deflator, was only 2.1 percent, the lowest rate since the second quarter of 1967. **********For next year, the Fed sees a moderate pickup. It is projecting inflation-adjusted growth of G.N.P. at 3 to 3.5 percent, with inflation moving up slightly, to 3 to 4 percent. And it predicts that the unemployment rate will decline to 6 3/4 percent by the final quarter of 1987, down a bit from its forecast of 7 percent in the last quarter of this year. **********The main issue facing Congress in reacting to the Fed's midyear review is whether it has given too high a value to the risk of inflation relative to the risk of sluggish growth or recession. **********There is bound to be a dispute about the priorities. Robert D. Hormats, vice president for investment banking at Goldman, Sachs & Company and a former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, is one who thinks that combating the risk of economic weakness should be the Fed's top priority. He notes that Senator Bob Dole, the Republican majority leader, has been ''speaking for further cuts in the discount rate.'' **********Mr. Volcker has often argued that the Fed should cut its discount rate in step with other countries, lest it cause a ''free fall'' of the dollar. Two weeks ago, however, it did cut that rate without waiting for the others, and the dollar, while continuing to slide, has not plunged in a free fall. **********Mr. Hormats sees the United States in a ''bit of a Catch-22'' situation: If the United States does not reduce the dollar's exchange rate further now, the prospects of a worsening trade deficit will increase; but if the Fed fails to bring interest rates down, the economy will weaken, driving the dollar further down anyway. **********In Mr. Hormats's view, the right course is to take the risk of cutting interest rates to move the dollar down and stimulate the economy while you can afford the risk of inflation. He sees a greater risk that, if nothing is done, ''we can really lose control of our currency, as Britain did in 1976.'' **********Not all economists think further cuts in the dollar's value provide the answer to the trade deficit, which has played so key a role in slowing economic growth. Jeffrey R. Leeds, managing director of the Chemical Bank of New York, says the bulk of United States trade with Canada and the Pacific Basin, excluding Japan, is ''unaffected by the highly publicized decline in the value of the dollar, since those currencies have tended to remain steady or have lost value relative to the dollar over the past 15 months.'' **********While cutting the dollar's value may not be the entire answer to the trade deficit, most economists consider it crucial to improving the American trade position. The alternative would be for Japan, West Germany and the other industrial countries to spur their economies as a means of increasing markets for American and other exports. **********But the efforts of Mr. Volcker, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and other Administration officials to ''jawbone'' the Europeans and Japanese into adopting more stimulative fiscal and monetary policies appears to be getting nowhere. **********The choice for the United States is whether to risk unilateral action to bring down interest rates and the dollar - or wait for cooperative action by the other industrial countries. **********In his session with Congress today, Mr. Volcker is likely to find himself under pressure to stop waiting and take more action to reduce interest rates, to spur exports and domestic investment as a way out of a slump. It is a situation calling for the fanciest of footwork, at which his skills are legendary. But he is likely to wind up assuring Congress that the Fed will do whatever is necessary to prevent a recession."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/17/world/britain-rules-out-joining-sanctions.html": {"writer_name": "Jo Thomas", "pub_date": "1986-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 629, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITAIN RULES OUT JOINING SANCTIONS", "print_headline": "BRITAIN RULES OUT JOINING SANCTIONS", "body_text": " **********The British Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, told a high-ranking American official today that Britain will continue to urge the European allies to isolate Libya diplomatically and militarily.

Britain wanted to question the three in connection with an attempt to plant explosives on an Israeli jumbo jet at Heathrow Airport last month and other terrorist acts. **********Effect of Tokyo Summit **********In London today, a spokesman for the Foreign Office called the Syrian expulsion order ''quite unjustified and regrettable,'' but said Britain was not contemplating further measures. **********The Foreign Office added that although the agreement on terrorism reached at the Tokyo economic summit meeting last week had played no direct role in London's decision, the move was representative of the harder line taken by the seven major industrialized nations at the Tokyo parley. **********''The summit agreement has nothing to do with the fact that these people were allegedly engaged in planning terrorist activities in Britain, and that is something we would not allow,'' a spokesman said. ''But the speed and determination with which the Government acted in this case does reflect a new mood.'' **********There was no indication Britain had advised the other nations that attended the Tokyo meeting of its action or that it had sought any concerted action to be taken against the Syrians. Spain Protests to Libya **********In Madrid, meanwhile, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Spain had ordered its Ambassador in Tripoli to lodge a protest with the Libyan Government over terror-related activities by its diplomats. **********The Spanish Government expelled the Libyan Consul General on Friday for setting up a meeting between the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and a Spanish Army officer who was purportedly seeking money for a far-right group planning terror attacks in Europe. **********''We have photographs and tapes to prove it,'' the spokesman, Inocencio Arias, said. ''It is an extremely grave matter.'' **********A Syrian Foreign Ministry statement quoted on the Damascus radio said the British Ambassador, William Roger Tomkys, had been summoned to the ministry and told that the three embassy staff members must leave within a week. The Syrians ordered expelled by Britain also were given a week to leave. **********The three British diplomats expelled by Syria were the military attache, Col. David Maitland-Titterton; a First Secretary, David Taylor, and a Vice Consul, Andrew Balfour.  [ The State Department, asked about Britain's expulsion order, said, ''We have nothing to say.'' A senior official noted earlier that Syria remained on an Administration list of countries that support terrorism. ]  The Syrian expulsions have put relations between London and Damascus under renewed strain. After the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Damascus broke off diplomatic relations with Britain for a time. In recent years, however, there has been a steady improvement in relations. Last year the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, visited Damascus, and earlier this year his Syrian counterpart, Farouk al-Sharaa, had talks in London. **********Earlier today, the Syrian Government newspaper Tishrin accused the British Government of complicity in what it called a campaign against the Arabs orchestrated by the United States and Zionism. Calls for Anti-U.S. Strikes **********Another Damascus newspaper, Al Thawra, called for strikes at American interests in the Middle East. ''It is implausible that the United States and its allies should get away with the all-out war they have proclaimed against the Arabs,'' it said, and it accused unnamed Arab governments of indifference toward Washington's policies. **********Last month Arab foreign ministers failed to agree on a venue and agenda for an emergency conference by their heads of state. The meeting was called for by Libya to discuss the American air strikes April 15 against Tripoli and Benghazi. **********Syria is Libya's closest Arab ally, and its concern over lack of collective Arab counteraction derives from what the Damascus press says is a desire to see the Arabs unite against the United States and Israel. **********In a commentary Saturday, the Damascus radio repeated charges that Syria was being set up for an American-backed attack by Israel. The Israeli Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, has denied that his country was planning a military strike against Syria. **********In a Cabinet communique today, Israel said that it would do everything in its power to avoid war and that it had no intention of attacking Syria. **********''Israel will do all it can to prevent war with Syria,'' the communique said, ''but it is incumbent on the countries of the world to do everything in their power to stop international terrorism and Syria's involvement in that terrorism.'' Syrian Calls Reports 'Rubbish' **********Foreign Minister Sharaa has dismissed as ''rubbish'' reports that the Syrian Embassy in East Germany provided the explosives used in bombing a West German-Arab friendship society in West Berlin in March. He spoke in an interview with Der Spiegel, the West German magazine, that was quoted on the Damascus radio. **********Two Arabs held by the West German police have reportedly testified that they obtained explosives from the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin and used them against a West German-Arab friendship society in the Kreuzberg neighborhood of West Berlin. **********In other developments, the Lebanese Government was reported to have expressed concern to members of the European Community for including Lebanon on a list of countries that sponsor terrorism. Beirut's leading daily, An Nahar, said Lebanese ambassadors in Western Europe had made representations to the governments there emphasizing that President Amin Gemayel opposes terrorism and that Lebanon is itself a victim of terror. **********An Nahar carried a summary of what it described as a report by the European Community that has been received by the Lebanese Foreign Ministry. The report cited Iran, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Southern Yemen as sponsors of terrorism, the paper said. Syria, Libya, Iraq and Iran were listed as providing logistical help for groups engaged in international terrorism, according to An Nahar."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/05/business/briefs-465886.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** B.A.T.

Today was the first time they had advanced this far in southeastern Lebanon since the Israelis evacuated the area a year ago. Gun Battles and Artillery Duels **********Meshghara was reportedly calm today in the wake of large-scale gun battles and artillery duels between militiamen of the National Syrian Social Party and Moslem fundamentalists of the pro-Iranian Party of God. **********The police said 8 militiamen and 15 civilians were killed in the exchanges, which were set off after two of the Syrian-backed group's most senior officials in the region were kidnapped and killed. The organization brought in reinforcements to encircle the town and then stormed it behind sustained mortar and rocket barrages. **********The National Syrian Social Party, which advocates the merger of several Arab countries in a 'greater Syria plan,' has Moslem and Christian members. It is closely associated with Damascus. **********The Party of God takes its name from a verse in the Koran promising success to God's partisans. Its Shiite members cooperate with one thousand Iranian 'revolutionary guards' who have been in the Bekaa region since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon four years ago. Connection Between Groups **********News organizations here often speak of a connection between the Party of God and the Islamic Holy War organization, the underground faction that has taken responsibility for holding American and French hostages. **********The press here said the fighting in Meshghara was a confrontation by proxy between the Syrians and Iranians, who have been vying for influence in Lebanon. **********Political commentators said the deployment of Syrian troops meant Damascus had gained the upper hand in the struggle. **********After the evacuation, the Israelis set up a so-called security zone north of their frontier. The area, which runs parallel to the border and is six miles deep, is patrolled by 1,000 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 Lebanese Christian militiamen. **********Syria has expressed open support for the Lebanese guerrillas, whose declared goal is to force the Israelis to withdraw and dismantle the security zone. Efforts to Enforce Cease-Fire **********In another development, four weeks of bitter fighting near three Palestinian districts in southern Beirut died down today as efforts continued to stabilize a cease-fire announced Saturday. **********The clashes around Sabra, Shatila and Burj al Brajneh between Palestinian guerrillas and Shiite combatants of the Amal movement had left more than 100 people dead and about 700 wounded when a truce was reached in Damascus under the supervision of the Syrian Vice President, Abdel Halim Khaddam. **********Officials from both factions worked with Syrian observers in the field to enforce provisions of the cease-fire. They set up joint patrols and tried to remove gunmen from confrontation lines between the Palestinian quarters and the neighboring Shiite neighborhoods. **********Both sides said that ''three operations rooms'' were set up under Syrian control to monitor the cease-fire."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/20/business/finance-new-issues-jersey-issue-put-at-113.5-million.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 52, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jersey Issue Put At $113.5 Million", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Jersey Issue Put At $113.5 Million", "body_text": " **********A $113.5 million issue of New Jersey's triple-A general obligation bonds is being offered through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers. **********The tax-exempt yields range from 4.70 percent in 1988 to 5.60 percent in 1991, 6.40 percent in 1996, 6.60 percent in 2001 and 6.70 percent in 2007."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/business/what-s-new-in-election-software-writing-letters-to-those-who-care.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1986-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 479, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Writing Letters to Those Who Care", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN ELECTION SOFTWARE; Writing Letters to Those Who Care", "body_text": " **********TO a voter, the computer is a machine. To a computer, the voter is a collection of numerical coefficients, calculated through a series of algorithms, revealing a pattern of daily behavior that reflects actions likely to be taken while inside a booth in the first week of November. **********At least, that is what the political software companies would like their clients to believe. **********Their point is that through computers, a campaign can create a data base of the electorate - a list of all registered voters, complete with voting habits, interests, contributions to the campaign or demographic characteristics. Using that data base, campaigns can aim a political message at any group of voters, playing to that group's interests. **********The software that creates and manipulates those data bases can range in cost from $700 to $2,500, depending on the amount of data, the system's speed, and its ability to adapt to individual needs, said Jeffrey T. Browne, associate publisher of Campaigns & Elections. **********Some consultants will run the programs for the campaigns on a per-project basis. ''We have a program that has a little over 28,000 variations in its breakdown of demographic groups,'' said Frank Tobe, a founding partner of Below, Tobe & Associates, a political high-tech firm in California that says it is working for about 350 Democratic campaigns, and expects to gross about $5 million for the year. **********For between $150 and $225 per thousand, Tobe will take letters aimed at specific voter groups, pick out the corresponding names and addresses from its demographic lists, and mail the letters. For example, Tobe has a ''gay algorithm,'' which is used to locate people who are likely to be homosexual, and thus interested in a politician's stance on gay rights. **********New software also is letting campaign managers pick out likely contributors. ''Selecting an invitation list for a fund-raiser is much easier with the computer,'' said Thomas Herrity, political director for Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia. ''You just ask for a list of people who have given $100 when you have a $250 fund-raiser.'' **********By next year, software is expected to do even more. At Campaign Software, begun in 1983 by two roommates from Harvard University, a system consisting of a small mainframe that can run several minicomputers is now being field-tested with a gubernatorial campaign, Mr. Favia said. He claims that the new system can process more information, and enables two offices to communicate without using a modem. **********Aristotle, meanwhile, is experimenting with software that not only spits out data, but suggests ways to use it. ''We're working on an expert system, so-called artificial intelligence,'' Mr. Phillips said.

''He just kissed me goodbye on two cheeks.'' **********Earlier, she described how her lover, riding in a London taxi to the airport, put what appeared to be a square battery in a pocket calculator that he then pushed down deep into her bag, having explained that it was a gift for a friend. **********According to the prosecutor's opening statement, explosives experts discovered that the battery armed a timing device hidden in the calculator, which would have triggered a detonator, setting off three and a quarter pounds of Czechoslovak-made plastic explosives concealed at the bottom of the bag. **********At 1:04 P.M. on April 17, when the bomb was set to explode, El Al Flight 16 was due to be flying over Austria at an altitude of 39,000 feet with 375 people aboard, including 220 who had boarded the plane at Kennedy International Airport in New York, Miss Murphy and 137 others who boarded in London and 17 crew members. 'One of the Most Callous Acts' **********''It was one of the most callous acts of all time,'' the prosecutor, Roy Amlot, declared. **********Mr. Hindawi, a handsome man with dark curly hair flecked with gray, flashed a confident smile from the dock at his lawyers as Miss Murphy, a chambermaid at the Hilton Hotel when he met her, was called to testify. **********Described by the prosecutor as ''a simple single Irish girl,'' the auburn-haired witness was smartly dressed in a stone-colored cotton jacket over a print blouse. Obviously nervous, she looked ahead steadfastly until she had been on the stand for nearly an hour before stealing a long glance at the man she thought she would wed. **********There was a sharpness to that look, but otherwise she kept her feelings in check. Sometimes she chewed her lower lip as she paused to take in the meaning of a question, but it was not until late in the afternoon when she came to the moment at the airport when El Al Israel Airlines security agents called in the police that she broke down. 'There Was Something Wrong' **********''I got a fright,'' she said, sobbing briefly. ''It hit me then there was something wrong.'' **********Mr. Hindawi, who had periodically broken into smiles during her testimony, now stared blankly from the dock. **********Her answers had come slowly and painfully as Mr. Amlot led her step by step through the course of her romance with the Jordanian who was, by her account, out of touch and out of London for most of the year and a half that she knew him. **********In that period, she had twice become pregnant. On the first occasion, she had a miscarriage; the second time, she said, ''he didn't want to know about it,'' once she finally reached him in West Berlin. His Attitude Changed **********According to her testimony, Mr. Hindawi pressed her to have an abortion, promising to take her on a holiday if she did. But when he appeared at her door on April 7, his attitude had been transformed. **********Then, she said, he wanted to marry her. ''He said in Israel, the holy land,'' she replied when asked by the prosecutor where the marriage would take place.

His Jordanian passport showed that he had visited Poland, East Germany, Rumania and Bulgaria as well as Italy and West Germany in 1985. On Feb. 9 in Damascus, he received the official passport in the name of Issam Shaar. Conflicting Accounts **********Questioned six times by the police, Mr. Hindawi gave conflicting accounts of what he believed to have been in the bag. At first, he said he had thought he was smuggling drugs for the Syrians. Later, after acknowledging that he knew it had been a bomb, he asserted that he believed he had disarmed it by switching the calculator from ''off'' to ''on.'' **********In the course of his sessions with the police, Mr. Hindawi was able to name key Syrian intelligence officials and identify their photographs, according to Mr. Amlot, including the head of military intelligence and an air force intelligence officer named Haitham Said who, he said, had shown him the bag in Damascus and taught him how to set the bag."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/25/business/company-news-fiat-makes-bid-for-alfa-romeo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fiat Makes Bid For Alfa Romeo", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Fiat Makes Bid For Alfa Romeo", "body_text": " **********Italy's Fiat group said it had presented a bid for the ailing state-owned car maker Alfa Romeo, a move that could block a takeover attempt by Ford.

Freeman, a Harvard labor economist. ''For years union people were outpacing the nonunion people, and that was causing all sorts of international competitive troubles for the unionized part of the economy.''

Rahn, vice president and chief economist of the United States Chamber of Commerce. **********''The fact that we have low wage settlements does not preclude a major increase in inflation through monetary expansion,'' he added. **********Historically, fringe benefits have gone up faster than wages, but this pattern was reversed in 1985, an indication of the strong pressure on companies to cut costs. **********The index does not directly measure nonwage benefits but it does break down wages and salaries for private industry workers.

Aquino, claiming victory in the Philippine presidential election, announced a program of strikes and boycotts today that she said would be the start of a nonviolent campaign to bring down the Government of President Ferdinand E. Marcos. **********Mr. Marcos, speaking a day after the National Assembly proclaimed him the winner of an election marked by widespread fraud and violence, said he expected his opponent's protests to ''die on the vine.'' **********''I am the President,'' he said. ''They are not going to drive me out, because the people are behind me.'' General Ver Is Replaced **********At a news conference held while Mrs. Aquino was addressing a rally of hundreds of thousands of people, Mr. Marcos also announced he had accepted the resignation of Gen. Fabian C. Ver as Chief of Staff of the armed forces. **********Mr. Marcos said the general, a cousin and close aide whose removal has been urged by the United States, would be replaced by his deputy, Lieut. Gen. Fidel C. Ramos. But he was vague about when General Ramos would take the post, raising questions about the effective date of General Ver's resignation. **********Mrs. Aquino's announcement, which came a day before President Reagan's special envoy, Philip C. Habib, is to meet with her and with Mr. Marcos, was more moderate than many of her supporters had expected. A Seven-Part Program **********She outlined a seven-part program of resistance to Mr. Marcos's Government, a program that she said would grow ''if Goliath refuses to yield.'' **********It includes a one-day nationwide work stoppage and cancellation of classes on the first working day after Mr. Marcos's inauguration, which is to occur in 10 days. Mrs. Aquino also called for a boycott of seven major banks controlled by Marcos friends, a boycott of Government-influenced news outlets, delayed payments of electric and water bills, and a boycott of a department store and a food-and-beverage conglomerate that are associated with the Government. **********Mrs. Aquino also said she would address the nation for 15 minutes each night if she could find a radio station that would let her, and she called on people to ''experiment with nonviolent forms of protest.'' **********Addressing Government workers, police officers and soldiers, she said, ''Do not support a government that is not supported by the people.'' She did not call on them to take drastic action, but said, ''It is not against the law of man or God to disobey unjust orders.'' **********At his news conference, which was shown repeatedly on Government television, Mr. Marcos said, ''We will let them do whatever she wants to do, provided that they do not start violence or prevent the entry of goods into the markets here, or they do not violate any of the laws like blocking traffic and harassing merchants, things like that.'' **********He presented his assertion of victory as an accomplished fact and dismissed Mrs. Aquino's protests as the complaints of a ''poor loser.'' **********''You're beating a dead horse if you are talking about people supporting me or not,'' he said. ''To me, this is over.'' **********Speaking later on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' Mr. Marcos said: ''This is ridiculous. This is foolish. Why should I step down? We have won a mandate. I'm not a dictator. I'm not unwanted.'' Marcos View of Habib Mission **********At his news conference, he said Mr. Reagan ''has been wrongly informed,'' and added, ''I intend to see to it that the correct information reaches him.'' **********He was alluding to a statement on Saturday in which Mr. Reagan said the election had been ''marred by widespread fraud and violence perpetrated largely by the ruling party.'' Earlier Mr. Reagan had suggested that both sides might have been involved in fraud. **********Mr. Marcos said he believed that Mr. Habib had come to Manila because of confusion in the information reaching Mr. Reagan from the Philippines. **********Calling Mr. Habib ''very incisive and very much his own man,'' Mr. Marcos added, ''I think Ambassador Habib will probably bring to Washington, to the President, the best kind of information that he can obtain from both parties.'' **********Mr. Habib made no public statements today and was said to have spent the day with Ambassador Stephen W. Bosworth and other embassy officials. **********With the full powers of government still firmly in the hands of Mr. Marcos, Mrs. Aquino's options are limited. Her advisers said there had been sharp debate within her inner circle over how strong her actions should be, and some of her supporters said they felt her statement today was too mild. 'One Step at a Time' **********An adviser described Mrs. Aquino's approach as ''one step at a time, see how it goes.'' **********Mrs. Aquino can rely on the support of the Roman Catholic Church, which last week condemned Mr. Marcos's victory as fraudulent and endorsed nonviolent action. But her exclusion from possible forums for protest was underscored by the lack of television coverage of her rally today at a park in central Manila. **********Many in the crowd wore yellow, her campaign color, and waved yellow flags and chanted Mrs. Aquino's name. The crowd appeared to be as large as the one at Mrs. Aquino's final pre-election rally, which was estimated variously at half a million to a million. **********Advisers to Mrs. Aquino said she addressed the rally today earlier than planned because of fears of violence by Mr. Marcos's supporters. **********Mrs. Aquino told the crowd: ''Our struggle is not a simple political struggle. It is a struggle against the forces of evil. We should only remember that what we should do should be peaceful and should not be accompanied by violence.'' **********Saying ''we have a long struggle ahead of us,'' Mrs. Aquino told her followers, ''If you are with me and if Goliath refuses to yield, we shall keep dipping into our arsenal of nonviolence and escalate our nonviolent struggle.'' Timing of General's Resignation **********In making his long-awaited announcement of General Ver's resignation, Mr. Marcos did not explain the timing of the move. But it appeared clear that the general had played an essential role during the election, and that his subsequent removal was intended to satisfy an American demand. **********At his news conference, Mr. Marcos announced that ''upon my proclamation as the President-elect, General Ver has submitted his resignation, and I have accepted it.'' **********''In the meantime,'' the President added, ''the acting Chief of Staff will be Lieutenant General Ramos.'' **********But when questioned further at the news conference and in the television interview, he said General Ramos could not become acting Chief of Staff before the resolution of an accusation that he covered up the military's role in the killing of 27 farmers at a human rights rally in September. **********The President also left it unclear how long General Ramos would serve as acting Chief of Staff and whether he or someone else would subsequently become the permanent military chief. **********The President said General Ver might remain a civilian consultant to the military leadership, and he left open the possibility that the general might remain the head of the National Intelligence and Security Authority, the nation's intelligence network. **********Whatever General Ver's future position, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile said after the news conference that the general would be out of the military chain of command and no longer in a position to issue direct military orders. **********Mr. Marcos expressed irritation when asked at the news conference and again in the television interview about General Ver's future role. 'A Little Degrading' **********''I am sadly humiliated because we seem to be just receiving orders from you, including the appointment of the Chief of Staff of our armed forces,'' he said in the interview. ''Isn't it a little degrading? Have you ever done this to another country, dictate to them who the Chief of Staff is?'' **********The United States has pressed for the removal of General Ver since he was indicted on a charge of involvement in the 1983 assassination of Mr. Marcos's chief political rival, Benigno S. Aquino Jr., the husband of Corazon Aquino. **********General Ver has been viewed as a symbol of the corruption and favoritism that are said to have debilitated the Philippine armed forces in the face of a growing Communist insurgency. **********The general took a leave of absence during the trial, and when he was reinstated after his acquittal in December, Mr. Marcos hinted strongly that he would be removed before the presidential election. **********But in the last days of the campaign, General Ver was put in charge of troops assigned to monitor the voting, a high-profile position that indicated the President's reliance on him. **********During the campaign, Mr. Marcos cited divisions in the military between supporters of General Ver and General Ramos as a reason to delay any major personnel move. Today he said General Ver ''has probably been able to accomplish'' an end to military factionalism. Cites Future of U.S. Bases **********In his television interview, Mr. Marcos renewed a veiled threat to reconsider the presence of American military bases here if Washington cuts aid on the grounds that the election was manipulated. **********''If that happens, we'll have to talk about renegotiating the bases,'' he said. ''The military balance is more important than what we are quarreling about right now - fraud, violence and the like.'' **********An aid cutoff ''may mean that you don't want us as allies any more,'' Mr. Marcos said. ''It may mean you don't want the bases here anymore.'' **********The President denied a report that he had been secretly sworn in late Saturday night, after the National Assembly proclaimed him the winner, and had not waited for a public inauguration 10 days after the proclamation. **********In the television interview Mr. Marcos also said he was personally threatened by Communist forces, indicating that he might use such a threat as a pretext for a future crackdown. **********''I'm still afraid for my life, up to now,'' he said. ''There is an active assassination plot and I think it's going to be executed, or they will try to implement it, by the New People's Army.''

Daniloff, an American reporter who Washington says has been charged with espionage in Moscow as a retaliation. **********''I am convinced a provocation was organized by the secret services of the United States,'' Mr. Zakharov said in Russian through an interpreter at a news conference.

Zakharov Denies Payment **********Mr. Zakharov denied that he was paying John $1,000 for three secret documents when he was arrested on a Queens subway platform, as the F.B.I. has charged. He called the story of the payment ''a pure invention.'' **********But he said, without explanation, that he had been carrying a large amount of money at the time of his arrest. **********He also said that he had met regularly with John, and paid him. **********''I compensated his expenses from my personal funds, I mean, his personal expenditures involving selection and copying of open literature,'' he said. **********Mr. Zakharov said that he had been under F.B.I. surveillance before his arrest, that his telephones were tapped and that F.B.I. agents entered his apartment ''without my permission.'' **********In response to Mr. Zakharov's statements, William M. Baker, assistant director of the F.B.I., said: **********''The affidavit that we submitted in support of the arrest and search of Mr. Zakharov and the subsequent true-bill indictment returned by the Federal Government both met the requirements of probable cause. The F.B.I. will not add credibility to today's assertions by Mr. Zakharov and has no further comment.'' Published Work in Physics **********Mr. Zakharov, dressed in a gray pinstriped suit, appeared relaxed as he sat at an oval mahogany table in the main reception room of the Soviet Mission. **********Flanked by three Soviet officials and an interpreter. he read a prepared statement and then answered questions. He occasionally conferred with Yevgeny Khutovoi, a mission member. **********Presenting himself as an international civil servant with advanced degrees and publications in physics, Mr. Zakharov said his duties at the United Nations Center for Science and Technology, where he has worked since 1982, were to collect and appraise information on scientific developments for use by developing countries. **********To this end, he said, he visited libraries and universities and it was during a visit to Queens College that a notice on the bulletin board caught his eye. **********''One of the students offered his services for retrieval of scientific and technological literature on a temporary basis and for a moderate fee,'' he said. ''That was how I met John.'' Identified by F.B.I. as a Guyanese The F.B.I. has identified Mr. Zakharov's contact as a permanent resident alien from Guyana who is in his mid-20's. Mr. Zakharov encouraged John to apply for a job with a high technology department after he graduated from college, according to the F.B.I. **********Mr. Zakharov said John was critical of American policies and the racial prejudice of white Americans. **********''I was not hiding my contact with John,'' Mr. Zakharov said. ''I believe that F.B.I. officers did approach John, and bearing in mind his plight in this country and his desire to obtain U.S. citizenship, brought heavy-handed pressure upon him with a view to using our relations to organize a provocation.'' **********Mr. Zakharov said John had no access to secret information.''It was a complete surprise to me when John gave me a package which was alleged to contain secret documents,'' Mr. Zakharov said. ''I did not see the documents, nor am I aware of the contents.'' Three Handcuffs Were Used **********As soon as John gave him the package, Mr. Zakharov said, ''I was seized by persons unknown to me who used physical force to push me to the ground and put three handcuffs on me.'' **********''I thought at the time that these were terrorists,'' he continued, ''because, as you know, many Soviet citizens who reside here in New York constantly receive threats by telephone or by letters about the intentions of various organizations that exist in the United States either to kidnap or kill some Soviet diplomats of United Nations Soviet employees.

Armacost was BankAmerica's nice guy, a likable fellow who posed a sharp contrast to A. W. Clausen, his aloof, austere and autocratic predecessor. By most accounts, however, Mr. Armacost's niceness might have been a major reason behind his downfall and the persistent decline in the company's fortunes during his five-and-a-half-year reign. **********That decline culminated yesterday with the announcement that Mr. Armacost - still only 47 years old -would resign this weekend as the bank's president and chief executive officer. It is expected that the 63-year-old Mr. Clausen, who stepped down as president of the World Bank last June, will replace Mr. Armacost, his protege. **********During Mr. Armacost's tenure, BankAmerica moved from one of the country's most profitable bank holding companies to a deeply troubled institution. It reported a $640 million loss in the second quarter of 1986, and deficits of $338 million and $178 million, respectively, in last year's second and fourth quarters. And all the time, since he assumed power, Mr. Armacost kept promising that earnings would improve. **********In April 1981, when Mr. Armacost took charge of BankAmerica - now the nation's second-biggest bank holding company, after Citicorp, but then the leader - he was seen as a ''boy wonder'' who would lead the industry into the new era of deregulation. **********''He had fresh ideas and modern views of what had to be done,'' a former officer said. But part of what had to be done was a streamlining of BankAmerica's vast branch network, which meant huge layoffs and the closing of hundreds of offices. Mr. Armacost was slow to act, even as some of his main competitors were moving more rapidly to trim their operations. **********But Mr. Armacost moved more quickly inside the bank, creating a more open management structure. Unlike Mr. Clausen, Mr. Armacost invited dissent among his advisers and delegated a great deal of responsibility. Some insiders believe that this helped lead to his downfall. **********Under Mr. Clausen's one-man rule, the bank had been relatively free of politics - everyone knew who was the boss and there was little jockeying for power. That broke down under Mr. Armacost's more open rule and perhaps because he did not yet command Mr. Clausen's level of respect. Fiefdoms emerged and politics ensnared the huge organization. **********Some BankAmerica officials say a Byzantine-like atmosphere was fostered by Mr. Armacost's attempt to transform the organization, splitting the bank between the new and the old. ''Anything from the old regime became suspect,'' one official said. **********Partly as a result of that, it became increasingly difficult for Mr. Armacost to glean information that he needed to run the vast organization. **********Pressure for his departure came not only because of a series of huge loan losses but also because the markets had not been prepared for the shocks. For example, only days before big losses were announced, the bank indicated to analysts that BankAmerica would about break even for a quarter. At the same time, BankAmerica's provisions for loan losses were soaring. **********Many analysts still see Mr. Armacost more as a victim than the cause of BankAmerica's misfortunes. They attribute the company's problems to Mr. Clausen and to the change from an inflationary to a deflationary envirnoment. But Mr. Armacost appeared unable to deal satisfactorily with the problems. **********''Sam came into a tough environment,'' said Ronald I. Mandle, a bank stock analyst for Paine Webber. ''He did a number of right things but was overtaken by events.'' **********At first, Mr. Armacost did break some new ground. For one thing, he opened up the discount-brokerage field to commercial banking with the acquisition of Charles Schwab & Company, the discount brokerage firm. Until then, it had been widely believed that banks were not legally permitted to engage in that business. Following regulatory and legal battles, the acquisition was allowed, and most of the nation's other large banking companies followed Mr. Armacost's lead. **********Eventually he also whittled the high-overhead branch system and the staff - there are now 895 branches, down from 1,107 when Mr. Armacost took charge, and there are 76,000 employees, down from 84,000. **********Mr. Armacost grew up in Redlands, Calif., joining the bank as a credit trainee upon his college graduation in 1961. He left to obtain a master's degree in business administration from Stanford Unversity and returned to the bank in 1964. Among his numerous positions were three stints in London. **********Peter Armacost, Sam's brother, said in an interview yeterday that he thought Sam had offered to resign several times but that, until now, the board had not accepted the offer. He said that his brother was ''disappointed'' at the turn of events. **********''He still believes in himself and believes he was doing the right thing,'' Peter Armacost said. ''If he was just given enough time, there would be fulfillment of that strategy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/02/business/japan-jobless-at-a-record.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Jobless At a Record", "print_headline": "Japan Jobless At a Record", "body_text": " **********Japan's jobless rate rose to 2.9 percent in April, matching the highest level since record-keeping began in January 1953, the Government reported Friday. **********The unemployment rate, up two-tenths of 1 percent from March, hit the same record-high level last December.

Kingrey, president of ARA Services' Business Dining Division. ''Lately, it's become a craze.'' Indeed, corporate dining facilities are picking up on the same trends that have swept through expensive restaurants. A recent study by the National Restaurant Association indicates that decaffeinated coffee, fresh fruit and main-dish salads are among the fastest-growing items in restaurants. **********Salads make up about 20 percent of ARA's sales these days, too. Its corporate menus are lavishly sprinkled with low-fat items. And many of the menus now list calorie counts and fat contents. **********ARA's emphasis on healthier eating is not isolated. At the nationwide dining facilities of Motorola, one of the minority of companies that runs its own food services, a precipitous drop in sales of red meat has been accompanied by a 30 percent rise in the consumption of chicken and vegetable dishes. According to food service director Richard Yismael, fish, once a moribund lunch item, has made a dramatic comeback, with broiled filets served in many dining rooms several times a week. **********Food managers say that the trend toward lighter fare has been even more pronounced in dining rooms reserved exclusively for executives. This is in line with the restaurant association's research, which shows that people with high incomes are more interested in diet and light foods. **********''There used to be a lot of filet mignon in the board room, but you virtually never see it now,'' said Rona Moulu, executive chef at CM&M Group, a Wall Street investment firm. ''Especially on Wall Street, people are concerned about heart attacks.'' **********They are also concerned about productivity. ''Heavy cream sauces and big chunks of meat may make you go to sleep after lunch,'' said Richard C. Bachman, president of Epoch Food Service, which feeds many companies in California's Silicon Valley. ''A lot of companies woke up to the fact that after 2:30 their executives were focusing on digestion, not business.'' **********But part of the benefits of lighter eating are being wiped out by what some call the ''punishment-reward syndrome.'' For example, Miss Moulu points out that many of her diners will be ''good'' by eating a piece of plain grilled swordfish or a vegetable terrine for the main course. ''Then it's time for dessert and they go crazy,'' she said. **********Moreover, at breakfast - which more and more people are eating in the company dining room - they throw caution to the winds, she adds.

Mr. Shamir is to become Prime Minister again in October, according to his power-sharing agreement with Prime Minister Shimon Peres. **********The Cabinet debate on the affair today was inconclusive, and Mr. Peres decided not to call for a vote on an inquiry at this time. A majority of Labor ministers support such an investigation, which would focus almost entirely on Mr. Shamir, who was Prime Minister when the bus hijacking and killings took place. Likud and religious party ministers oppose an investigation. Immunity Granted to 4 **********Immunity in the killings has been given to four members of Shin Beth, including the head of the agency, Avraham Shalom, who resigned. Investigators have accused the ex-chief of ordering the killings of the two captured bus hijackers, then covering up the affair with the help of his deputies. The Palestinians who died were cousins, Majdi and Subhi Abu-Jumas. **********Mr. Peres apparently hopes that by deferring the inquiry vote for several days or more, he can give time for public pressure to build in support of the Labor position and thereby influence the religious parties - which hold the balance between the Labor and Likud supporters in the Cabinet. **********''The facts speak for themselves,'' Mr. Gur said in radio interview about Mr. Shamir. ''The person who was responsible for all of this from the start has to get up and say: 'All of the people connected with this have received judgment, and have been taken care of, and I, who stood at the head of the whole system, am leaving.' '' **********Mr. Shamir was quoted by Cabinet sources as saying today at the meeting, ''My conscience is clear.'' **********Officials close to Mr. Shamir repeated the Likud view that the Labor Party ''is ready to sacrifice the security of the state in order to satisfy its narrow political interests and escape from the rotation agreement.'' Parliament and Court Roles **********The full Parliament will debate the matter on Monday. At the same time, Israel's Supreme Court will meet to consider four different legal requests by lawyers and citizens groups for the court to overturn President Chaim Herzog's decision to give Mr. Shalom and three of his deputies immunity in return for Mr. Shalom's resignation. The Labor Party's ability to force an investigation will depend in large part on whether or not the court strikes down Mr. Shalom's resignation-forimmunity arrangement. **********Mr. Shalom has been quoted by two Cabinet ministers as saying that everything he did in the affair was done with the knowledge of the political echelon, meaning Mr. Shamir, then Prime Minister."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/business/investing-gambling-on-options-with-ira-money.html": {"writer_name": "John Boland", "pub_date": "1986-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1227, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GAMBLING ON OPTIONS WITH I.R.A. MONEY", "print_headline": "INVESTING; GAMBLING ON OPTIONS WITH I.R.A. MONEY", "body_text": " **********BROKERAGE firms have begun expanding the risks investors take in their individual retirement accounts. Last weekend, Brown & Company, a Boston-based discount affiliate of Chemical Bank, introduced a national advertisement inviting I.R.A. customers to ''go 'long' options'' - that is, to buy the volatile instruments outright for speculation on the stock market. The practice, while controversial and not yet widespread, has been quietly permitted in I.R.A.'s by a number of other brokerage houses, usually for large customers, and competitive pressure to attract more I.R.A. money seems destined to prompt more firms to relax restrictions. **********''We try to keep it to a minimum,'' said an executive at Robert W. Baird & Company, a regional firm based in Milwaukee. The Baird employee, who asked not to be named, estimated that the firm's management had cleared less than 1 percent of the firm's I.R.A. accounts to trade options. ''We just don't like it,'' he said. **********Brokers may face legal perils in accepting such business, because there is an active debate over whether high-risk instruments are suitable for retirement accounts. If a small investor decimated his or her I.R.A. by playing the options market, the prudence of the account's custodian - usually a bank or a broker - might be called into question. Thus brokerages are usually loosening restrictions only for higher net-worth customers, who presumably are more sophisticated. So, while Brown & Company has opened the options' door to anyone with a $25,000 net worth, its president, George A. Brown, said: ''We want to see more if we can. And we want to see some experience in option trading.'' **********The Internal Revenue Service, which oversees retirement plan laws, has no guidelines prohibiting I.R.A.'s from trading in options or, for that matter, in futures contracts, which could cover anything from stock indexes to heating oil to currencies. The only forbidden investments, broadly speaking, are collectibles such as precious metals, personal residences and businesses (under the heading of self-dealing), and investments that involve borrowed money, such as leveraged real estate, margined stock or short sales. The I.R.S. is studying whether it should ban the use of futures contracts or options on collectibles. ''We don't have a firm opinion on whether buying futures is the same as buying the collectibles,'' an I.R.S. spokesman said. **********Since last year, Merrill Lynch & Company, which has 1.3 million I.R.A.'s controlling $15 billion in assets, has offered managed futures trading partnerships to its larger I.R.A. customers. The account must total at least $50,000 (such a large I.R.A. could be the result of a rollover) and no more than 10 percent of assets may be used in the volatile futures game. E. F. Hutton and Thomson McKinnon Securities offer similar limited partnerships. A spokesman for Rudolf Wolff Commodity Brokers Inc. said the firm had ''just a handful'' of self-directed I.R.A. accounts trading futures directly. **********The prospect of options and futures catching on in I.R.A.'s worries some onlookers. ''In an I.R.A. account you should take a conservative attitude, slow and easy,'' said Patrick Miller, office manager for Thomson McKinnon in Baltimore. ''If you speculate in the account, you'll get an occasional home run. But you'll get a lot of strikeouts, too.'' **********Not every options strategy is fraught with danger. Most brokerage firms have routinely permitted investors to write calls against stock held in an I.R.A., a tactic that can generate income and limit downside risk. Though it does not promote the practice, Merrill Lynch also allows purchases of puts to hedge specific stock holdings against a price decline. So far it has held the line against allowing I.R.A. customers to buy call options, which are a bet on higher stock prices. ''We are looking at whether we should expand this,'' said Donald Underwood, head of Merrill's retirement plans. **********Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., in Philadelphia, which has ''maybe a few hundred'' accounts of more than $10,000 cleared for options trading, requires that customers sign an additional release stating that ''they realize it's very speculative and that it might not be a good idea,'' according to Gail Simon, vice president and head of retirement plans. **********Interviews with brokers and lawyers at a dozen concerns found wide agreement that competitive pressure is a major factor. ''We would love to say 'No, you cannot do options in an I.R.A.,' '' said the executive at Baird. ''A year ago, we did. But due to market competition we've relaxed that and permit long options on a case-by-case basis.'' **********While a broker who restricts trading risks losing accounts, the cost to investors plunging into options can be catastrophic, according to many analysts. The arguments against high-risk instruments in tax-deferred accounts can be summed up this way: the chance of loss is high, the losses in an I.R.A. cannot be written off against income, and money lost cannot be replaced by additional contributions. **********''Long options are extremely speculative,'' said John Bradburn, sales manager for Merrill Lynch in Baltimore. ''They have no intrinsic worth.'' To use them in a retirement account, he added, would be ''from a fiduciary perspective, very irresponsible.'' **********The Baird executive noted: ''Less than 5 percent of long option buyers consistenty have capital gains. It just doesn't happen. So if the options are 20 to 1 against you, why put it in a tax-deferred account where there's no way to write off a loss against your income?'' **********Even hedging with puts, to protect against a price decline, makes little sense, argue some analysts. In an I.R.A., there is no tax reason not to take a profit by selling stock, if an investor fears a slump. GETTING OUT OF MUNSINGWEAR **********Munsingwear Inc.'s controlling investors have apparently decided that it is time to cash out. The Minneapolis-based maker of underwear and sports clothing filed registration papers for a 1.25 million-share secondary public stock sale last week with the help of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. At least 928,000 shares will be sold by the Texas-based Bass Brothers group. **********At first glance, the timing looks opportune for investors to jump into Munsingwear: Reported earnings have been staging a rebound, on higher sales. But a review of the initial prospectus would reveal that most earnings are from one-time benefits. **********The Bass Brothers, who own 45 percent of Munsingwear's common, could sell all but 5 percent of their stock back to the public, if the maximum shares are sold. The Bass Brothers' cost is well below the stock's recent $20.63 high (the 52-week low is $8.87; last week the stock was around $18). Munsingwear's management holds less than 1 percent of the common. **********In 1985, Munsingwear's revenue, lifted in part by an acquisition, climbed 23 percent, to $114.2 million. Final earnings per share were $1.12, seemingly quite a comeback after big losses in 1979-82. **********Yet extraordinary items contributed most of the net: The sale of several plants, a sale of lease rights, tax loss carry forwards. **********Actual profits from selling apparel in 1985 were a paltry $60,000 before taxes - a couple of cents a share. The stock has been trading at a premium to an $11 book value. That may explain why smart professional investors such as the Bass Brothers have decided the time is ripe to shed Munsingwear."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/business/what-s-new-in-corporate-cost-cutting-curbing-an-executive-s-travel-rights.html": {"writer_name": "Scott Bronstein", "pub_date": "1986-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 533, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Curbing an Executive's Travel Rights", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN CORPORATE COST-CUTTING; Curbing an Executive's Travel Rights", "body_text": " **********THE Stroh Brewery Company has always told its employees to ''travel efficiently.'' But, even though better than 1,000 of Stroh's 5,000 or so employees travel regularly on business, until recently Stroh's never spelled out for them what ''efficient travel'' meant. The result was that ''most pick the carrier and hotels that accommodate their frequent flyer packages,'' said Ronald K. Cupp, manager of corporate personnel. **********Now Stroh's, tired of paying an annual tab of close to $8 million for flights, hotels, meals and other travel costs, is getting more explicit. It is insisting that all of its employees book their trips through the same company-selected travel agent, and that the agent choose the most efficient method of getting from one point to another. **********Stroh's expects to benefit from preferred rates from frequently used air carriers and hotels. ''Say a traveler goes to a city, and is used to staying at a hotel that charges $115 per night,'' said Mr. Cupp. ''Now we'll have a hotel in our preferred-rate plan in that city, which charges much less. If employees elect not to stay in the preferred hotel, we'll only reimburse the preferred rate. The rest will come out of their pockets.'' **********Stroh's is no isolated case. Consultants say that many companies are centralizing travel planning these days, and clamping down on individual expense accounts. ''Today, companies that want to be efficient must wrest the decision away from individuals, and turn travel into a corporate policy,'' said Mr. Burris of Runzheimer. **********The stakes are high. Large companies are expected to spend an average of $2.35 million each on employee travel this year, according to a Runzheimer survey of travel managers. That will be up from last year's average of $2.23 million, and, companies project, below next year's total. **********As Stroh's numbers show, some companies spend many times that amount already. Mr. Shultheis of Mastercard, which recently started offering a corporate charge card called Businesscard, says that travel and entertainment is the third-largest staff expense category, after salaries and data processing. **********According to the Runzheimer survey, air fares are the most significant travel cost, accounting for nearly half of corporate travel tabs. About one-quarter of the travel costs are for lodging. Just under 15 percent goes for meals, and 10 percent for rental cars. The remaining dollars are spent on miscellaneous items such as taxis, limousine services and gratuities. **********But while employee travel itself will always be on the cost side of the ledger, a few companies have found ways to make their centralized travel operations pay for themselves. **********For the past year, Johnson Wax has contracted with Heritage Travel of Cambridge, Mass., to operate its corporate travel center. The agency makes all of the company's travel arrangements, including reservations for airlines, hotels, and rental cars. In return for its lock on the business, the Heritage splits its commissions with Johnson Wax. **********According to Mr. Parker of Johnson Wax, commission revenues cover the costs of operating the center and then some. ''We expect the return on this will be in excess of $100,000 annually,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/10/business/peat-marwick-settles-suit-brought-by-fdic.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1986-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 514, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Peat Marwick Settles Suit Brought by F.D.I.C.", "print_headline": "Peat Marwick Settles Suit Brought by F.D.I.C.", "body_text": " **********Peat Marwick, Mitchell & Co., the Big Eight accounting firm, said yesterday that it had settled a $90 million lawsuit brought against it by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after the collapse of the Penn Square Bank. **********Arthur Bowman, the editor of the Public Accounting Report, an Atlanta-based industry newsletter, said the F.D.I.C. ''probably settled for less than half'' of the roughly $90 million it was seeking. **********Neither Victor M. Earle, who is Peat Marwick's principal attorney in the case, nor Charles Baker, the F.D.I.C.'s lawyer, would disclose the size of the settlement. They said they did not want to prejudice coming jury trials relating to Penn Square. **********Penn Square, based in Oklahoma City, collapsed in 1982 after huge loans to energy-company borrowers went bad. Soon after the collapse, Federal regulators said they had uncovered substantial evidence of fraud and criminal violations at the bank. Big Losses at Several Banks **********The failure of the Penn Square produced big losses at the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Michigan National Bank and the Seattle-First National Bank. Penn Square's demise also caused the near collapse of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, which, like the others, purchased loans from Penn Square. **********Peat Marwick audited the 1981 books of Penn Square and issued a clean opinion, which the F.D.I.C. said failed to recognize the bank's deepening financial problems. In its suit, the F.D.I.C. also charged that partners in Peat Marwick's Oklahoma City office had received preferential loan treatment from Penn Square, compromising their independence as auditors. **********Throughout the case, Peat Marwick maintained that it had conscientiously applied accepted auditing standards at Penn Square. It repeated that contention yesterday. ''We have denied all the charges,'' Mr. Earle said. He went on to say that Peat Marwick was fully insured for the settlement and that the firm might not even have to pay the deductible, typically more than $1 million on liability policies. Under the policy, Peat Marwick's deductible was reduced by its legal expenses. Lingering Injury From the Fiasco **********The Penn Square fiasco has hurt Peat Marwick, however. The auditor faces other multimillion-dollar lawsuits arising from the case and, according to Mr. Bowman of the Public Accounting Report, the Penn Square case continues to tarnish Peat Marwick's image among bankers, corporate executives and others who buy accounting services and read audited financial statements. **********''It's amazing to me that Peat Marwick has been unable to shake the black cloud of Penn Square,'' Mr. Bowman said. ''This has done more damage to Peat Marwick than other lawsuits have to other firms.'' **********The case brought by the F.D.I.C against Peat Marwick, while sizable and painful to Peat Marwick's partners, is by no means the largest of its kind. About a year and a half ago, the British Government sued Arthur Andersen, another Big Eight accounting firm, charging that Andersen failed to uncover irregularities in the books of the De Lorean Motor Company, which the Government helped finance.

But ''the move was exaggerated by professional program trading,'' he added. **********Effect of Program Trading **********Professional trading programs occasionally dominate the market when the gap between the price of stock index futures and the price of the shares that underlie the index is unusually wide. **********When interest rates fell yesterday, traders said the index futures rose sharply, even before the overall stock market reacted to the news. The index futures were then selling too high in relation to the stock market, so professional traders started selling the futures and buying stocks in a typical arbitrage move. **********Unlike Friday, most other important indexes joined the Dow's move into uncharted territory. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.16 points, to 123.29, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.18 points, to 213.96.

The 1,500 level was breached Dec. 11, slightly more than a month after the average broke 1,400. **********The stock market's latest rally is nearly two weeks old. It began after the Dow dipped to around 1,500 on fears that lower oil prices would be bad for the nation's banking system. **********But Wall Street now seems to have changed its opinion of reduced oil prices, and even seems more comfortable about the current level of interest rates. **********Mr. Johnson of First Albany said the feeling is that the Treasury's notes and bonds will be in strong demand, especially by Japanese buyers who face lower interest rates at home. Heavy demand could bring down borrowing costs in the United States, even if the Federal Reserve takes no overt action. **********Most traders, however, conceded that lower rates alone would not have been enough to account for the stock market's recent remarkable showing. The institutional buying programs helped, they said. **********Michael Antennucci, first vice president of Paine Webber Inc., estimated that more than $500 million was channeled into the market yesterday from these arbitrage buying programs alone. He said Paine Webber spent about $100 million. But he added that ''if anything, it was fundamentals that started this thing.'' G.M.

Airline issues gained because of a drop in fuel prices. AMR rose 1 7/8, to 48 1/2, and United gained 1 1/8, to 55. **********Gillette rose 4 3/8, to 76. Although takeover rumors have arisen in the past, yesterday's move was probably caused by favorable reports from Prudential-Bache Securities and Dean Witter.

The stock of the company, which also announced a share repurchase plan, gained 8 1/2 on Friday. **********United Technologies gained 2 1/4, to 49 1/8. It plans to repurchase up to 10 million of its own shares. NL Industries rose 7/8, to 15 7/8. Coniston Partners said it owns 8.2 percent of NL stock.

McKinney, chairman and chief executive of the Manville Corporation, decided to file for protection under Chapter 11 of Federal bankruptcy laws to deal with mounting claims filed by victims of asbestos-related disease. **********Nearly four years later, a Federal bankruptcy court has approved Manville's reorganization plan, and the company expects to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings by mid-1987. **********But Manville faces several challenges. It is trying to force the Government to help compensate asbestos victims, maintaining that many who have sued the company were exposed to asbestos in Government-owned or controlled shipyards. **********Manville has pledged more than $2.5 billion to a trust for compensating victims. But the trustees of the ''settlement vehicle'' could possibly wield considerable influence over Manville because the trust will own up to 80 percent of the company. **********Manville is also undergoing a management transition. A new board has just been selected, and Mr. McKinney, 62 years old, plans to retire Sept. 1. His heir apparent, Josh T. Hulce, unexpectedly resigned as president in April. Mr. McKinney recently discussed these challenges. **********Q. Do you expect the trustees to be involved in setting management policy? **********A. If I were a trustee, I would be very reluctant to get involved in any way in the management of the operating company. We're not going to try to run the trust, and the trust is not going to try to run the company. **********Q. There has been some speculation that the attorneys of asbestos victims in the bankruptcy proceedings, including Leon Silverman, forced out Mr. Hulce. Is that true? **********A. In an April meeting with Silverman, I told him my plan was to step down as chief executive on Sept. 1 and to remain as chairman for a time -until the first of the year - because of the relative youth of senior management. **********It was then our plan not to have a chairman but to go back to having the president and chief executive officer preside at board meetings. Silverman objected to the elimination of the job of chairman on the basis that the operating management was relatively inexperienced. He proposed a chairman from the outside. Our board decided it would not accept a non-employee chairman. **********The judge wanted us to compromise, which was that one of our experienced directors, George C. Dillon, who retired early as chairman of the Butler Manufacturing Company, would take the job. Q. Then why did Mr. Hulce quit?  A. There was a lot of acrimonious debate with some people in working out the plan of reorganization. He felt it might hurt his effectiveness in dealing with, for instance, our commercial and trade creditors after confirmation of the plan. **********Q. What is your response to critics who say your $1.3 million severance package and Mr. Hulce's $530,000 arrangement are extravagant ''golden parachutes''? **********A. The use of the word ''golden parachute'' is totally inappropriate. This is a normal program based on Manville's standard separation policy. **********Q. Manville has agreed to create a fund of at least $125 million to settle property-damage claims. How much will those ultimately cost? **********A. Outside of our Chapter 11, there is a lot of litigation going on related to property damage. I don't really know how the property damage thing will play out. My own belief is there really isn't any liability. We've negotiated that $125 million figure. I don't think it will be more than that. **********Q. What are the remaining obstacles to be overcome to emerge from Chapter 11? **********A. There is litigation on behalf of the common shareholders, whose holdings will be diluted by up to 98 percent. The trust will get up to 80 percent of the stock and the commercial and trade creditors and preferred shareholders will also get some common stock. I don't know how big an obstacle that litigation will be. The ultimate risk in bankruptcy falls on common shareholders. I regret very much what happened. **********Q. You are still trying to force the Government, in lawsuits and in Congress, to help compensate asbestos-health victims. What are the chances of Congress passing such legislation? **********A.

Baker 3d was seeking agreement for a coordinated reduction in interest rates among the five countries. **********Mr. Baker declined to comment, but Reuters quoted Mr. Bangemann as saying that the Secretary of the Treasury ''is in favor of everybody lowering interest rates,'' a move that would help less developed countries that are heavily indebted. **********Mr. Bangemann's comments quickly revived speculation in the bond market that the Federal Reserve might ease monetary policy and encourage lower interest rates in order to cooperate with the Treasury Secretary's proposal. Since the economic leaders agreed in September to reduce the value of the dollar, the Federal Reserve has not reduced short-term interest rates, though it actively sold the American currency in foreign exchange markets to help reduce its value by about 20 percent. Predictions of an easier American monetary policy were widespread after the September meeting, but recent signs of strength in the American economy have caused economists to expect that the Fed will hold monetary policy unchanged. **********Treasury Bond Issues **********By late in the day, the new 9 7/8 percent Treasury bonds due in 2015 had gained nearly 1 1/2 points to an offered price of 104 22/32, to yield 9.40 percent, down from 9.55 percent a day earlier. The bellwether Treasury bond issue remains well below the Jan. 7 New York closing price of about 107 7/32, to yield 9.17 percent, but has now gained nearly 2 points in the last two days. **********In the Treasury note market, the Government announced plans to sell $9.5 billion of new two-year notes next Wednesday. The new issue was offered on a when-issued basis late in the day with a yield of 8.23 percent. **********Short-term interest rates also declined, with the three-month Treasury bill falling as low as 7.14 percent, ending the day with a bid rate of 7.2 percent, down from 7.27 percent. In advance of today's auction of new one-year Treasury bills, the outstanding one-year issue was bid at a rate of 7.31 percent. **********Traders of long-term Treasury issues said the volume of trading was light with little institutional buying. They added that the sharp price gains had resulted from purchases by speculators who had started the day with large short positions. **********''The market has two more days to sort out what is happening and a lot of people are staying on the sidelines,'' said one trader who asked not to be identified. Another trader saw the weekend meeting as an example of conflict between ''the Treasury and Baker, who would not mind a little more inflation, and the Federal Reserve, which is not likely to buy that prescription.'' **********Many economists were skeptical that officials from the United States, France, Japan, Britain and West Germany could agree to reduce interest rates, because of disagreement within some countries about the wisdom of lower rates and different economic agendas among the five nations. **********Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at E.F. Hutton & Company, estimated that the Federal Reserve could ease monetary policy and promote lower interest rates, without abandoning its commitment to keep inflation low. ''There are a lot of sick sectors in the world economy, and if you are a walking bankrupt, lower interest rates would be a big relief.'' **********A strong rise in industrial production for December, which economists expect will be announced today, ''is not sufficient reason to avoid easing monetary policy,'' Mr. Barbera said, ''because interest rates are still high, and there is still ample room for growth.'' **********But many other economists estimate that the Federal Reserve is not likely to provide any economic stimulus in the form of lower interest rates so long as the American economy is growing at around 3 1/2 percent or 4 percent after inflation. **********Mieczyslaw Karczmar, chief economist at the European American Bank, agreed that ''high interest rates are creating headaches around the world,'' but doubted that all five industrial countries would agree to lower their rates. Fed Policy Outlook **********''I don't see any great reason for the Fed to ease policy,'' Mr. Karczmar said, adding that Fed officials seem ''scared of what might happen if the dollar were to decline more sharply.'' Although additional weakness in the dollar will be needed to significantly reduce the American trade deficit, Mr. Karczmar said the American policy makers worry that a weaker dollar will bring greater inflation. **********In Britain, Mr. Karczmar noted that a decline in the pound brought on by lower oil prices recently prompted a tightening of monetary policy and higher interest rates. West German officials have been reluctant to accelerate their program of tax cuts, even though they have low inflation, a trade surplus, and high unemployment. **********In Japan ''the economy has become weaker recently, so there is a desire for lower interest rates,'' said Toshihide Mizuno, an economist at the New York branch of Sanwa Bank Ltd. ''But Japan cannot cut its rate alone, because that would result in a weakening of the yen,'' which would exacerbate the trade surplus with the United States and run counter to the September agreement among the industrial countries that the dollar should decline. **********Although the recent health of the American economy argues against a cut in interest rates here, Mr. Mizuno estimated that ''within three months or so the American economy will appear weaker and there will be another time to consider'' reducing interest rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/18/world/thousands-in-lebanon-march-to-back-un-force.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1986-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 665, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THOUSANDS IN LEBANON MARCH TO BACK U.N.

''There is nothing to worry about in such an event,'' he said, adding, ''Not that any one of us would be glad to see such a change, but I don't think we have to see it as a tragedy.'' **********Mr. Lubrani indicated that the South Lebanon Army, trained and financed by the Israelis, might increase operations north of the security zone to stop attacks against its positions.

Businesses and consumers simply are not spending at levels that will stimulate strong growth either in their own countries or in less-developed nations that depend on foreign demand for their goods. **********Production from factories and mines in these three major industrial powers - which together account for almost half of the world's gross national product - has been particularly weak, leaving prospects for the global economy as a whole looking flat. Dampening Expectations **********At a time of growing interdepencence of world economies, the slowdown in the world's three major economies is dampening expectations throughout the rest of the developing and industrial world. As a result, many economists fear that heavily indebted poorer countries, already suffering from a collapse in raw material prices, could be pushed closer to default on their debt, raising renewed fears of an international banking crisis. **********''A sense of anxiety is developing about where we are going,'' said Lord Lever, the British financier who served as economic advisor to the last Labor Government of Sir Harold Wilson. **********''No one foresaw the downturn,'' said Monique Fouet, a senior economist at the Observatoire Francais des Conjunctures Economiques, a French economic forecasting unit. ''This is unsettling, though we still expect an improvement later.'' **********Alan Greenspan, the chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic Advisers, now of Townsend-Greenspan & Company, a New York economic consultant, warned, ''There is a general expectation of recovery in the air for which the supporting evidence doesn't exist.'' Still Better Off **********To be sure, economists are not forecasting severe hard times because the benefits of the sharp drop in energy prices should provide a lift in the second half. And, despite the sluggish growth of the first half, the world's major economies are still better off than during the early years of this decade, following the second shock from higher oil prices in the late 1970's. **********But the boost from lower energy prices has been slow in developing, and a Western economic growth rate of at least 3 percent a year is widely considered necessary to prevent an aggravation of the third world's debt problems and head off a further rise in Western unemployment. Economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris now doubt whether their bellwether prediction that the world will just reach the magic three percent threshold this year can now be realized. **********The first-quarter results, which have been released in recent weeks, and the indicators of growth in the second quarter, confirm that the economies of the world's three big industrial powers have been weak. The United States' total output of goods and services grew by 2.9 percent at an annual rate during the first quarter of this year, below earlier estimates and well under the Administration's 4 percent target. Worse in Japan **********The picture is worse in Japan. During the first three months of the year, the Japanese economy shrunk by 2.1 percent. West Germany is also stalling. Total economic output dropped 5.1 percent in the first quarter of this year from the previous quarter's level, with industrial production 3.8 percent lower. After picking up in April, industrial output dropped again in May. **********The most recent estimate by 44 forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Worldscan in St. Louis shows a revision downward of their average 1986 growth forecast for the United States from 2.5 percent, to 1.6 percent; for Europe from 3.2 percent, to 2.9 percent, and for Japan from 2.8 percent, to 1.7 percent. **********The standard explanation of this year's growth pause is that the adverse impact of the oil price fall is hitting Western economies before the more favorable effects are felt. Exceptional cold weather in Europe also depressed activity in the early months of this year, while the yen's sharp rise unsettled Japan export industries. Cancel Investments **********The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries as well as other oil-producing areas of the Western world, from Norway to Texas, which stand to lose billions of dollars as a result of the oil price slide, are moving quickly to cancel new investments and cut imports from the oil-consuming parts of the globe. Since late last year, the price of a barrel of crude oil has dropped from more than $25, to less than $10. **********On the other hand, consumers and businesses, which find themselves better off as a result of cheaper oil, are being slow to spend their new wealth. Companies are holding back on ordering plastics, chemicals and other products until their price has dropped in line with the declining cost of oil. **********Consumers, who see the purchasing power of their incomes rise as prices fall, are stashing away the gains instead of spending them. Germans, for instance, increased their savings from 12 percent of their income on average, to 14 percent in the first quarter of this year. Fierce Quarrel **********The unexpected first-quarter pause in world growth, and fears it could continue, has touched off a fierce quarrel between competing schools of economic policy makers. **********Some believe Western economies will soon take off again on their own as the initial negative impact of falling oil prices fades, and the beneficial effects make themselves felt. **********Mrs. Fouet said: ''The upturn is delayed. Have patience.'' Of course, much of the additional income gained by the industrial world will merely offset lost demand from the poorer oil-exporting countries. But some oil exporters will draw down reserves and borrow to maintain consumption. **********Meanwhile, the steep fall in inflation brought about by lower oil prices increases spending power everywhere, allows for lower interest rates and has helped bring about a worldwide stock market boom that makes many feel richer. **********The result could be a speed-up in economic growth later this year and in 1987 despite the disappointment of the last few months, many forecasters believe. **********The London Business School believes growth will reach 4.5 percent in the Western world next year, the highest number produced by any well-known forecaster so far. The Blue Chip Economic Worldscan forecast for economic growth in Europe next year has climbed from 2.2 percent, to 3.1 percent since last January, while for the United States it has risen from 2.6 percent, to 3.6 percent. **********Those who believe the world economy will pick up on its own are resisting pressure for lower interest rates or more stimulatory fiscal policies. ''What would a reduction bring us if we are already well on the way to achieving what we see as the economy's maximum growth potential this year of 3.5 percent,'' argued Bundesbank Council member Klaus Kohler, after the German central bank refused to follow last week's United States discount rate cut. One-Time Effect **********Supporting the German and Japanese central banks' point of view, the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, warned in its latest report that inflationary pressures have not really disappeared from Western economies. While the one-time effect of falling oil and raw material prices has stopped inflation in the marketplace, the B.I.S. warned that underlying inflation was still running at 2 percent to 3 percent a year when the effect of falling import prices was excluded. **********Others however, think the slowdown could herald a new recession, reinforcing the case for lower interest rates or fiscal measures to increase demand in West Germany and Japan, as United States Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d urged. They also fear any revival of world economies will be weakened by new depressive forces. David D. Hale of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago fears United States tax revision, far from being revenue neutral, will increase business taxes leading to ''sluggish growth without a big interest rate cut.'' **********Meanwhile, the O.E.C.D is forecasting a slight overall tightening of fiscal policy in the major industrial countries in 1987 as governments continue to reduce budget deficits. **********Finally, the long-awaited turnaround in the United States budget and trade deficits, whenever it comes, must futher reduce the lift the European and Japanese economies are getting from their exports."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/25/world/syria-prods-its-allies-to-move-against-the-plo-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1986-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 742, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SYRIA PRODS ITS ALLIES TO MOVE AGAINST THE P.L.O.

The improvement in the market for ''junk bonds'' was evident by late morning, when Frederick Joseph, chief executive officer at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the leading firm in the field, told employees that the market for these high-yield, low-quality bonds had stabilized with a significant flow of buy orders from institutional investors. **********Other analysts agreed that price declines of about 3 points earlier this week were enough to attract good demand for more than $2 billion of new speculative-grade issues and to support prices of more seasoned bonds. **********The stability of junk bond prices also extended to several taxable municipal bonds that were tainted by concern about the liquidity of junk issues because they were backed by guaranteed investment contracts of Executive Life, a major investor in junk bonds. For example, the 9 percent bonds of Adams County, Colo., due in 1996, which had dropped from 101 to 99 earlier this week, were offered yesterday at par, unchanged on the day.

Mr. Johnson noted that Fed officials had already indicated they would not tighten monetary policy in response to M-1 if M-2 growth behaved. **********He said that various components of M-2, including certain overnight bank borrowings, individuals' money market fund assets and small time deposits, declined in the week ended Nov. 10, suggesting that ''M-2 growth for November may still come in at about 8 percent.'' The Fed has set a 7 to 9 percent growth target for M-2 from August to December. **********Other Fed data showed financial institutions' borrowings at the discount window little changed at $374 million in the two-week reserve accounting period ended Nov. 19. Signs of Fed Policy Seen **********Although the Federal funds rate rose to 6.06 percent in the latest two-week period from 5.94 percent, analysts said the Fed data, as well as recent moves by the central bank to supply reserves to the banking system, were a good sign that the Fed was not trying to tighten monetary policy. **********Excess reserves were unusually high in the latest two-week period, suggesting that the high funds rate was a technical aberration, not a shortage caused by Fed policy. **********In the high-grade sector of the corporate market, securities dealers said new issues were well received, but they did not attribute the strong demand to purchases by investors who normally buy junk bonds. **********Among the larger new issues that were introduced yesterday were a $150 million offering of Anheuser-Busch 8 5/8 percent sinking fund debentures, due in 2016 and priced at 98 1/8 to yield 8.9 percent, through Dillon, Read & Company. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)           Average Price   94.489        Discounted Rate   5.45%        Coupon Yield   5.77%        Low Price   94.479        Discounted rate   5.46%        Coupon Yield   5.78%        High Price   94.500        Discounted Rate   5.44%        Coupon Yield   5.75%        Accepted at low price   84%        Total applied for   $27,527,435        Accepted   $9,779,835        N.Y. applied for   $23,373,450        N.Y. accepted   $8,666,650        Noncompetitive   $203,435       The one-year bills mature Nov. 27, 1987."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/01/business/request-on-sanctions.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Request on Sanctions", "print_headline": "Request on Sanctions", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration confirmed today that it was considering requests by American oil companies to sell or transfer their assets and their equity in Libya's oil production rather than have the assets and oil be given to the Libyan Government and Col.

In fact, some said the military had been remarkably helpful to journalists wishing to see warships involved in the manuevers. **********The Navy has barred reporters from getting near the fighting in territorial waters claimed by Libya, but several large news organizations said they understood the reasoning behind the military's decision. There has been unusual harmony between the press and the Pentagon, they said. **********''We're not in love with the military, but on the other hand we understand their priorities,'' said Robert J. Murphy, vice president for television news coverage at ABC. ''Although they are not providing us with everything we want to be provided with, they have been as open and as cooperative as we can reasonably expect.'' **********His views were largely echoed by representatives of The Washington Post, NBC News and CBS News. Two large groups representing reporters and editors said they had received no complaints about the military's treatment of journalists covering the Libyan story. Agreement After Grenada Invasion **********A few journalists said they saw things differently, however, including James D. Squires, editor of The Chicago Tribune. Mr. Squires said reporters should have been allowed along to witness the fighting, in which Libyan ships and radar installations were hit by American fire. **********The military's restrictions, he said, seemed to violate an agreement struck between the press and the Pentagon after the American invasion of Grenada in 1983. That agreement, prompted by outrage over the treatment of journalists covering the invasion, required the military to include reporters in major military operations. **********''It certainly is a clear departure of the intention of the agreement and the intention expressed by the Government to take us along,'' he said. ''We're not happy.'' **********Bill Kovach, the Washington editor of The New York Times, said the agreement with the Pentagon should have permitted a group of reporters to be ''aboard the ships as they went in, remain there throughout the action and file daily reports.'' **********''This did not happen,'' he said. Instead, the Navy has flown two groups of reporters to the aircraft carrier Saratoga this week and permitted them to remain aboard the ship for several hours at a time. **********Mr. Kovach said this was ''considerably less'' than was offered to journalists who accompanied British ships during the battle for the Falkland Islands in 1982. British reporters, who operate under far more severe press retrains than their American counterparts in other circumstances, were permitted by British authorities to remain aboard the ships during battles with Argentine forces. **********Frustration in covering another major battle this week, the reported incursion of Honduras by Nicaraguan troops, eased considerably today, as reporters were able to move closer to the hostilities. For most of the week, news organizations were entirely dependent on the Reagan Administration for details of the incident. **********The American Newspaper Publishers Association and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, two groups that have been critical of the Pentagon's handling of news coverage in the past, said they had received no complaints about the treatment of reporters and photographers working on stories involving Honduras and Libya. **********Robert L. Burke, a vice president of the publishers association, said the military ''seems to be making a good-faith effort to provide the press with access'' to information about the clashes between American and Libyan forces in the Mediterranean. **********He noted that the hostilities took place sporadically over a large area, which would have made coverage difficult regardless of military restrictions. Moreover, he said, he would find it difficult to criticize the Navy's decision to prevent reporters from passing into waters claimed by Libya. **********''If you take them to the area aboard Navy helicopters,'' Mr. Burke said, ''you're taking real risks, because helicopters would be much more vulnerable to surface-to-air missiles and air-to-air missiles. Even if the journalists are willing to take the physical risks, you still have the problem of risk to the Navy crew aboard.'' Reporters Taken to Carrier **********The Navy has flown two groups of reporters this week from Naples to the aircraft carrier Saratoga, which is participating in the naval manuevers off the Libyan coast but is part of a flotilla far from the fighting. **********Karen DeYoung, a London-based reporter for The Washington Post, was part of the pool today and said reporters were permitted to talk to air crews involved in the fighting. **********In a telephone interview from Naples, she said she was pleased with the access provided to reporters. ''We were able to get some on-scene reports from the airmen giving their description of the attack and counterattack and their own feelings,'' she said. **********Miss DeYoung said she had not asked the Navy to take her beyond the boundary claimed by Libya. She noted that there would probably have been little for a reporter to view. **********''If there had been shooting again, that would have been interesting,'' she said. ''But the fact is there wasn't any action. It was more interesting to be able to see the flight operations in progress on the carrier and to be able to talk to the people involved.'' **********The pool today also included representatives of Reuters, NBC News and United Press International. In a report from the Saratoga, a Reuters correspondent quoted American airmen who said they regretted killing Libyan sailors. **********The pool Monday, which included representatives of Reuters and Newsweek, flew to the Saratoga but the left the ship before the fighting began and was aboard the ship while planes took off to attack Libyan targets. They were returned to Naples late in the day. **********Administration officials made it clear tonight that plans were already under way to start withdrawing the Sixth Fleet on Thursday, unless the Libyans resume military action. **********The Navy ships and planes had been scheduled to leave next Tuesday. Officials said that by custom the United States, like other countries, filed a ''courtesy notification'' with the International Civil Aviation Organization telling the agency of plans to use international airspace in a specified region for a specified time. **********In this case, officials said, the Sixth Fleet told the aviation organization of its intention to conduct operations in international airspace over the Gulf of Sidra until next Tuesday. **********''There's no mandatory requirement to submit a notice of intent,'' a Defense Department official said. ''It's a courtesy notification so that airliners in the region - Libyan airliners, Egyptian, Greek, Tunisian and others - have an idea of what's happening and in what geographical area.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/26/business/company-news-chrysler-amc-in-production-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chrysler, A.M.C.

His new economic program is a ''recognition of reality,'' he said, and is as important for the country as land distribution was six years ago. **********Public reaction to the measures was muted today, but Mr. Duarte and his advisers have reportedly been deeply worried by growing opposition to the much-leaked austerity package.

A much higher rate of 4.85 colons to the dollar was used for all other transactions. **********By setting a single rate of 5 colons, Mr. Duarte's advisers say they hope to establish realistic prices for most goods, as well as end corruption that surrounded the granting of the lower exchange rate to favored importers. **********The most obvious effect of the new, unified higher rate will be an immediate rise in gas prices from about $1.25 a gallon to $1.80, which is still low by Central American standards. Other prices can be expected to rise as well as the effect of the higher cost of gasoline and other imports makes itself felt. In addition, imports of wine, cars, perfume and other products considered luxuries are suspended. Other Actions Soften Blow **********But Mr. Duarte has offered several other measures designed to lighten the burden of his austerity plans. The most obvious was not to impose a new sales tax that his advisers previously had said they were seriously considering. **********Mr. Duarte has been assisted by a doubling in the price of coffee, which accounts for more than half of El Salvador's export earnings and will bring in millions of dollars of unexpected revenues for the next two years. **********Relying on the additional funds, Mr. Duarte has pledged to subsidize basic goods such as corn, oil, beans, rice, sugar, eggs, milk and salt, permitting their prices to be kept artificially low for the consumer. **********The minimum wage for farm workers, who have traditionally been among Mr. Duarte's firmest supporters, will go up, from about a $1 a day to $1.50. For the first time, female farm workers will be paid the same as men. In addition, Government employees will get a $10-a-month raise. **********Coffee growers, who have long been Mr. Duarte's enemies and who lost land and the right to control the export of their coffee under the land distribution, will also benefit. The Government will pay them almost twice as much for their coffee this year. **********The Government program still faces difficulties.

Extraordinary Predicament **********The broad issue for the Court will be whether the extraordinary predicament in which Texaco found itself -facing a bond payment whose size could force the company to seek bankruptcy protection even as it pursued its appeal in the Texas courts -justified the highly unusual intervention by two Federal courts in a continuing state lawsuit. **********Today's brief order came in an appeal by Pennzoil of a Feb. 20 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, that Texaco may post only $1 billion in security for its $12 billion liability to Pennzoil while appealing to the Texas courts. **********The appeals court, affirming in part a Jan. 10 ruling by Federal District Judge Charles L. Brieant, sitting in White Plains, held it would violate due process of law to enforce the Texas bond requirement against Texaco. It also barred Pennzoil from attaching liens to Texaco property while the appeal was pending in the Texas courts. Possibility Is Raised **********Today's action did not indicate how the Supreme Court would ultimately rule in the case, but it at least raised the possibility of a decision in favor of Pennzoil next year, reversing the lower Federal courts. Such a decision could drive Texaco into bankruptcy before it could complete its appeals through the Texas courts from a Texas jury's $10.53 billion award against Texaco last year in a suit by Pennzoil. **********On the New York Stock Exchange today, Pennzoil shares rose $1.125, to $51.25, while Texaco's shares were down $1, to $32.625. **********The damage award, by far the largest in history, was for what the jury found to be Texaco's illegal interference with Pennzoil's plans to acquire three-sevenths of Getty in early 1984. Texaco acquired Getty for $10.1 billion. With interest on the $10.53 billion jury award running at about $3 million a day from early 1984, Texaco's total liability now exceeds $12 billion. **********Pennzoil's appeal in the case, Pennzoil v. Texaco, No. 85-1798, urged the Supreme Court to reverse ''an unprecedented intrusion by a Federal court into ongoing state court proceedings, opening a yawning breach in the wall of statutes and judicial doctrines erected by Congress and this Court as a barrier to just such intrusions.'' **********Texaco's brief urging the Court not to hear the appeal asserted that it had been ''literally within days of bankruptcy'' before it won a reprieve from Judge Brieant. It said that ''the only plausible explanation for Pennzoil's current appeal is to keep settlement pressure on Texaco.'' **********The Supreme Court's decision will not immediately alter the legal or bargaining positions of the feuding companies, both sides said today. **********But a Supreme Court ruling in Pennzoil's favor, even if it did not come for another year, could once again leave Texaco in dire financial straits, according to lawyers involved in the case. **********As the case stands, Texaco is free to pursue its appeal of the Texas judgment without the threat of having to post the potentially ruinous bond. **********Lawyers for Pennzoil said today that the company had no intention, if the opportunity arose, of asking for the full $12 billion, but that it did want some security. **********Pennzoil also denied that it wanted to bludgeon Texaco into a settlement. ''Contrary to what they're saying, we didn't take this to the Supreme Court to pressure them to settle,'' said John Jeffers, one of Pennzoil's lawyers. **********The Supreme Court decision comes during a lull in the on-again, off-again attempts by the companies to settle the case. No negotiations are taking place now, despite pressure on both companies to resolve the high-stakes dispute quickly, according to the lawyers. **********The Standard & Poor's Corporation said today that a reversal of the bond decision by the Supreme Court ''would create acute financial and operating pressure for Texaco and could provide an incentive for a bankruptcy filing.'' But the rating agency added that, if the Pennzoil challenge was rejected, Texaco's debt ratings would probably be raised The pending Supreme Court appeal does not involve the correctness of the damage award and will not directly affect Texaco's pending appeal of that award in a Texas appellate court in Houston. The Court said only that ''probable jurisdiction is noted,'' which means the Justices consider the issues in the case to be substantial enough to fall within the Court's mandatory jurisdiction over appeals from Federal appellate court decisions holding state laws unconstitutional. **********Laurence H. Tribe, the Harvard Law School professor who heads Pennzoil's legal team in the Supreme Court, said in his brief that the Second Circuit's ruling ''invites all losing state court litigants to invent new maneuvers for sideswiping ongoing state court proceedings.'' **********Texaco's Supreme Court legal team, headed by Thomas D. Barr and David Boies of the New York firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, said Mr. Tribe's ''amazing deluge of rhetoric'' could not obscure the fact that the Second Circuit's action was necessary to prevent the destruction of Texaco. 'Substantial Harm' **********The unanimous decision by the three-judge Second Circuit panel, written by Judge Walter R. Mansfield, said imposition of the Texas appeal bond requirement ''would rapidly produce a catastrophe of major proportions, causing substantial harm to Texaco itself and to thousands of others throughout the United States, including stockholders, customers and suppliers.'' **********The Second Circuit rebuked Judge Brieant, however, for questioning the fairness of the Texas trial last year as ''an impermissible appellate review of issues that have already been adjudicated by the Texas court.'' **********The Texas First District Court of Appeals in Houston has set oral arguments in the appeal from the Texas jury's verdict for July 31. Mr. Tribe said in an interview today that he expected there would be no ruling from that court before October and no ruling from the Texas Supreme Court until next spring. **********He said he expected that the Supreme Court would decide the pending appeal from the Second Circuit on the appeal bond issue before the time has expired for whichever side loses in the Texas Supreme Court to seek Supreme Court review of the merits of the case. **********In other business-related cases today, the Justices took these actions: Pension Pre-emptions Rejecting appeals by New York State and 36 former employees of Burlington Industries, the Court summarily affirmed a Second Circuit decision that Federal pension law had pre-empted the state's power to enforce an employer's agreement to make severance payments to terminated employees. **********The Court also summarily affirmed a similar ruling by another Federal appellate court that the Federal pension statute, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, pre-empted North Carolina's power to enforce severance agreements. **********The decisions could have nationwide impact, although the lack of an opinion explaining the Court's reasoning could limit their importance as legal precedents. Thirty-five other states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, had supported New York's unsuccessful appeal, asserting that they and 11 other states had laws to enforce wage payments, and that 31 of these laws included severance benefits. **********The two consolidated New York cases were Roberts v. Burlington Industries, No. 85-441, and Gilbert v. Burlington Industries, No. 85-460. The North Carolina case was Brooks v.

The new system, which is being developed by the intelligence agency, will be sharply different. **********The move apparently arises out of fears by the N.S.A., the nation's largest intelligence agency, that the current system for making computer data unintelligible to eavesdroppers is growing increasingly vulnerable to cracking by foreign governments, terrorists and sophisticated thieves. **********While N.S.A. officials refuse to discuss the change publicly, they have told industry officials in recent weeks that the new system, which will be phased in at Government agencies and corporations beginning in January 1988, will use a variety of new codes whose distribution will be tightly regulated by the agency. The new system would be incompatible with the current one, involving different procedures and different encoding equipment. **********Expansion of U.S. Role **********Experts say that the changes will greatly increase the Government's role in the exchange of data by private institutions and companies, particularly those related to finance and technology. And the proposed new system has already aroused concerns that it could give the N.S.A. easy access to a range of information that currently the Government cannot intercept, except with extraordinary effort. **********''Effectively, it will give the N.S.A. much freer access to data than the agency has today,'' said Robert H. Courtney, a former data security specialist at the International Business Machines Corporation who now runs a private security consulting service. ''You could interpret it as an effort to increase security, or you could interpret it as a power play.'' **********Other experts say that the system would probably be incorporated in a new generation of ''secure'' digital telephones, now under development for use by military contractors and Government agencies, that will encode conversations. **********Among the material that is commonly protected by coding are designs for high-technology products, data about oil and other energy reserves and information about financial transactions. Government officials have become concerned that all of that material is increasingly subject to manipulation or outright theft as more of it is transmitted between computers. Agency's Responsibilities **********The N.S.A. is charged both with protecting sensitive domestic communications - so far primarily involving Government data - and monitoring worldwide communications for the nation's military and intelligence communities. The agency, a branch of the Pentagon headed by Lieut. Gen. William E. Odom, uses a vast network of satellites and sensors in its surveillance activities. **********However, until now the agency has played almost no role in guarding sensitive but unclassified data transmitted by private industry - such as communications between automatic teller machines and bank computers, between banks and the Federal Reserve, or among oil, agricultural or high-technology companies. But under the new system, the agency would control virtually the entire coding procedure, and might have exclusive access to the computer programming that produces the codes needed to decipher the messages. **********The plan for the new system grows out of a controversial national security directive signed by President Reagan in 1984. The directive gave the Defense Department, and by extension the N.S.A., a major role in improving computer security for the Government and for private computer systems processing ''unclassified but sensitive information that could adversely affect national security.'' **********The Government generally has no authority to order the private sector to use the new system. But if Government agencies, like the Federal Reserve, make the switch, then banks dealing with the Fed, for example, would have severe logistical problems if they did not follow suit. Current System **********Currently, companies seeking to encode their sensitive data usually turn to a standard system devised nearly a decade ago by the National Bureau of Standards and I.B.M. That system has two elements: a publicly available set of equations, or ''algorithm,'' that scrambles the message, and a 56-digit electronic ''key'' that must be known to both the sender and the recipient. The two are used together in an intricate mathematical calculation, performed by specially designed computer equipment, to encode and decode the text. **********There are millions of possible key combinations and the keys are changed frequently by users of the system. While the Government helped to design the current system, it has no special advantage in determining a particular key being used. **********Security experts say there have been no known successful efforts to defeat the basic algorithm, called the Data Encryption Standard, although it is widely believed that high-speed computers could unlock a ''key'' by trying the millions of possible combinations. But N.S.A. officials have said privately that they do not want to entrust a rising volume of sensitive data to a coding system whose major elements have been widely published for some time. 'In the U.S. Interest' **********In a letter appearing last month in a narrowly distributed newsletter, published by the Datapro Corporation, the N.S.A.'s deputy director for information security, Harold E. Daniels, wrote that the use of the Data Encryption Standard ''has spread to sensitive applications which has made it an increasingly attractive target for our adversaries.'' **********''Therefore, we have determined it is in the U.S. interest to introduce new cryptographic algorithms'' into commercial communications networks, Mr. Daniels wrote. The N.S.A. would not comment on the letter or permit an interview with any agency officials working on the project. **********Details of the new system are still unclear. But experts who attended a conference on data security last month on the West Coast, where some elements of the program were described, say that unlike the Data Encryption Standard, the new algorithms will not be publicly available. Instead, they will be buried in computer chips manufactured to N.S.A. specifications, and encapsulated so that any effort to read the code with sophisticated equipment would destroy the chip. **********''I don't think that the people using the code would even know the algorithm,'' said Edward Zeitler, the manager of information systems security at the Security Pacific National Bank in California. ''We probably couldn't break our own codes.'' Control of 'Keys' at Issue **********Still unresolved is the question of who will control the numerical ''keys'' that lock and unlock the messages. Currently, banks and companies using the Data Encryption Standard devise their own keys, usually changing them frequently. By some accounts, under the new system the N.S.A. would distribute keys - probably limiting them to companies in the United States. **********But others say that would pose huge logistical problems, and become particularly difficult when a company wanted to communicate with one of its foreign subsidiaries. ''Having the N.S.A. manage our keys seems crazy to us,'' Mr. Zeitler said. **********The N.S.A.'s action comes in the midst of a broad effort by the Reagan Administration to vastly improve the security of data communications, both in government and industry. Until recently, only the Defense Department and its contractors made extensive use of encryption. But in recent years, experts both inside and outside government have become convinced that communications among civilian agencies like the Agriculture Department or the Internal Revenue Service, and within key high-technology companies, oil companies and banks, are also vulnerable to tampering. Concerns in Congress **********But the national security directive signed by President Reagan in 1984 has raised concerns on Capitol Hill and among civil liberties groups because it potentially gives the Defense Department control over a range of nonmilitary communications. And already, there are charges that the move to change encryption techniques is less motivated by fears that the current system is faulty than by fears that it is becoming too widespread. **********''You might argue that the current encryption system, combined with the powers of cheap personal computers, makes the N.S.A.'s other job - eavesdropping - even harder,'' said one Government employee who has worked on data encryption at a civilian agency for several decades. ''To the extent they can, they would like to devise the codes, and have an easier time breaking them.'' **********But even opponents of the N.S.A. moves concede that the agency would probably have little interest in the vast majority of communications and financial transactions that take place between computers. **********Moreover, N.S.A. officials have told bankers, the biggest users of the current system, that there is no reason for them to switch over any time soon. ''Initially, this will be only for the Department of Defense and the people they deal with,'' said one official of the Federal Reserve, which makes wide use of the Data Encryption Standard. ''But in about five years, I think the new system will begin to spread.'' Industry Opposition Seen **********What may impede the N.S.A. effort, some believe, is opposition from the computer industry. A number of companies have invested millions of dollars in the current encryption system, designing chips and computers specially for the purpose. **********I.B.M., for example, encodes about 80 percent of its internal communications using the system, and sells the equipment to other companies. In the past few years, a host of companies, including the Intel Corporation and Motorola, have marketed special chips that can be inserted in small computers to encode their transmissions, costing from $500 to $2,000. **********''The problem is that the current standard is coming into very rapid use now - it's being built into bank teller machines and into PC's,'' said Mr. Courtney, the security consultant. ''It's not easy to switch horses, and it's not clear that we need to.'' **********The new N.S.A. codes appear certain to call for entirely new equipment, experts say, probably manufactured by many of the same semiconductor and computer makers who currently base products on the Data Encryption Standard. And officials of the National Bureau of Standards, who privately say they oppose the plan but that they are compelled to support it publicly, contend that the N.S.A.'s desire to keep the distribution of the new equipment somewhat limited would probably make it more expensive to manufacture. **********''Our fear,'' said one official, who asked not to be named, ''is that in all the confusion that comes from switching standards, companies will delay encoding anything. That's the biggest danger.'' **********Bank officials also point out that while the N.S.A. has said it will withdraw its support for the Data Encryption System in 1988, the agency has yet to demonstrate its replacement system. **********''I think that it is going to have to be demonstrated to us that the new system is as good as the old one,'' said Mr. Zeitler, the Security Pacific National Bank official. ''So far, we haven't seen a thing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/10/business/finance-new-issues-euromarket-sale-of-currency-units.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Euromarket Sale Of Currency Units", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Euromarket Sale Of Currency Units", "body_text": " **********Salomon Brothers International is offering in the Euromarket ''put'' and ''call'' warrants for European Currency Units, a basket of 10 European currencies. **********Each of the 15,000 call warrants allows the holder to buy 10,000 ECU's at a price of 87.65 cents, and they may be exercised for one year.

Regular Sessions Continue **********Their trials continue, in regular sessions whose atmosphere Ali Taygun, a defendant in the Peace Association case, described as ''Kafkaesque.'' **********After 37 months in jail, Mr. Taygun, 43 years old and a leading theater director, was among the last to be freed, in March. He is a graduate of the Yale Drama School, and such theatrical figures as the playwrights Arthur Miller and Harold Pinter have visited here as part of an international campaign to get him acquitted. **********Although the Isvans and Mr. Taygun have spoken freely about their feelings to Turks and in the Turkish press, they say they fear that speaking openly to foreigners may expose them to prosecution under another law. **********The peace group defendants are handicapped because their lawyers, who had been charged in a separate indictment with the same offense, have now had their trials joined. This puts the lawyers among the accused rather than at the defense table. **********Accounts in the Turkish press and circulating widely among intellectuals indicate that the military judges who sit in both cases view all left-wing activity as Communist and inspired by the Soviet Union. At one session of the peace group case, for example, the judge read at length from a document purporting to be the last will of Czar Peter the Great of Russia, who died in 1725, and proclaiming a Russian plan for world domination. **********Few defendants have been told what specific acts they are charged with. Ties to United States **********For people accused of following Soviet orders, the Isvans and Mr. Taygun speak wistfully of the United States. Two of the Isvans' three children live there - a daughter who is a student at the University of Wisconsin and a son who is an engineer in Boston. **********''It has been a home to me, and I have fond memories and no bad memories,'' said Mr. Taygun of his days in the United States. **********The director has been invited to stage a play of his choice at the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. Although he has little hope of being granted a passport, he said he would apply. But he said he did not intend to seek asylum. **********''I will live and work primarily in Turkey as long as I live,'' he wrote in a recent letter. ''But I want that to be a result of my free choice and not a sort of punishment.

He was flown to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, where he was hospitalized with a bullet wound in the head that partly paralyzed him. **********Increasing Libyan Influence **********The decision to evacuate dependents was reached amid signs of increasing Libyan influence in the Sudan. Khartoum announced today that it was recalling its Ambassador to Washington for consultations as a sign of unhappiness over the raid against Libya. Since the American bombing raids there have been large-scale Sudanese demonstrations against the United States. **********In Khartoum, several hundred protesters tried to storm the United States Embassy today but were turned back by Sudanese police using tear gas. **********Because of the security threats, most Americans in the Sudan have been told not to go to the embassy, officials said.

And the bank board considers the larger bank holding companies the most likely acquirers of these institutions. **********''This is tied to the whole developing scene that you have to make it easier for out-of-state takeovers of brain-dead thrifts,'' said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association. But Mr. Guenther added that the proposed easing of the restrictions ''simply chips away at the myth that a thrift and a bank are separate institutions; for all practical purposes, the thrift is becoming a bank.'' **********The proposal was also greeted with skepticism in the thrift industry. ''Our position is that the restrictions were appropriate when they were put in place, and we think they still are appropriate,'' said William B. O'Connell, president of the United States League of Savings Institutions, the thrift industry's largest trade group. **********''It seems that Citicorp wants to operate its thrifts as banks, and I don't see any reason why the Fed should want to change its mind at this point.'' **********In its proposal, the Fed noted that the dynamics of the banking and thrift industry had changed significantly in recent years. It asked whether the deregulation of interest rates, the increasing similarity of powers of banks and thrift units and the spread of interstate deposit taking in both industries merited some change in the restrictions. **********But Citicorp denied it was seeking to expand its interstate banking operations or branching network. **********''The Fed's proposal emphasizes that it does not want this to lead to expanded interstate banking, and it is our intention to maintain these as thrift institutions separate from our commercial banking operations,'' said Robert Thompson, a vice president and general counsel of Citicorp's individual bank division. ''But I think the Fed recognized the validity of our comments in terms of the rescue of the troubled S.&L.'s.'' **********In its proposal, the Fed noted that Citicorp had bought three large troubled thrift units in recent years in California, Florida and Illinois. Federal law permits a banking organization to acquire a thrift unit only if it is insolvent. **********However, in permitting the acquisition of these thrift units by bank holding companies, the Fed imposed a series of restrictions. They prevent the thrift unit from being operated as a bank subsidiary and giving the thrift unit a competitive advantage over local institutions. **********In February, Citicorp asked the central bank for relief to permit joint marketing and sales between a banking parent and its thrift unit, cross advertising and certain affiliate transactions. Citicorp asserted that the restrictions placed the bank at a competitive disadvantage with local thrift units and commercial banks. **********Though the Fed has approved several purchases of troubled thrift units by banks, Citicorp is the only institution that has petitioned for relief, according to Fed officials. **********Under the Fed's proposal today, Citicorp's real estate lending affiliate and its thrift unit would be permitted to solicit business jointly from a real estate developer.

And when Dawn and Misha came to hug Mrs. Sadat, a Disney employee quickly rearranged the grouping so that Mickey joined her at its center. Click. Flash.  The pictures went out over the news wires, and the next morning, photographs of Mickey Mouse, Mrs. Sadat and the children took up one quarter of the front page of the Orange County section of The Los Angeles Times, which two days earlier had carried a long article on the Walt Disney Company's aggressive new policy of self-promotion, which uses Mickey Mouse as its point man. **********Show Business Marketing **********''We have just completed the second year of very, very aggressive marketing,'' said Erwin D. Okun, the company's vice president of corporate communications. ''I don't think we have anything to be ashamed of in marketing our product. That's the business we're in, show business -not curing cancer.'' Mr. Okun paused and added, ''I think I just stole a line from Michael Eisner, our chairman.'' **********The company's decision to be host to the children the night of Nov. 13 was not initially part of Disney's promotion plans. Nor was the concept Disney's. **********The idea of involving the children of different nations in a peace movement originated four years ago with Patricia Montandon, a tall, radiant San Francisco personality, socialite and philanthropist who attracted the support of Mrs. Sadat, the widow of the assassinated Egyptian President. Ms. Montandon says she turned to Disneyland after realizing that she had begun a competition among children for the best art works promoting the idea of peace, but did not have the means to be host to the winners. **********Mr. Eisner and Frank G. Wells, who were hired from Hollywood as the new chairman and president of Disney two years ago after the company was shocked by a takeover attempt, have been on a campaign to reawaken consumer interest in Disneyland, Walt Disney World and Disney pictures. **********''We talked to them about this, and they liked it,'' said Bob Roth, the publicity manager for Disneyland. ''They said: 'Yeah, let's do this. It's a good cause.' '' **********Thirty-eight children from as many countries flew to Los Angeles with their escorts, and Disney and the Disneyland Hotel, owned by the Wrather Corporation, fed and housed and entertained them for a week during the off-season, inviting 1,500 guests to the ceremony itself, where almost 200 Disney employees performed. **********Ms. Montandon asked Bonita Granville Wrather, chairman of the Wrather Corporation, to join Mrs. Sadat in presenting the awards, and at dinner one night, as Ms. Montandon recalled it, one of the Disney executives told her: ''We must be careful not to commercialize this.'' **********But then, she added, ''He said, 'Next year - How many nations are there in the U.N.? One-hundred and sixty? - could we get 160 kids here?' '' Aggressive New Moves **********Since Mr. Eisner and Mr. Wells took over in September 1984, Mr. Okun said, that kind of aggressive spirit has brought the ''Disney Sunday Movie'' back to network television. It has led to the installation of a toll-free 800 line at Disneyland, to handle queries about attractions and accommodations. It has taken Mickey, Donald Duck and the other characters to 120 cities, touring hospital wards and marching in parades. **********Last month, the all-important mouse visited the Great Wall in China. And so when the editor in chief of People's Daily in Peking received an invitation to spend five free days at Disneyland, covering the children's peace awards, a telex went from Peking to Washington, instructing Jing Xianfa, one of the publication's two United States correspondents, to stand in for the editor. **********Of the unpublicized number of foreign and domestic reporters invited to spend time here, only Mr. Jing and Herman Verstraelen, editor of the new daily children's edition of Gazet Van Antwerpen in Belgium, flew here at their newspapers' expense to become Disney's guests. Free Travel, Food, Lodging **********It was a far cry from the crush of 10,600 people - mainly small-town journalists, disk jockeys and other employees of the American communications industry, and their companions - who flew at Disney's expense to Orlando, Fla., in October, where they received free lodging, food and entertainment for a long weekend in celebration of Walt Disney World's 15th anniversary. **********When Mr. Eisner, the Disney chairman, was questioned about the relationship between Disney and the news industry, he characterized it as ''a marriage between the Disney Company and the media, to let the American people know what we have here.'' **********Some newspapers, primarily from big cities, took strong exception to that role, but most of those in attendance did not. ''I know there were at least 2,000 publications represented,'' Mr. Okun said, ''and the publicity has been 99 percent positive.'' **********Like one man, the owner of a string of small-town weeklies, many of those publications had historic relationships with Disney and its affiliates. The weekly publisher, who said he did not want his name used, explained that one of his biggest advertisers was Premier Cruise Lines, the ''official cruise line of Walt Disney World.'' It offers family vacation packages of three or four days spent aboard a ship in the Caribbean, plus three or four days at a resort hotel near Disney World, with free passes to the theme park. **********The publisher was going for free to Disney World. ''It's a reward for stories you've done,'' he said. ''They are smart. They know your production.'' There, he would collect the prepared features about Disney World, already written by Disney's publicity staff. Then, he said, also for free, ''we're going on the cruise, and then we'll write quite a few stories.'' These articles would be the ones produced by Disney, he said, embroidered with quotes from the small-town tourists he met on the trip. **********His papers would print these feature articles, he said, if the travel agencies in the towns where he had papers bought advertisements featuring the cruises and Disney World. ''There's nothing new,'' he said. ''It's common sense.'' **********Mr. Okun, hearing that tale, put it differently. He echoed the theme that Disney is sounding for itself these days: ''Sounds like an aggressive entrepreneur.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/10/business/business-people-four-change-positions-in-xerox-restructuring.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1986-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 361, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Four Change Positions In Xerox Restructuring", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Four Change Positions In Xerox Restructuring", "body_text": " **********The Xerox Corporation announced moves yesterday to revise its marketing operation and to further integrate its copier and office-systems businesses.

Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, among the topics discussed, but it shed no light on the substance of the exchanges. **********A letter from Mr. Gorbachev on arms control matters was delivered by the visitor, but there was no clue as to its contents beyond an announcement that Mrs. Thatcher had been invited to make an official visit to Moscow. **********British diplomats said before the meeting that Mrs. Thatcher would not seek to mediate between Moscow and Washington on issues under negotiation at the Geneva arms control talks. **********But the British Government, which expressed distress last month at the Reagan Administration's announcement that it would no longer feel bound by the ceilings in the unratified 1979 strategic arms limitation treaty, was reportedly hoping for evidence that Mr. Gorbachev's most recent proposals signaled a change in the Soviet negotiating position. **********Mr. Shevardnadze is the first high-ranking Government and party official to visit Britain since the expulsion 10 months ago of 31 officials of the Soviet Embassy. The expulsions followed the defection here of Oleg A. Gordiyevsky, who was identified as the K.G.B. station chief in Britain. Officials said the Shevardnadze visit showed that the strain that the expulsions placed on British-Soviet relations had eased. **********The Downing Street session was preceded this morning by three hours of talks between the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, and Mr. Shevardnadze, followed by a working lunch at the Foreign Secretary's official country house at Chevening in Kent. The visitor was reported to have asked Sir Geoffrey's views on South Africa, which the Foreign Secretary will visit this month on behalf of the 12-nation European Community. Proposal on Chemical Weapons **********The British used the morning session to attempt to interest the Soviet side in a proposal intended to break an impasse in talks on a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons. British diplomats attach considerable importance to the proposal in view of the use by Iraq of chemical weapons in its conflict with Iran and the announced intention of the United States to modernize its chemical-weapon stockpiles if agreement on a ban is not reached. **********The British proposal, which will be formally presented on Tuesday at the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, focuses on technical issues of verification. The United States has been demanding mandatory on-site inspections anywhere, at any time, when one signatory to the treaty challenges another in what it deems to be suspicious circumstances. The Soviet Union has accepted the principle of routine inspections but has insisted on a right to refuse swift access by international inspectors in response to a challenge from another country. **********The British proposal tries to bridge the gap by keeping the challenge mechanism but allowing the challenged country to propose some means of verification other than on-site inspection. British officials said Mr. Shevardnadze had expressed interest in the idea. **********Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Shevardnadze posed briefly on the steps of 10 Downing Street. Before stepping into a black Rolls-Royce and driving past groups of demonstrators chanting anti-Soviet slogans, he tossed off a brief response in Russian to reporters who asked how the talks had gone. ''It's quite a conversation that we had,'' his interpreter said, relaying the message. **********Mr. Shevardnadze and Sir Geoffrey will meet again on Tuesday, and Mr. Shevardnadze will then be present for question time in the House of Commons, the period when Mrs. Thatcher and other Cabinet members take a public lambasting of a kind that falls outside the experience of members of the Soviet Politburo.

But it was not until November, when interest rates made houses more affordable, that they found a buyer for the four-bedroom house they had owned for 22 years. **********The Casmers then approached J. Roger Glunt, a Pittsburgh-area builder who specializes in single-family homes selling for $100,000 to $150,000 and whose business, he said, is now the best it has been in five years. Besides customers, he says he has banks pouring in the door. ''They're flooding us with rate sheets saying, 'Hey! We've got money!' '' **********Next, the Casmers went to one of these lenders, Mellon Bank, which had knocked its rates for 15-year and 30-year conventional mortgages below 10 percent at the start of the year, sooner than most other lenders. ''We are probably doing in the vicinity of $20 million a month in western Pennsylvania,'' said Gary Frauenhotz, executive vice president in charge of mortgage banking. ''That compares with $3 million to $4 million a month a year ago.'' The bank granted the Casmers a 9 1/2 percent, 30-year loan. As Pittsburgh goes, so goes the nation. **********Any economist, businessman or politician who just a few months ago predicted anything akin to the current combination of mortgage rates that dip into single digits, inflation of 3 to 4 percent and $15 oil could not have found a job even in that citadel of American optimism, the White House, or in the thousands of lesser institutions that trade on economists' foresight. **********Yet the economy has delivered itself of just such a mix of extraordinary good news. And if the booming stock market is any indication, spirits across the land are soaring. Interest rates, dropping into territory not seen since the 1970's, have been the single most important set of numbers, buoying the mood and kicking off Wall Street's heady rise. And the good times - heralded by a new era of lower lending rates - seem here to stay awhile. **********Some pessimists, of course, warn that it could all blow away in the summer breeze, with a dive of the dollar or a reversal of oil prices. Some also caution that if good times are coming, many narrower components of the economy - such as business investment or automobile sales - have yet to point that way. **********But the fundamentals are overwhelmingly good. During the past year, interest rates have dropped 3 percentage points on average; many economists see them slipping still a bit more this year before they settle on a gentle low plateau for the balance of the 80's. Lending, more than any other force, makes the economy go 'round, and analysts now speak of an explosion of borrowing and spending to keep the economy growing for years. **********None of the leading economic forecasters can see a recession for at least several years. Instead, they see growth of 3 percent annually, which is about what the economy requires to grow ad infinitum without giving rise to higher inflation. That means Ronald Reagan, with three straight years of economic growth under his belt, may now be presiding over the debut of the longest stretch of low-interest-rate prosperity since Eisenhower. **********''All the ingredients that were so troublesome 5 and 10 years ago are falling into line,'' said Fabian Linden, consumer econo-mist at the Conference Board in New York. ''Lower interest rates mean there's money around to do all the things that money does. It buys factories. It buys houses. It buys cars. Lower interest rates mean we can use money more lavishly. Then we get oil. That's a tremendous serendipity. We appear to be moving into a new era of vigorous growth.'' Rarely, he said, has he seen such promise for prolonged growth - and lower interest rates are the key to his optimism. **********''I can't foresee anything that would push us into a high-interest- rates, high-inflation kind of world,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, head of the St. Louis forecasting firm that bears his name. Compared to five and six years ago, said Peter L. Bernstein, of the consulting firm Peter L. Bernstein Inc., ''interest-rate peaks are lower and the lows are lower: That is probably the way it's going to be.'' As a result, he said, ''I think the world is going to have another boom. I don't know when it's going to come, but it's going to come big.'' WITH a respectful eye on the rampaging stock and bond markets, considered by many to be the economy's best prognosticators, many economists are now beginning to invoke the aquatic metaphors of sea changes and tidal waves, creating images as strong as the Roaring Twenties, the Postwar Boom and the Soaring Sixties. The economy, they say, seems to have tamed the business cycle's 20-year pattern of pushing and pulling and settled onto a much more tranquil and healthy course. **********The stock market certainly reflects the good times. Since the start of last year, the Dow has shattered one record after another, racing to almost 1,800 from what from what just a year ago seemed a not-so-bad 1,200. The message is clear: Investors figure that over the next two or three years, corporations will be harvesting profits, from big-spending, big-borrowing consumers, in magnitudes unknown since the last sustained booms of the 50's and the 60's. **********What has happened is a massive change in the inextricable, often volatile, relationship of interest rates and inflation. The United States has completed four years of 4 percent annual inflation - one-third the rate that prices climbed in the 1979-1980 period. And over the past year or so, that sustained improvement has finally persuaded long-term lenders that they can begin to whittle down the inflation premium they build into the price they charge for money. **********As a result, the homeowner's monthly payment on a 30-year, $100,000 mortgage has plunged to $840.87 at the 9 1/2 percent level current in many parts of the country from $1,264.44 five years ago, when the rate was 15 percent. That's about $5,000 extra a year to save and to spend, a boost to all beneficiaries of the homeowner's largesse - from furniture salesmen to travel agents. **********And most other borrowers are reveling in the lower rates, from the corporations that borrow to expand their plants and work forces to the debtors of Latin America. The banks' prime lending rate, on which they base their loans, has dipped to 9 percent, less than half its 21 1/2 percent peak in the winter of 1980 and 1981. Top-rated corporate bonds, over 15 percent at their highs in 1981 and 1982, were down to 10 percent at the end of last year and now are flirting with 8 percent. Automobile loans were 16 percent in 1981. Now they are a bit under 12 percent. **********So-called ''real'' interest rates -the rate after deducting the inflation premium built in by lenders - have been cut in half in the last few years. So far, the only rates that have not budged much are those for personal loans, which seem mired in the high teens, and credit card balances, at nearly 19 percent. Bankers say that those loans cost them more to manage and that they are unsecured, by stocks, real estate or other property, so they are always high. But in time, they say, the tidal push of lower rates will force them down, too. **********Over all, said David A. Wyss, economist at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., each one percentage point decline in average interest rates adds one-third of a percentage point to the growth of the nation's economy in that year, provided it comes early on. Simply put, a three-point decline adds up to about $39 billion on last year's $4 trillion economy. **********And the benefits of lower rates will be filtering through the economy for some time, analysts say. ''The biggest impact is in the housing market,'' Mr. Wyss said, ''and you should see a big surge there when the buying season gets going this spring. You should see more business investment, too, but that's a slower process because of the lead time in placing orders and changing attitudes. Then the dollar: Lower interest rates bring the dollar down, which chases imported goods out of the American market. Then you get exports up, but that doesn't happen in a hurry.'' **********Businesses, he explained, went through wrenching adjustments to high rates and the high dollar. To bring costs in line with foreign competitors, many set up factories and supply lines abroad. It will take a while to convince them that the dollar and rates have settled down to stay, and then a while longer to get the domestic supply lines flowing again. **********Behind the drop in rates, economists cite a confluence of forces pushing in the same encouraging direction for the first time in 20 years. Interest rates, inflation, growth rates, and the exchange rates of currencies of major nations are in better balance than they have been in years. **********They attribute the confluence mostly to two powerful sources. One is the apparent reversal in the course of the American budget deficits - the major culprit, many economists say, behind high American interest rates, the high dollar and major imbalances in the world economy. **********Most politicians doubt that the deficits will fall to absolute zero five years from now as required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law. But most of them, and the economists who sit in judgment, see the deficit falling from 5 percent of gross national product to well under 2 percent by 1990. Such a decline means that much less competition from the Government for credit and therefore, lower rates. Declining rates, moreover, help assuage the political pain of lowering the deficit. **********Evidence of declining deficits feeds through the markets, causing lower rates, and lower rates reduce the Government's cost of borrowing to carry the deficits. The saving on Government interest payments means Congress will not have to cut popular Government programs as much as it would otherwise. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board, which previously contributed to rate rises by tightening money-supply growth in order to slow inflation, has been cheered enough by lower inflation and progress on the deficit to relax its monetary policies. **********The other major source of falling rates is the change in the international economic policies of the Reagan Administration, from a posture of indifference about how other nations manage their economies to a politically driven need to tell them what to do. It needs them to push their rates down along with American rates. Otherwise, the dollar would rise again, making imports rise , at the peril of American jobs. So far all major players in the exercise, from the Federal Reserve to the governments of Japan and West Germany, have been going along with the wishes of President Reagan and his principal agent of change, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d. **********The first big signal of the Administration's new policy was the five-nation statement in September that the dollar had climbed too high and that the group was prepared to drive it down. Then, a a week ago last Friday, the Federal Reserve , in concert with Japan and West Germany, cut the discount interest rate that it charges banks from 7 1/2 percent to 7 percent -one-half its peak in 1981 and the lowest level since 1978. **********Another signal could come during May's seven-nation summit conference in Tokyo. There, the Administration could disclose more of its thinking about setting up mechanisms to align economic policies, including the exchange rates of currencies. **********''The cause of what we're seeing in interest rates is the change in our international economic policy,'' said Albert M. Wojnilower, chief economist of the First Boston Corporation, the investment banking firm. To try to halt the erosion of American jobs by a flood of imported goods, he said, ''the United States is throwing its weight around.'' **********There are some soft spots that worry economists. Consumer borrowers are not likely to be impressed by drops in rates that they do not pay. Banks still charge high rates on credit card balances and for personal loans, and many consumers are not reaping the off-setting benefits of falling mortgage rates. **********Consumers relying on double-digit returns from money market deposit accounts and investments in corporate securities now receive half as much for their money as they did a few years ago. Those who have not switched into stocks have less to spend to keep the economy rolling. **********Beyond that, the economy's mid-winter burps have been many: the jump in the unemployment rate to 7.2 percent last month from 6.6 percent in January, last Friday's report of a sharp drop in the industrial production index for February, Detroit's somber disclosures that it has been producing too many cars, the lanquid state of retail sales, record levels of consumer and corporate debt, modest increases in capital spending, the report that the economy grew a mere 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter last year, evidence that the yawning American trade deficit continues to rise despite the decline of the dollar. Some economists point out that lower rates may reflect that persistent weakness in the economy. **********Others, however, insist that weaknesses showing up in economic indicators this winter bode well for summer - and the summers beyond. Slow growth, by this reckoning, is safer than rapid expansion and will allow rates to tumble even further. **********But some pessimism remains. ''I think the conventional wisdom about everything getting better right now is full of baloney,'' said Sam Nakagama, a Wall Street economist and pamphleteer. ''Oil producers' spending has to drop instantly,'' which is going to produce a severe deflationary shock,'' he said. ''You've got a recession in the oil patch and in Mexico. You've got a farm recession.'' Lower rates and inflation eventually will mean a sounder economy, he said, ''but we have to get there first.'' **********Many businessmen, too, are not yet betting their resurgent profits on investments in factories and machinery to accommodate a prolonged new era of prosperity. The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation says manufacturers expect to raise capital spending this year only 5 percent, down drastically from 18 percent last year. And they are also unsure of what to expect of the battle between Congress and the White House over revising the tax system. Moreover, they say other forces in the economy have to settle themselves out, such as the still-rising tide of foreign competition and the course of the dollar. AT General Motors, said David C. Monro, whose job at the company is to ponder the effects of economic trends on automobiles, ''here's certainly been some intensive ruminating'' because of sliding rates, . He said he writes memos to senior management saying he still sees discouraging signs, although he expects the economy to do better, at least for the next year or two. But the big problem, he said, is that inflation is still a potential threat. **********And some economists who have little argument with forecasts of a lively economy for a couple of years say the promise of a new era of prosperity stretching into the next decade is more murky. Mr. Wojnilower at First Boston says that the Administration's international economic policy, whatever it has done for current rates, could send inflation back up later. **********The policy, he says, discourages price competition among countries in attempting to force the markets to level the exchange rates of currencies, and encourages countries to expand growth of their money supplies. Both factors, he said, pose the risk of higher inflation. **********Like many analysts, he is most wary about the dollar. Despite all the efforts to control it, a binge of speculation could make the dollar sink, causing inflation. Or it could soar again, causing another rise of the trade deficit and the job losses the Government wants to avoid. **********Barring these problems, economists say that a long-running engine of easy credit should accelerate evolutionary changes now at work in the nation. They see vastly more home building to meet the demands of the birth explosion of the late 1940's and 50's, more investment in factories and automation and more growth of service industries, which tend to offset the volatility of manufacturing. **********From 1945 to 1960, Mr. Linden of the Conference Board says, 58 million babies were born, almost twice as many as during the preceding 15 years. ''Those birth-boom kids, from now to the end of the century, are going to be, roughly, 35 to 50 years old,'' he said. ''That's the most expansive phase of the life cycle. Income rises. Borrowing rises. Spending rises.'' **********Home demand among the baby boomers is poised to explode, economists say, because they first started shopping for homes just as rates and real estate prices were soaring. Most economists predict that new home construction, which has been hovering around 1.7 million units annually, will rise to 2 million this year and remain there for at least several more. **********David Reed, economist at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis, said he doubts that the decline in interest rates alone will lead to the kind of extraordinary prosperity that followed World War II. But at the same time he expects better times than the nation witnessed during the high-rate, high-inflation immediate past. **********''I think we are facing an extended period of moderate growth,'' he said. ''In that sense, we are in a very different economy.''

His practice included many stars of the theater, ballet and television - ''I capped the teeth of just about every important rock singer,'' he recalled recently - and their anecdotes of glitz and glamour made it painfully obvious to Dr. Lynn that ''there was more to life than looking into people's mouths.'' **********Dr. Lynn's answer to his mental wanderlust was not the stage - although he does look back with inordinate fondness on a walk-in part that impressario Sol Hurok, a patient, gave him more than 20 years ago in a ballet version of ''Eugene Onegin'' at the Metropolitan Opera House. Instead, the 51-year-old Dr. Lynn derives his excitement from the world of small business. **********He is the founder of Custom Creamery, an ice cream company, that he eventually merged into Orange Julius, one of the largest fast food chains. And he is now chairman and chief financial officer of Tidbit Alley Inc., a chain of 27 bulk-food stores that has just opened its first franchised outlet in Fredericksburg, Va. **********Dr. Lynn is no newcomer to the business world. Like many prosperous professionals, he has long invested in other entrepreneurs' projects - some successful, a few that were not, notably Cinemax, a movie production company that went bankrupt. But unlike most rich investors, Dr. Lynn was certain he could manage those companies better himself. As his wife, Sherry, recalls it, her husband was so frustrated that she suggested that ''Maybe it's time you become your own investor, instead of investing in other people's businesses.'' **********Dr. Lynn took his first crack at active management in 1976, when a patient who owned a Manhattan eatery called Chequers mentioned that he needed a partner. Dr. and Mrs. Lynn, avid restaurant-goers, not only invested, but also acted as host and hostess at the restaurant. For 18 months he fixed teeth by day and greeted diners at night. **********Dr. Lynn wound up selling his share in the restaurant, but he had clearly been bitten by the entrepreneurial bug. And in 1983, he left full-time dentistry for good. Since then he has spent his time shepherding small companies through their initial public stock offerings and early growth stages. **********He still owns his Manhattan dental clinic, but picks up the drill only for an emergency or an occasional celebrity client. He clearly no longer needs the profits from dentistry - the dentist-turned-entrepreneur estimates his current net worth at more than $25 million. **********''These days, I have a whole new life,'' Dr. Lynn said. ''I like to find companies that are barely profitable, take equity positions in them with a few friends, put the deal together, hire professional management, put in some more capital so it can become a more profitable business. My goal is to find 15 companies like that.'' **********At the moment he is concentrating on two - Tidbit Alley and Paralax, a New York video distribution operation that he is planning to expand into a full-scale production company. DR. LYNN is one of a handful of medical professionals who have gone into business full time. Another example is Leon Pordy, a cardiologist who became chairman of the Chock Full o' Nuts Corporation. Many others have part-time business interests: Joseph B. Santo, a dentist, owns four Manhattan restaurants, including Sign of the Dove and Arizona 206. Richard Coburn, a plastic surgeon, breeds, sells and races a stable of a dozen horses in Kentucky, in partnership with three other physicians. **********''A lot of M.D.'s and dentists are leaving the professional world,'' Dr. Lynn said. ''The professional man as a status symbol doesn't exist as much anymore. And with all the cost pressures today, the remuneration they make isn't as attractive.'' With the growing threat of malpractice suits, he added, ''it seems natural to think of new careers.'' **********Dr. Lynn is a tall, affable man with seemingly boundless enthusiasm for his new ventures. He speaks of his professional metamorphosis in surreal terms. ''I began to feel a wanderlust in the mid-1960's,'' he said. ''I realized that I lived in my real world but had this fantasy of getting into a more exciting one. But I wasn't ready yet. I still had a family to support.'' His wife of 28 years uses much blunter language: ''Some men change wives,'' she said. ''He changed careers.'' **********Marvin Maslow, executive vice president of Bartlett, Schlumberger & Company, an investment firm in New York, calls Dr. Lynn ''a natural merchant banker who capitalized on a midlife crisis. He senses an opportunity and he moves quickly.'' **********Still, it took Dr. Lynn three years to make the decision that firmly planted him on the full-time businessman's path. In 1980, he learned of a ''fantastic ice cream machine,'' a contraption that could be situated in a tiny kiosk in a store or shopping center. Drawing upon a variety of syrups, candies, jellies and cookies that lined the kiosk walls, the machine could instantly whip up as many as 2,000 varieties of ice cream, yogurt or tofu, blending a vanilla base with any of the adjacent goodies. In fact, the machine had been around for 30 years, but Dr. Lynn and his partners brought ''romance'' to the marketing concept, according to David Mayer, a co-investor in the project. **********''I had made the commitment to give up my personal participation in dentistry,'' Dr. Lynn said, ''and to become a business entrepreneur. It was a watershed for me and a complete break with the past.'' **********He bought the rights to the ice cream machine and showed it to the F.W. Woolworth Company. Robert Powers, who was in charge of food operations, agreed to try it. After a successful test run, the machines were ultimately installed in 90 Woolworth variety stores. Dr. Lynn incorporated the company as Custom Creamery Inc.; he took his new venture public in 1983 and raised $2.5 million from the initial stock offering. **********In 1984, the company merged with Hawthorne Melody, a private investment concern, giving Custom Creamery fresh capital for expansion. THE Custom Creamery Flavor **********Factories with their 2,000-flavor ice cream machines won a certain following. At military camps, for example, the banana-and-Oreo-cookies combination was reportedly a hit with enlisted personnel; a general in Texas was said to be enamored of pretzel ice cream. **********But the machine did not live up to its promise. Despite refinements, it could not stand up to continuing wear and tear. Dr. Lynn recalled, ''I began to look for a company with a large number of fast food units, mostly franchised,'' so that the company could grow rapidly with a minimum of capital investment. Custom Creamery acquired a number of concerns, including American Videotronics, a distributor of food-vending and cigarette machines. Then in February 1985, Custom Creamery bought Orange Julius, a private company mostly owned by its franchisees, and the combined company assumed the name of its new acquisition. Some months later, Dr. Lynn stepped down as chairman. **********''Working there - and I am still a substantial shareholder in the company - was my M.B.A. in business,'' Dr. Lynn said, referring to the Orange Julius enterprise. ''I felt I could now go on to other things.'' **********He looked up Robert Powers, who had since left Woolworth and become a consultant. When Mr. Powers told him about Tidbit Alley, a chain of four stores selling food in bulk, Dr. Lynn decided to pursue it. ''We found that almost no one had gone into specializing in retailing bulk foods,'' he said, ''and we could visualize Tidbit Alley as a real growth vehicle.'' **********Dr. Lynn and his co-investors bought Tidbit Alley last fall, then took the company public. Since then, the company has opened 20 more stores, mainly in regional malls in Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Jersey; its first New York City unit opened in Greenwich Village in April. **********A typical Tidbit Alley is crammed to the walls with open bins containing several hundred varieties of candies, nuts, dried fruits and other treats. The small stores have annual sales per square foot of $200, compared with an average $100 per square foot for stores of all types. The company expects revenues this year to be between $12 million and $15 million, with pretax profit margins of almost 10 percent, compared with about 3 percent pretax for typical food stores. ''We can do it through a combination of low overhead - each store employs only three people - and buying in quantity, which gives us price advantages,'' Dr. Lynn said. **********In a new venture such as Tidbit Alley or Paralax, Dr. Lynn and his partners will provide seed money to move the enterprise along until they can raise capital through a public stock offering. Over the years, Dr. Lynn has worked variously with as many as 100 private investors, of which about a dozen are frequent partners. Initial individual investments usually range between $500,000 and $1 million. A native New Yorker who grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, Jerry Lynn was the son of a button manufacturer who invested in real estate as a sideline. Early on, the boy was drawn to performers. He formed a teen-age friendship with a neighbor, Bobby Darin, who later became a top pop singer. Mr. Darin told his friend that he should meet Sherry Parsons, a singer who was under contract to the same recording company. ''She's a lovely, pretty lady,'' Mr. Darin said. ''You should get to know her.'' He did and they were married in 1958. **********Her new husband was still a dental student at New York University, so Mrs. Lynn started a small cosmetics business to help pay expenses. She abandoned the venture when she became pregnant, and her husband paid his tuition bills by working part-time as a record salesman at Macy's. After graduation, Dr. Lynn joined the Air Force and was assigned to Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod. Their show business friends were frequent guests: the singers often gave private concerts for the service personnel. **********In 1960, Dr. Lynn opened his own dental practice in Manhattan, specializing in cosmetic dentistry. Again, the show business connections helped. In 1963, for example, Sol Hurok joined the patient roster. When Mr. Hurok brought the Bolshoi, Kirov, Stuttgart and other ballet troups to this country, Dr. Lynn found himself working day and night on a seemingly endless stream of foreign patients. Most of the dancers had long postponed dental work because they were frequently traveling. Mr. Hurok paid the dental bills for many Iron Curtain artists, who were often performing for low pay as part of cultural exchange programs. It was during this period that Mr. Hurok suggested that the dentist might like to make his stage debut. **********Nowadays, Dr. Lynn's day typically starts at 8 A.M., as he checks the mail at his Manhattan dental clinic. The rest of the day a chauffeured limousine shuttles him among his companies - he usually spends mornings at Tidbit Alley and afternoons at the Paralax offices. ''I like to keep my fingers in every pie, from the patients of the day to the companies I manage,'' he said. In the evening he and his wife - still devoted to restaurants - usually eat out. **********The Lynns have homes in New York City and Demarest, N.J. Their three children are grown: Jodi, who is 25, is assistant to the publisher of The Economist; Mitchell, 23, manages the Tidbit Alley store in Manhattan, and Jennifer, 18, is a student at Boston University. In his spare time, Dr. Lynn likes tennis and luxury cars: seven automobiles, including two Ferraris and a Rolls-Royce, are garaged at his Demarest home. **********Mrs. Lynn says she learned early on to stay flexible to keep up with her voluble husband: She likes to tell of a late afternoon when he telephoned from his office and said he was bringing a patient home for dinner. ''I was very pregnant at the time,'' she explained, ''and was annoyed that I would suddenly have to prepare for a guest at dinner.'' But Dr. Lynn put the patient on the phone, and Mrs. Lynn recalled: ''When I heard that rich, French baritone voice introducing himself as Yves Montand, the actor and singer, my entire attitude quickly improved.'' **********Dr. Lynn says that he does not regret the years he spent as a dentist: ''I don't know if I could have made it if I had started as a businessman. But, now, when I sit in on a negotiating session on a new venture, I have a self-confidence based on the fact that if it doesn't go right I can always fall back on my dental clinic.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/08/business/advertising-alvin-hampel-gives-seminars.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Alvin Hampel Gives Seminars", "print_headline": "Advertising; Alvin Hampel Gives Seminars", "body_text": " **********Alvin Hampel, the last chairman of D'Arcy McManus Masius/New York before the agency's merger with Benton & Bowles, has established Hampel Creative expressly to teach marketing geniuses about the facts of advertising. **********Mr. Hampel, 58 years old, came up on the creative side of the agency business, writing copy and supervising the writing of copy at such noted advertising generating stations as Young & Rubicam and B.& B.

The economy, they feared, would slip into recession again in 1986, finally tiring after more than three years of solid growth. **********But the feisty stock market and plunging interest rates have changed all that. Economists all over are expecting another respectable - albeit not sizzling -performance this year. (See graphics display on Page 4.) Exploding stock values have added more than $1 trillion to the nation's wealth over the last 18 months, experts say, giving consumers added confidence and new buying power. But business leaders fear that increased competition at home and abroad could make this a tough year. To flesh out the details, industry by industry, The New York Times asked its own specialists to look ahead for 1986. Here are their reports. **********The shakeout that has been underway for more than a year in commodities futures and options will likely accelerate in 1986, squeezing some marginal players further and forcing larger firms to add significantly to their capital to remain in the business, many experts expect. **********''This industry will be restructured; it's going to happen,'' said Tone Grant, president of Refco Inc., one of the largest futures and options brokerages. ''And this will only happen once in the foreseeable future. What happens now will affect it for a long time.'' **********Several cross-currents are tearing at the commodity business. The shift in trading volume away from traditional agricultural contracts, (such as corn and pork bellies) toward financial products (such as bond and stock index futures) has brought more large financial institutions into the market. Wall Street houses like Goldman, Sachs; Salomon Brothers and Morgan Guaranty have become major brokers and players in just the last few years. Commercial banks, bond dealers, pension funds and thrift institutions have replaced the small speculator and the farmer hedging his crops against price fluctuations as the market's largest participants. **********At the same time, increased competition from these new securities firms and banks has narrowed commissions and made the business less profitable. Exchanges are suffering, too, because some financial services firms, such as commercial and investment banks, are trading futures and options contracts over-the-counter. All this is causing the disappearance of some prominent commodity brokers from the business, such as Conticommodity Services and ACLI International. **********The changes are also exposing the weakness in the industry's capital structure, built to withstand far less financial pressure than today's enormously volatile markets can generate. The collapse in March of Volume Investors, a small Comex firm, demonstrated that neither regulators nor the industry fully understood the delicacy of the firms' financial underpinnings. As a result, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the industry's regulator, proposed stiff new capital rules. Because of opposition from the industry, it delayed instituting the rules but few doubt that tougher requirements will be imposed in 1986, and that some firms will be unable to meet them. Thus, the ranks of commodity brokers are likely to thin further."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/21/business/forstmann-little-to-acquire-sybron.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 360, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FORSTMANN LITTLE TO ACQUIRE SYBRON", "print_headline": "FORSTMANN LITTLE TO ACQUIRE SYBRON", "body_text": " **********The Sybron Corporation and Forstmann Little & Company said yesterday that they had agreed in principle for Forstmann to acquire Sybron in a cash deal worth about $300 million. **********In the offer, the third received by the Rochester-based maker of medical and scientific supplies since last September, Forstmann proposes to pay $26.25 a common share.

Sales are compared on the basis of a daily sales rate. There were seven selling days in the recent period and eight in the comparable period last year. **********For all of November, which had 24 selling days this year and 25 in 1985, sales of domestically produced cars rose 5.2 percent, to 521,074.

For the month, G.M. reported a decline of 9.4 percent, partly because of a strike at the company's Delco electronics plant in Indiana. The plant supplies parts for virtually all G.M. cars and trucks. **********G.M.'s car sales totaled 255,516 for the month, and it reported 91,288 light-truck deliveries, a 19.2 percent decline.

G.M.'s Chevrolet unit is giving $300 rebates on some models, but Ford and Chrysler have more lucrative programs. Most of Chrysler's trucks are on sale, for example. **********Also today, General Motors announced plans to cut production at three large assembly facilities after the holidays, laying off 4,500 workers in Michigan and Missouri for an indefinite period. Ford Car Sales Up 26.7% **********At Ford, car sales rose 26.7 percent, to 48,602, in the last 10 days of the month, and light-truck sales fell 14.8 percent, to 28,822. For all of November, Ford's car sales of 145,425 were 23.8 percent ahead of last year, but light-truck sales of 83,815 were 15.7 percent behind.

Truck sales set a record for the third consecutive month, with deliveries of 42,265, a 39.1 percent increase from last November. Car sales in the month rose 9.3 percent, to 71,830. Chrysler's market share also increased in November, to 12.1 percent, from 10.7 percent in November 1985. **********The American Honda Motor Company reported sales of 15,674 American-built cars in the 10-day period, more than four times its sales last year when its plant at Marysville, Ohio, was being retooled. Since then, Honda has also increased capacity at the plant. For the month, Honda's car sales almost tripled, to 30,308. **********Volkswagen of America Inc. reported sales of 2,450 cars, up 3.9 percent, for the last 10 days of the month.

''Oil prices are down all over the world. In Yugoslavia they are going up.'' **********Among the reasons he listed were that Yugoslavia, with a population of 22 million, supports five oil refineries and five auto plants, more than needed. **********Dr. Stanovcic blamed ''political control of the economy'' for many of the problems and spoke of ''refeudalization'' of its society, saying, ''Dispersion of power without democratization is feudalism.'' **********''It is self-criticism,'' said Vasil Tupurkovski, a 35-year-old Macedonian, who is a member of the ruling party Presidium, or Politburo. **********Self-criticism is a time-honored practice, but it has generally been confined to criticism of the performance of individuals, not directed against the Communist system as a such. **********But the Yugoslavss at the Wilson Center did not shy away from criticizing the system. After a rigorous analysis of ''social stratification,'' Gregor Tomc, a 34-year-old researcher from Ljubljana, said virtually every party move had contributed to ''class decomposition of society.'' **********Since class structure is deemed by Marxist-Leninists to be the basis of society, with the working class in the lead, Dr. Tomc appeared to be attacking a fundamental tenet. **********In this vein he also dismissed traditional Marxist teaching as inadequate in dealing with nationalist issues. **********In the case of Yugoslavia, a multiethnic society, Dr. Tomc said, the causes of Slovenes and Macedonians appear legitimate because they are defensive while those of Serbs, Croats and the Albanian minority are illegitimate because they disturb the status quo. **********There appeared to be agreement among Yugoslavs and Americans speaking on the conference topic, Federal vs. Regional Relationships in Yugoslavia, that the party had entered a period of fragmentation. **********As Dr. Tomc put it, ''The only thing that could hold the country together, the party, is fragmented into eight independent parties.'' **********He was referring to the republican party organizations of Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and of the autonomous regions of Vojvodina and Kosovo. **********Vojislav Kostunica, a Belgrade scholar, called the situation a form of ''party pluralism'' in which each of the eight parties pursued local interests while subscribing to the federal system only on ''a contractual basis.'' **********The Yugoslavs were hardly less blunt than Prof. Steven L. Burg of Brandeis University, who spoke of the ''disintegration'' of political life. **********Appraising the three-day conference, Prof. Mark Baskin of Manhattanville College said, ''Ten years ago we could not have had this.'' **********Nicholas G. Andrews, a retired Foreign Service officer, said, ''There was no defensiveness on the part of the Yugoslavs.'' **********Dennison Rusinow of the American Universities Field Staff, who was designated to edit the conference papers into book form, said: ''It was an extraordinarily frank exchange.

Bay Jr., its publisher, only the automotive is a growth category. The cigarette and liquor industries are pulling back as the result of changes in public tastes and attitudes and threats of Government intervention. **********Gun sales have been severely hurt, Mr. Bay said, by creeping urbanization, which is squeezing out possible hunting areas. (He described it as ''fewer hunting opportunities.'') And gun companies have been financially hurt by suits resulting from product liability laws. **********Arms and ammunition advertising has remained relatively flat in the magazine for the last five years, while tobacco advertising dropped 17 percent and distilled spirits advertising nose-dived 28 percent. **********A couple of years ago, when the three shaky categories were still responsible for 70 percent of the magazine's ad revenues (now they are down to 60 percent), ''we decided,'' the publisher said, ''to do something to refocus our selling efforts in light of the erosion.'' **********The decision was to go to the so-called advertorial supplements, which take editorial material on a particular topic that is usually done by other than the magazine's staff and use it to attract and bind together advertising in a similar area. They are quite the rage in magazine land. **********The decision was to focus on hunting apparel, which was considered a ''natural extension'' of the magazine's editorial content, and food. **********There have already been two annual food sections, which were put together by Patty Hotchkiss, an ebullient freelance talent, that ran 16 pages each, including eight pages of advertising. **********Mr. Bay, a second-generation magazine man, said that although Field & Stream carries food-oriented articles in every issue, selling food companies on a men's magazine goes against the popular belief that women make the buying decisions about food. **********There was no such problem with hunting apparel manufacturers, and in his office yesterday an extremely pleased Mr. Bay said, ''It went off the charts.'' That translates to some $1.5 million in gross revenues. **********The section must have been a nice change of pace for the ad salesman, Michael Edison, formerly of Seventeen magazine, who was assigned full time to the section, which in effect is a how-to on dressing for the kill. **********It was created under the direction of Lyons Advertising of Wilmington, Del., which hired a freelance photographer and writer who were part of an eight-member contingent that flew off to Stewart's Lodge on Lake Nimpo in British Columbia, where local guides and bush pilots were conscripted as models. **********The advertisers in the section are paying $53,655 for a four-color page, a 15 percent premium, and Gene Bay and the gang are trying to give them enough merchandising to make it worthwhile. **********The advertisers that were exhibiting in January at the Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade Show in Houston each got 1,000 preprints of the section for distribution to potential retailers. Additionally, their key retail outlets (a total of 27,000) have been getting quarterly bulletins on the coming section to keep interest keen. **********To further endear advertisers to the retailer, the September issue will run separate dealer listings in each of its five regional editions. Each advertiser was entitled to submit 500. **********And, finally, since point-of-sale can hardly be ignored, counter cards will be distributed to retailers that promote the section and also allow consumers to enter a sweepstakes. **********Planning that sort of going on comes pretty naturally to a guy whose dad was ad director of Conde Nast's House & Garden until he was 70 and became a consultant to Meredith's Apartment Life. **********Bay the younger, now 53 years old, knew through Phillips Andover and the University of Pennsylvania that his life would be in the magazine business, and he had Time Inc. and Curtis in mind. However, a particularly effective recruiter from Triangle Publications' TV Guide ensnared him. That recruiter was none other than Michael J. O'Neill, that ubiquitous adland figure, who was then ad director of the Guide and was later to lure Mr. Bay to CBS Publications' Field & Stream when he was publisher there. The last job was one Gene Bay took even though he had never read the magazine. **********A native New Yorker, Mr. Bay's other lifetime high spots included being an officer in the Marine Corps, spending much of his time playing football under warm Hawaiian skies; ad director of Triangle's first try at Good Food magazine, and his marriage to the former Diedre Lesage of New Orleans, now executive director of the Colonial Dames of America.

It added that it was ''not aware of the source of the rumors.'' **********By the end of the day, Honeywell shares stood at $78.50, up $3.625 a share, after trading during the day between a low of $74.75 and a high of $84.25, with more than two million shares changing hands. **********The stock moved up sharply early in the session, with professional traders attributing the strong showing to a unusually specific report by Steven Mulinovitch, who follows Honeywell for the First Boston Corporation, that Honeywell might announce as soon as noon yesterday that it would sell its military business to the Boeing Company, its mainframe computer operations to the NEC Corporation of Japan and its minicomputer operations to the Bull Group of France. Boeing refused to comment. **********And Honeywell announced only that its directors, in a board meeting on Tuesday, had approved a previously announced plan to form a joint venture with NEC to market supercomputers in this country and Canada. The plan gives NEC, which is just beginning to market supercomputers outside Japan, a vehicle to compete with Cray Research Inc., Minneapolis, by far the largest supercomputer manufacturer in the world. **********Honeywell stock fell sharply after what traders called a ''disappointing'' announcement but then began climbing again as sentiment grew that something might yet develop -even though there was nothing to go on but rumors. **********Mr. Mulinovich did not return repeated phone calls, but traders said that his firm, First Boston, was among a number of firms that had bought Honeywell stock yesterday. **********In Minneapolis, Honeywell's hometown, Gary Blauer, who tracks the company for Dain Bosworth Inc., remarked that while it was ''all rumors,'' there is ''a lot of talk at Honeywell that the computer business is being sold.'' He said he had heard the same story from several ''middle-level people'' at Honeywell. **********''I do think some kind of restructuring is coming for Honeywell somewhere down the line,'' he said. **********He said he thought the computer sales to NEC and Bull were ''plausible.'' Such a sale, he added, would be regarded favorably by Wall Street since the operations, accounting for 30 percent of sales, were ''the least promising part of Honeywell.'' Mr. Blauer said he thought the sale of the military business, representing a fourth of total sales, seemed ''less likely'' because it was ''very profitable and growing nicely.'' **********Commenting on Honeywell's data processing business, he remarked that ''of all the people who might buy the computer business, NEC might be the best one.'' He added: ''It's committed to the business and could use United States distribution. Their products work well with Honeywell's, and they've done business together for decades.'' **********Honeywell's joint venture with NEC, Mr. Blauer said, is ''completely unrelated'' and a sale to NEC and Bull was still plausible. Honeywell, moreover, owned nearly half of Bull until the French nationalized the company four years ago. The two still maintain close marketing and technological ties although Honeywell now owns less than 5 percent of Bull. **********On a note of caution, he added that ''personally, I'd be nervous about investing on this kind of speculation but it could happen,'' adding, ''The rumors don't want to die.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/20/business/lucky-stores-to-study-offer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lucky Stores To Study Offer", "print_headline": "Lucky Stores To Study Offer", "body_text": " **********Lucky Stores said Friday that its board would consider a sweetened offer from Asher B.

He added that the Presidential election on Feb. 7 was ''of great importance to the future of democracy.'' **********''If the will of the Filipino people is expressed in an election that Filipinos accept as credible - and if whoever is elected undertakes fundamental economic, political and military reforms - we should consider, in consultation with the Congress, a significantly larger program of economic and military assistance for the Philippines for the next five years,'' he said. **********Many Filipinos Fear Unrest **********In Manila, meanwhile, there was growing fear of possible unrest and reprisals after the election and many people, particularly foes of President Ferdinand E. Marcos, said they were making contingency plans.  [ Page A10. ]  A Reagan Administration official, when asked about the policy changes being sought by the United States, said they involved essentially an overhaul of the military and of the economy. **********''The kinds of things we are talking about are military reform, which means both retirement of overstaying generals, reform of military leadership, more emphasis in the military on promoting people based on their performance and ability to combat the insurgents,'' he said. **********In the economy, he added, the United States seeks an end to the domination of large monopolies - many of them, officials have said, controlled by associates of the Marcos family. Reagan Endorsing Observers **********The official said the White House statement was intended to strengthen the importance of the American observer delegation going to the Philippines for the election and ''give it the Presidential imprimatur.'' **********He said the statement also sought to demonstrate to Congress, as well as to the Philippines, that the Administration sought to accelerate the degree of United States involvement in the Philippines so long as the elections were considered fair, and policy changes follow. **********What ultimately concerns the United States, officials said, is the potential for chaos in the Philippines if no changes are effected, leading to an eventual Communist takeover. **********''Whoever wins this election is still going to face major problems,'' an official said in the White House press room. ''The Philippines has a badly deteriorated economy. It has a dangerous Communist insurgency, a most vicious one, one that would really spell the end of all hopes for human rights in the Philippines and for the future of that country if it wins. **********''It is going to require significant efforts by whoever wins this election, efforts that in our view must include significant reforms of the military and of the economy to defeat the insurgency.'' **********The observer delegation, which is tentatively set to leave Feb. 4, will be led by Senator Richard G. Lugar, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. The names of the other members have not been announced. U.S. Has Not Taken Sides **********The election pits President Marcos against Corazon Aquino, widow of Benigno Aquino Jr., an opposition leader who was killed at Manila Airport in 1983 as he returned from exile. The United States has not taken sides in the election. **********''Our policy is not to emphasize personalities but to emphasize institutional reform,'' the official said. **********He indicated that the Administration had no plans to reduce military aid to the Philippines even if Mr. Marcos won and failed to carry out the changes sought by the United States. **********''We are not going to solve the problems of the Philippines by distancing ourself from the country,'' the official said. ''We are not going to make the problems there better by terminating military assistance. That, in fact, is a recipe for disaster. The stability and the future of that country depend on an effective military.'' **********Officials declined to speculate how much more aid would be sought. Last year's request of $102.2 million in military aid was cut by Congress to $54.7 million, with some of the cut shifted to economic aid. Economic aid was authorized at $184.2 million.This year's request is $102.7 million in military aid and $125.7 million in economic aid, according to Congressional sources. **********Mr. Reagan, in his statement, said the election ''comes at a time when the Philippines is struggling with the urgent need to re-establish a political consensus, restructure the economy and rebuild a sense of military professionalism.'' **********He said the Communist Party, through its military arm, the New People's Army, and its political organization, the National Democratic Front, ''is pursuing a classic military and political strategy intended to lead eventually to a totalitarian takeover of the Philippines. **********''The Communist strategy can be defeated,'' he said.

Gorbachev, have begun one of the most extensive public relations efforts of the Reagan Presidency. **********The officials say their goal is to reverse the emphasis of newspaper and television reports that, in their view, portrayed President Reagan's adherence to the Strategic Defense Initiative as the major reason for the leaders' failure to agree on a major arms control accord in the meeting last weekend in Iceland. **********President Reagan and his key advisers today began a series of interviews and speeches that, according to White House aides, are aimed at placing the blame for the outcome on the Soviet leader. **********As part of the effort to get domestic support and counter potential criticism abroad, Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said today that all officials would speak on the record. **********''It is a part of our policy on this meeting to tell everything, to be totally open and to answer questions on the record and by name attached to the individual talking,'' Mr. Speakes said. Such a policy is an extraordinary move in an Administration where most officials - like their recent predecessors - prefer that their comments to the press remain anonymous. High Officials Involved **********The decision places such high officials as Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, the head of the National Security Council, as well as President Reagan at the center of a television, newspaper and magazine push to challenge Soviet propaganda and increase support for the Administration and the military plan known as ''Star Wars.'' **********''From the early instant analysis, all you got was that the summit collapsed because the President was intransigent on S.D.I.,'' said Patrick J. Buchanan, Director of White House Communications, referring to the Strategic Defense Initiative. ''That's simplistic and false. We have the whole story. So Regan, Shultz, Poindexter and the President are going on the record in as many forums as we can to tell the story.'' **********But it became almost immediately apparent today that there were limits to the new pronouncement. **********At a briefing, Mr. Shultz was asked about how much ''Star Wars'' research might be permitted under the Administration's interpretation of the treaty that curbs antiballistic missiles. **********Mr. Shultz said: ''Our position is as I've stated it, and I'm not going to get into, in a sense, bargaining about it with you. So, I don't think it's necessary that you know all of our positions.'' **********The reporter then asked, ''You don't think it's necessary if we understand what the U.S. Government's understanding of the ABM treaty is?'' **********Mr. Shultz replied, ''I think we are engaged in a process with the Soviet Union and we're going to conduct it.'' **********Still, Mr. Buchanan called the Administration public-relations campaign ''extraordinary,'' saying, ''It's the most extensive and intensive communications plan I've ever been associated with in the White House.'' Mr. Buchanan worked at the White House under President Nixon and joined Mr. Reagan in his second term. **********''Basically, our story is this,'' he said. ''The President made the most sweeping, far-reaching arms control proposal in history. Gorbachev said 'No.' He made a nonnegotiable demand that the President give up S.D.I. and the President said 'No.' '' **********White House officials are plainly concerned about public reaction to the deadlock at meeting in Reykjavik. Concern on Political Impact **********With the November congressional and gubernatorial elections nearing and the political impact of events in Iceland uncertain White House officials were especially eager to put the best face on the Reykjavik meeting. **********Congressional leaders have said the failure in Iceland will make the Administration face more questions and deeper scrutiny on the ''Star Wars'' proposals, and more intense pressure for progress on arms control talks. **********Mr. Shultz told reporters that Mr. Reagan told associates after the talks ended that he wanted all the facts and details of the Iceland summit to be made public. **********Mr. Speakes, in his announcement today about disclosing information about the Iceland meeting, said, ''We think it's important that we discuss the meeting fully, because it's a meeting of historic importance.'' Caution by Speakes **********Mr. Speakes did not explicitly rule out the possibility that officials would speak anonymously, but warned that such comments might not be authoritative. ''If you receive information on a background basis from a senior Administration official, from here on out that senior Administration official may not be plugged into what's going on,'' he said. **********Mr. Reagan spent almost all day today publicly discussing the Iceland meeting. He met with congressional leaders for more than an hour this morning, responded to questions in the afternoon from a group of columnists and television news anchors, and later spoke to foreign policy and national security officials. **********In the last two days, Mr. Shultz and Mr. Poindexter have focused almost entirely on the summit. **********Mr. Shultz appeared today on the CBS Morning News, met the editorial board of The Washington Post, held a news conference this afternoon at the State Department and was interviewed by the Cable News Network. On Wednesday, Mr. Shultz flies to New York to meet with top editors of The New York Times. **********Mr. Poindexter, who rarely gives interviews, spent almost 80 minutes with reporters on Air Force One Sunday night, responding to questions as the President returned to Washington. On Monday, Mr. Poindexter held an extended news conference at the White House. **********On another matter, Mr. Poindexter denied today that the United States had started a campaign to mislead the press to weaken Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader.

It has become the leading dairy not only in Chicago, but also in other major markets around the United States, supplying milk sold under private labels at such grocery chains as Super Valu, Jewel and Kroger. It also is a major supplier of ice cream sold though about 425 Baskin-Robbins outlets. And, though not a household name, Dean Foods has become one of the most profitable companies in the food industry. **********''You can't point to just one thing,'' said Richard G. Elam, an analyst with Blunt Ellis & Loewi. ''They consistently make good acquisitions in important markets. They have conscientious management, plus the expertise. Put that all together, that spells success.'' **********Dean, based in Franklin Park, Ill., a Chicago suburb, has increased its profits 14 years in a row and sales have grown about 15 percent annually during that period. Its return on equity is 23.6 percent, according to analysts, putting it not far behind the food industry's perennial leader, the Kellogg Company. A No-Nonsense Company **********Dean knows that the key to success in commodity businesses - particularly in the dairy industry, which has been plagued by overcapacity and relatively flat consumption - is to hold down costs. A straightforward, no-nonsense company, it does this in a variety of ways. **********It stays close to the markets it serves, maintaining 26 dairies nationwide. It maintains its own fleet of 2,600 refrigerated trucks and makes its own plastic jug containers, which it finds cheaper than paper. It has automated the cleaning and maintenance of dairy equipment, a chore that once necessitated disconnecting every piece by hand every day. And in 1984, it extracted wage concessions from its Illinois workers to compete with nonunion dairies in Wisconsin. **********''They run dairies with less money than anybody else.'' said Arthur E. Lichtendorf, an analyst with E. F. Hutton. ''They pay attention to details, run a tight ship and don't waste money.'' **********But Dean's soaring earnings are based on more than belt-tightening. Dean has used its profits to finance a nationwide growth formula that has allowed it to acquire 17 other dairies since 1976. It has done only friendly deals, aiming for small, healthy concerns, paying cash, not stock. Half of Dean's growth - it projects 1985 earnings of $31.7 million on sales of $1.05 billion - has come from acquisitions. **********''They call on about 50 to 60 potential acquisition candidates every year, just to stay in touch, until they're ready to sell,'' said Martin A. McDevitt, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Company. 'They Tend to Forget You' **********''If you don't talk to a dairy all the way along, they tend to forget you and go with whoever is around,'' said Kenneth J. Douglas, 63 years old, the chairman and chief executive of Dean since 1970. A lawyer by training, Mr. Douglas was an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation before joining Dean in 1954. **********Once it has made an acquisition, Dean brings its cost-cutting expertise to bear. Money is provided for capital improvements, but that improvement becomes part of the division's asset base, and it is expected to show a higher return on its base. In addition, the division must file monthly reports and its officials must make a trip every two months to the company's Spartan headquarters for ''profit-planning reviews.'' **********Executives at the acquired companies say that the regimen requires some adjustment, but acknowledge that it pays off. ''I'm not joking when I say you have to run a tighter ship under Dean,'' said James Graham, vice president of sales and marketing for Gilt Edge Farms Inc., one of the dairies bought by Dean. ''They run the tightest one in the industry.'' A Pioneer With Cartons **********Dean has long been known for following its own path. In the 1930's, when most dairies sold milk in glass bottles and only through home delivery, for example, Dean packaged milk in paper containers and sold exclusively to grocery stores. **********Years later, that decision helped Dean to expand rapidly. ''When supermarket chains really got going in the 1950's,'' Mr. Douglas said, ''we had the distribution system they needed and they already knew us.'' **********While other food companies trumpet their names, Dean remains pleased to take a back seat to its customers, allowing supermarket chains and others to put their private labels on Dean's dairy products. **********''To serve a chain, I don't care which one, they want their own private label,'' Mr. Douglas said. ''If you don't give it to them, someone else will.'' No Advertising Expenses **********This approach serves Dean in another way. While other food companies spend large sums on advertising, Dean avoids most of those expenses. **********Dean added yet another major supermarket chain, Jewel Food, to its fold last April, when Hillfarm, the dairy that was Dean's biggest competitor in the Chicago market, closed after its contaminated milk led to more than 17,000 cases of salmonella. The Jewel deal helped raise Dean's profits by 24 percent last year, and now accounts for one-tenth of Dean's sales and profits, analysts say. ''The key is volume,'' said Mr. Douglas, whose company sold 375 million gallons of milk last year. **********In recent years, however, there have been obstacles to building volume. Price supports were increased dramatically under the Carter Administration, keeping milk prices artificially high, and soft drinks cut into milk volume. Only within the last year have prices been frozen. Cholesterol-conscious consumers also helped push milk consumption down in the 1970's, although the dairy industry has tried to counter that problem by promoting low-fat and skim milk. **********Today, Dean is trying to take advantage of the public's clamor for more calcium by developing a new calcium-fortified milk, to be marketed later this year. To date, only a handful have tried similar ventures, with no success, Mr. Douglas said. 'Willing to Bob and Weave' **********''We're a production- and processing-oriented kind of company,'' said Howard M. Dean, the 48-year-old president and grandson of Samuel E. Dean Sr., who founded the company in 1925. ''That's why we're willing to bob and weave to supply products.'' **********Dean also seems to be showing increasing interest in expanding beyond the dairy base that has served it so well, though it has remained in foods and not tried to move into other businesses. Last month it paid $165 million for the Larsen Company, a Milwaukee-based processor of frozen vegetables with sales of $170 million. Before that, roughly 20 percent of Dean's operations - and somewhat more of its earnings - came from nondairy foods, including pickles, dips and sauces. Its Peter Piper pickle is second in its industry, after Vlassic, a product of the Campbell Soup Company. The Larsen acquisition, however, marked its first move into nondairy frozen foods. **********Mr. Douglas said the Larsen acquisition was made to please its supermarket-chain customers. ''Our chain customers like suppliers with a large variety,'' he said. Not coincidentally, the acquisition allows Dean to take advantage of its refrigerated trucks and expertise with frozen food, gained through years of making ice cream. **********While Dean is busy seeking out acquisition prospects, Mr. Douglas says he is unperturbed about Dean itself becoming a takeover target. The Dean family owns about 26 percent of the outstanding stock, he said, and, at 19 times earnings, Dean's stock is costly. ''This is not the kind of underperforming company a raider wants,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/business/underwriting-activity-falls.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 205, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Underwriting Activity Falls", "print_headline": "Underwriting Activity Falls", "body_text": " **********Underwriting activity during the quarter ended yesterday remained intense but fell sharply from the torrid pace of the previous two quarters. **********A total of $58.46 billion in securities was issued in the American markets in the last three months, according to IDD Information Services. **********That represented a 59.5 percent jump from the $36.65 billion issued a year ago, but a significant decline from the record $75.9 billion issued in the second quarter and the $67.9 billion in the first quarter of 1986, IDD said. **********Salomon Brothers, with $8.5 billion of underwritings, retained its lead in the ranking of firms, followed by Morgan Stanley & Company, with $8.22 billion, and the First Boston Corporation, with $8.16 billion. **********Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was fourth over all, with $6.76 billion of underwritings, followed by Goldman, Sachs & Company, with $6.45 billion worth, IDD said. **********In the municipal securities market, total volume in the third quarter rose 57.4 percent, to $58.86 billion, from $37.4 billion the year before, according to the Securities Data Company.

Weinberger, who is leading a team here to discuss a six-year, $1.74 billion military assistance program for Pakistan. The aid would begin in 1988. **********A previous aid package, which ends this year, included 40 F-16 aircraft armed with AIM-91 air-to-air missiles.

''At the present time on the western border we are totally blind,'' General Zia told American reporters traveling with Mr. Weinberger. Fighter Planes Are Near India **********American oficials here said there were 500 raids across the border in the first six months of the year. Bombs, missiles or strafing guns were used in about 150 of the raids, they said. However, many of the other incidents may have involved planes accidentally straying across the border, the American officials added. **********Pakistan's fighters are based closer to its old foe, India, so they have a difficult time responding quickly to incursions from Afghanistan, military analysts said. New aircraft that would serve as airborne sentries are seen as a tremendous asset in such situations, multiplying the value of the F-16's. **********The best American plane for the purpose, the Boeing E-3A airborne warning and control system, or Awacs, is too expensive for Pakistan to buy, General Zia and American officials agreed. **********But Pakistan might be able to afford the Grumman E-2C Hawkeye, or a Lockheed P-3 Orion variant outfitted with a warning radar. The other possibilities, less costly and less effective, include a tethered balloon carrying radar or a series of radar sets deployed along mountain ridges. Other Weapons Are Sought **********None of these systems would be in service for a few years, though, which has prompted General Zia to contemplate an interim loan of aircraft. **********The airborne warning planes are considered the most important weapon system Pakistan is seeking. Other parts of the aid package would further improve artillery, antitank and air defense abilities, American officials said. **********General Zia's view of the Afghan situation correlates closely with Mr. Weinberger's own.

But they were far from clear about the overall impact of the bill's proposals on economic projections and the securities markets. **********''It's too early to tell what the industry would say if you put it to a vote,'' said Edward Fergus, a Prudential-Bache tax department executive who heads the Securities Industry Association's tax analysis committee. ''We will need a few days.'' **********The legislation backed by the Senate panel has two features that have sent shivers through the banks, brokerage houses, accountants and fund managers that make up the nation's professional investment community. **********First, capital gains on investments would be treated as regular income. That would raise to 27 percent, from 20 percent, the tax most investors would pay on the profits from the sale of stocks and bonds. **********Second, people covered by company pension plans would not be allowed to take tax deductions for investments in Individual Retirement Accounts. Effect on Investors **********The elimination of special treatment for capital gains could have a major effect on investment behavior, according to some experts. **********''People are going to be much less inclined to go into high-risk investments,'' said David T. Wright, national director of tax services for Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm. ''Entrepreneurs are going to have to give up a lot of their companies to attract investors if the taxes are the same no matter what the risk.'' **********However, it is not the venture capitalist, but the average I.R.A. saver, who is most in the spotlight as a result of the bill. **********''We don't know how much you curtail the incentive to save by eliminating the I.R.A. deduction, but it's very substantial,'' said Rab Bertlesen, vice president of Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based manager of $52 billion in funds. ''We received thousands of calls today about this from our customers.'' I.R.A. Incentives Would End **********The proposed legislation would end the tax incentives for saving in I.R.A.'s for 19.5 million households, or roughly 75 percent of those that have I.R.A. accounts, according to the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group representing more than 1,500 mutual funds that manage $580 billion. Savings in Individual Retirement Accounts have surged to $250 billion from $26 billion since the tax incentive took effect in 1982. **********Mutual funds, commercial banks and savings banks are expected to lobby heavily to save the current I.R.A. rules on the floor of the Senate. If they fail, they hope to preserve them when committee members from the Senate and the House, which included the deduction in its tax bill, meet to iron out their differences. **********''The Senate Finance bill deprives institutions of a good marketing tool to attract new savings, which deprives the country of something it needs,'' said Mark Clark, spokesman for the United States League of Savings Institutions, noting that Americans save less than one-third as much of their income as Japanese. **********Without the tax deduction, I.R.A.'s might not appeal to many investors because of the penalties for taking funds from the account before retirement. But some analysts question how much the tax change will actually diminish overall savings. **********''We don't see the I.R.A. change as very meaningful except that it will make tax-exempts, which have enjoyed substantial growth in recent years, more attractive,'' said Howard Stein, chairman and chief executive of the Dreyfus Corporation, which manages $35 billion in assets. Lift for Tax-Exempt Securities **********Indeed, the end of I.R.A. deductions and numerous tax shelters in the Senate committee's bill could provide a major boost to tax-exempt securities. Although the Senate panel's proposed reduction of the maximum individual tax rate to 27 percent, from 50 percent, would reduce the value of the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds, analysts pointed out that the value of those bonds would be enhanced by less favorable tax treatment of other tax-sheltered investments. **********''The Senate version is a wonderful improvement over the House bill,'' said Neal H. Attermann, manager of the municipal research department at Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********Mr. Atterman and officials at other firms were especially pleased that the Senate panel's legislation would not subject municipal bond interest to a minimum tax when the bondholders are wealthy individuals who pay a low tax rate. Under the House tax bill passed last December, wealthy individuals would face an alternative minimum tax on various tax-sheltered income, including interest from municipal bonds. **********Both the Senate and House versions of the tax-overhaul bill would reduce the amount and kind of bonds that local governments may issue in the tax-exempt bond market, but the reductions would be much less severe under the Senate version. For example, the Senate Finance Committee's version would allow 25 percent of each bond issue to be used for private, non-governmental puposes, compared with 10 percent under the House bill. The Senate panel's bill also eliminates a stringent volume cap for bond sales in each state, applicable to hospital and higher education bonds, and to the portion of general obligation bonds that was for the use of a private business or individual. **********According to economists at banks and securities firms, it could take Wall Street a long time to sort out the impact of the tax legislation. **********''The market will interpret it negatively at first, but it may not be so clear after reflection,'' said Steven Einhorn, an economist who follows equity markets for Goldman, Sachs. Mr. Einhorn noted, for instance, that the overall impact of the legislation might be to lower interest rates, which could provide a counterweight to any discouragement investors might feel about stocks and bonds as a result of the capital gains or I.R.A. provisions. **********For all their fears about the effect of the bill on their customers, Wall Street firms themselves are likely to come out ahead from the overall reduction in tax rates. Most have average tax bills higher than the 33 percent rate set in the legislation. **********Such calculations may yet prove to be academic, according to some observers who see a long road ahead for the legislation. **********''I still think the odds are only 50-50 that we will get a tax bill,'' said Marshall Front, senior partner at Stein Roe & Farnham, a Chicago-based investment management firm."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/02/business/the-markets-in-85-winners-and-losers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Markets in '85: Winners and Losers", "print_headline": "The Markets in '85: Winners and Losers", "body_text": " **********Strong earnings, lower interest rates and takeover bids fueled the stock market's top performers last year. **********But technology stocks fell from favor, a conspicuous exception to the market's broad and vigorous surge. **********An article begins on page D1, and a special report appears on pages D7 to D12, with full-year stock tables for the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National Market.

Shcharansky, the Soviet dissident whose imprisonment marred Soviet-American relations for nine years, met for 30 minutes with President Reagan today to discuss ways of pressing Moscow on human rights issues. **********The meeting came during a day of praise for Mr. Shcharansky's strength and integrity, and of thanks from him for the aid that Congress and the President had given to his cause. **********Before his arrest in Moscow, he was active in the Jewish emigration movement and in the Helsinki Watch Committee, which monitored rights violations. His arrest, on charges of treason, was part of an effort to crush the dissident movement by linking it with United States intelligence services. **********Capitol Hill Welcome **********Today, Mr. Shcharansky, who has taken the Hebrew first name Natan since his arrival in Israel, was welcomed to Capitol Hill, where he conferred with lawmakers and addressed a ceremony in his honor. **********Mr. Shcharansky entered the Capitol rotunda to a standing ovation from legislators and representatives of Jewish groups. He was flanked by Senator Robert J. Dole, the majority leader, and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Speaker of the House. **********Later, on emerging from the White House, Mr. Shcharansky said: ''We were speaking about the best ways of dealing with the Soviet Union, and I was surprised how deeply President Reagan understands that system.'' **********When asked whether he was encouraged by what Mr. Reagan had told him, Mr. Shcharansky said: ''Very much. Quiet diplomacy, from my point of view, can help only if it is supported by strong public pressure, strong public diplomacy.'' Praise for Reagan **********Later, at a news conference, Mr. Shcharansky praised Mr. Reagan. **********''This Administration deals much better with the Soviet Union than its predecessors,'' Mr. Shcharansky said. ''And I quite frankly told the President that in his hands is an historical opportunity, that the fate of 400,000 Soviet Jews to a great extent is in his hands. I am sure that he is the President who can reach success.'' **********Mr. Shcharansky was alluding to the number that Israel says want to emigrate. The Soviet Union contends that most of those among the nation's 1.7 million Jews who want to leave have done so by now. **********President Reagan's meeting with Mr. Shcharansky and a White House decision last month not to receive Yelena G. Bonner, the wife of Andrei D. Sakharov, has underscored new subtleties in the human rights strategy toward the Soviet Union. An Ambiguous Assessment **********In essence, American officials have come to the ambiguous assessment that official intervention can damage a dissident's situation as well as improve it. It is a cautious calculation endorsed by specialists on Soviet affairs but disputed by many of the dissidents themselves, who tend to favor strong displays of support. **********Beginning last fall - two months before the Geneva meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader -President Reagan shifted away from public criticism of Soviet practices and emphasized quiet diplomacy instead. **********Some common-sense guidelines have emerged. The current rule of thumb holds that Soviet gestures of good will should not be exploited. **********Thus, officials explain, the President should not take advantage of the Soviet decision to allow Miss Bonner to visit the United States for medical treatment by holding a meeting that could jeopardize her return - which she desires - or a possible improvement in the situation of her husband. **********A leading rights activist and physicist, Dr. Sakharov has been in exile in Gorky since 1980. American officials do not want to do anything to reduce the slim chance of his being allowed to return home to Moscow. Meeting Gets Little Publicity **********In the interest of what Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, today called ''the quiet diplomatic approach,'' Mr. Shcharansky's meeting with the President was given little public exposure. No pool of reporters or photographers was present; a White House photograph was released later. **********The shift in tactics reflects a general sobering from a decade ago. **********Some activists have now adopted a softer tone on the 1974 legislation that barred trade benefits for the Soviet Union as long as it did not allow freer emigration. At the height of emigration in the late 1970's, mostly by Jews, ethnic Germans and Armenians, Soviet officials said the exodus had not brought any American response. **********''We would support a Presidential decision to waive the restrictions under appropriate conditions,'' said Jerry Goodman, executive director of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, alluding to a possible surge in emigration."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/22/business/economic-scene-nobel-laureate-pierces-veil.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1986-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 822, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Nobel Laureate Pierces Veil", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Nobel Laureate Pierces Veil", "body_text": " **********THE awarding of this year's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science to Prof. James M. Buchanan of George Mason University will help break down the intellectual walls between economics and political science, and quite possibly the other social sciences as well. The result is likely to be greater institutional and psychological realism for economics and a more useful, logical structure for political and social science. And, beyond the realm of academia, the ultimate outcome could be better public policy. **********On the surface, there may seem to be nothing new about Professor Buchanan's view that politicians or bureaucrats who transact the public's business are commonly in pursuit of their personal interests. In the 16th century, Machiavelli's ''The Prince'' set forth rules of statecraft based on the seemingly cynical assumption that what a ruler really needed to know was how to preserve and extend power, whether or not it served the public interest or abstract principles of morality. **********In the 17th century, Thomas Hobbes, one of Dr. Buchanan's heroes, in his ''Leviathan,'' held that the aggressive and self-serving acts of people were ''natural,'' and could not be judged sinful until laws were created to forbid certain acts. A sovereign authority was needed to establish objective rules of right and wrong. And Adam Smith, whose ''Wealth of Nations'' was published in 1776, saw human behavior as naturally self-interested, whether in the private or public sphere, and retailed the countless follies of government and the corruption of individuals pretending to ''trade for the public good.'' He considered society to be better protected by the ''invisible hand'' of competitive and free markets, which restrained power, public or private, and transmuted self-interest into a public good. **********Professor Buchanan's economics embodies this skeptical tradition, but he has brought it to life by applying it to such contemporary problems as the public debt and government spending in a way that sheds new light on political behavior. He finds it difficult for the average citizen to pierce ''the veil of ignorance'' in which national economic policy-making is wrapped. **********Political entrepreneurs, in his view, have strong incentives to minimize the social costs of public expenditures and to exaggerate the potential gains. ''This fraud is accentuated by the short time horizons of the politicians as well as voters' ignorance,'' says one of Dr. Buchanan's leading students, Prof. Thomas E. Borcherding of the Claremont Graduate School. Dr. Buchanan sees politicians, much as did the late Prof. Joseph Schumpeter of Harvard, as routinely engaged in a vote-buying business, in political ''salesmanship,'' the essential aim of which in democratic societies is election and the retention or extension of power. **********One of the current outcomes of this process is the rapidly growing public debt. Dr. Buchanan, though he recognizes the short-run utility of Keynesian economics as a device for combating the business cycle, blames it for undermining the nation's fiscal discipline. In a book titled ''Democracy in Deficit,'' Dr. Buchanan and his co-author, Richard Wagner, contend that John Maynard Keynes deprived the nation of the idea - call it a myth or even an error - that balanced budgets were always good. In demonstrating that budget deficits were sometimes not merely unavoidable but even valuable for increasing total spending and reducing unemployment, Keynes opened the door for politicians to rationalize deficits under virtually any circumstances and for long stretches of time. **********As the politicians' case for the low social costs and high benefits of government spending helped lay the foundations for the swelling public debt, the unpopularity of raising taxes to eliminate budget deficits, which reached a zenith after President Reagan's defeat of Walter F. Mondale in 1984, seems to have completed the job of building high budget deficits into the American system. **********The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, a Hobbesian or Buchanan-style means of using ''sovereign power'' to force politicians to return to budget balance, appears to have failed. A constitutional amendment to balance the budget is still in the offing. The next immediate step under consideration by the Administration may be to redefine budget balance by creating a capital budget. Some economists consider such a move a dangerous way of disguising continuous deficits that could exacerbate the nation's savings shortfall, growing dependence on foreign capital, the trade deficit, the weak dollar, sluggish growth and, ultimately, its price stability. **********But cynicism about the motives of politicians, bureaucrats, special interests and the ignorance and selfishness of citizens may lead to hopelessness about the outlook for democracy. The foes of government spending and taxes may have hidden agendas, such as the redistribution of income toward themselves. No more than the proponents, the opponents of government cannot be assumed to be innocent of self-serving purposes. In his more recent writing, Dr. Buchanan allows for the possibility that some public decision-makers may be driven by some degree of public-spiritedness and moral concern. We shall examine this possibility in another column."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/14/business/car-price-increase-seen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Car Price Increase Seen", "print_headline": "Car Price Increase Seen", "body_text": " **********Japan's decision to keep a limit on auto exports will lead to higher car prices in the United States, but burgeoning Japanese production here may soon make such quotas irrelevant, industry analysts say. **********John Hammond of Data Resources Inc., estimated that prices of subcompact Japanese cars would rise by 10 percent and that American auto makers might follow with matching increases. **********In addition, Michael Bryan, analyst with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, estimated Japanese auto makers would be making 1.5 million vehicles a year in plants in the United States before the end of the decade, accounting for 10 percent of American sales."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/06/world/italian-company-role-in-star-wars-sought.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Italian Company Role In 'Star Wars' Sought", "print_headline": "Italian Company Role In 'Star Wars' Sought", "body_text": " **********Italy has decided to open talks with the United States on the participation of Italian corporations in research into developing a space-based defense against missiles, the Foreign Ministry said today. **********Italy is still undecided, however, about whether to join in deploying space weapons. **********In a statement, the ministry said Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti had told the visiting American Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Michael H.

Inside will be Sarah Ferguson, only moments away from becoming the bride of Queen Elizabeth II's second son, Prince Andrew, and thus the newest member of the unending serial of the Windsor family. **********''It is going to be the best day of my life,'' the future princess said in an exuberant radio interview on her last day as a commoner. ''Fantastic! The more the merrier - more carriages, more pomp. Wonderful! I love it.'' **********This evening crowds were already gathering along the route Miss Ferguson's coach will follow as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rode along it in the opposite direction to Buckingham Palace for her weekly private audience with the Queen. Alternate Attention-Grabber **********Among politicians, especially in Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party, this week's meeting excited almost as much interest as the wedding, for it was the first encounter between the Queen and the head of Her Majesty's Government since the appearance of a newspaper report citing ''sources close to the Queen'' as saying she was dismayed by Mrs. Thatcher's policies and confrontational manner. **********If the strict conventions governing such audiences were followed, as they almost certainly were, no one will find out for decades, if ever, how frankly or explicitly the two women discussed the purported leak or whether they talked about the question of sanctions against South Africa that appears to be isolating Britain within the Commonwealth group of nations. **********The original script for the week of Prince Andrew's wedding called for his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, to fly to the city of the same name the day after the ceremony at Westminster Abbey to open the Commonwealth Games on behalf of the Queen, who is titular head of the 49-nation grouping. **********But as of this evening, only 19 Commonwealth countries are sending teams. The remaining 30, accounting for seven-eighths of the Commonwealth's total population, will be boycotting the games to protest Mrs. Thatcher's adamant stand against sanctions. **********Sanctions and South Africa are likely to be far from everyone's mind by the time the glass coach, which was first used 75 years ago in the coronation of King George V, reaches Westminster Abbey with Miss Ferguson. Weightier Matters Prevail **********The obsessive coverage of the wedding preparations, filling special supplements in all the national newspapers, has revealed that the wedding band the Prince will slip on his bride's finger is made of gold from a nugget mined at Gwynedd in Wales. But this is not a signal that the royal family is boycotting South African precious metals. Gold from the same nugget, it seems, has been used for rings for all royal weddings since the present Queen Mother married the Duke of York, later King George VI, in 1923. **********This evening, the young couple were stars of a 50-minute television documentary called ''Andrew and Sarah'' that ran on two of the four television channels here. In an interview, the future Princess Andrew was pressed to say whether and how much she minded her loss of freedom and anonymity. **********She handled the question lightly, declining the role of victim. ''You can get hair appointments a lot easier and walk into restaurants,'' she replied. **********In the crescendo of prenuptial publicity, Miss Ferguson's dressmaker in Fulham became a superstar. There were also long press interviews with the Dorset farmer whose silkworms provided the silk for the wedding gown, the choirmaster at Westminister Abbey, a groom in the palace stables and a royal footman, not to mention a dairyman who delivered 300 pints of clotted cream to Buckingham Palace this afternoon for the strawberries at the wedding breakfast on Wednesday, which will actually be a lunch."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/12/business/briefs-471986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Ameritech Publishing Inc., Troy, Mich., said it had acquired a portion of American Telephone and Telegraph Co.'s overseas directory marketing business.

Analysts added that 4 percent economic growth, combined with low inflation would even help the bond market by raising Federal tax revenues and reducing the budget deficit. #2-Year Issues Steady While long-term bond prices were strong, prices for Treasury bills and notes due in two years or less were little changed. The overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market was about 8 percent, and some money market forecasters expect that the Federal Reserve might soon arrange temporary or permanent sales of short-term securities to drain reserves from the banking system and offset the large amount of reserves supplied as the Treasury's balance at the Federal Reserve declines sharply. **********Rates at the regular weekly auction of new Treasury bills rose slightly. The three-month issue sold at an average rate of 6.99 percent, up from 6.92 percent a week earlier, while the six-month issue averaged 7.06 percent, up from 7.03 percent. **********In advance of today's auction of $9 billion of new three-year Treasury notes, securities dealers offered the issue on a when-issued basis to yield 8.11 percent, down from 8.14 percent Friday. Demand from commercial banks is expected to be very strong, since business loan demands are sluggish, and they are no longer buying large amounts of tax-exempt securities as they were in the last months of 1985. **********The 10-year notes to be auctioned tomorrow were offered at 8.90 percent in the when-issued market, down from 9.04 percent Friday. **********Long-term bonds - the favorite vehicle for speculators around the world who want to bet on American interest rates - were offered late yesterday with a yield of 9.18 percent, down from 9.27 percent last Friday. **********Mr. Stone of Merrill Lynch estimated that Japanese demand at this week's auctions will be concentrated in the 30-year issue, and could total $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. He noted that the Japanese were more aggressive buyers of 20-year bonds sold in early January, before the yen began rising to its current level of about 191 to the dollar. **********Although the 5.57 percent yield on bellwether 6.2 percent 10-year Japanese Government bonds is low compared with the yield on Treasury issues, some Japanese investors may be deterred by the possiblity that the yen might strengthen further against the dollar. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of new three- and six- month Treasury bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures) #3-Mo.

They are operated by former high-ranking military officers and intelligence personnel, anti-Communist Cuban exiles and conservative American political groups concerned that America is yielding Central America to Communist control. **********The extent of the network emerged in interviews in recent days with Administration officials in Washington and with a number of people who took part in the supply effort in this country and in Latin America. 'Arm's Length' Relationship **********The groups include such organizations as the World Anti-Communist League, headed by John K. Singlaub, a retired Army major general; the Civilian Materiel Assistance group organized by an Alabama Special Forces veteran; and a Florida-based organization of elite former Air Force covert operations specialists known as the Air Commandos Association, headed by Harry Aderholt, a retired Air Force general. **********Contacts with this network have been handled with great delicacy by the Administration. Officials take pains even in private meetings to avoid admitting direct control. **********According to an account by Administration officials, aid supplied by these groups to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, has been discussed at White House meetings over the last few months. The participants expressed support of the effort, but spoke of it as being carried out by private individuals with an ''arm's length'' relationship with the Administration. 'Well-Established Tradition' **********The Administration, however, has expressed public support for such efforts. President Reagan called them a ''well-established tradition in our country'' in a remark in 1984 after a medical evacuation helicopter operated by a private aid group was shot down by the Sandinistas, much as the cargo plane was this month, killing its two American crewmen. **********He also said then that he would ''be inclined not to interfere with them.'' **********This month, after the private military supply flight carrying assault weapons to the contras was shot down, Mr. Reagan said the Administraton had ''been aware that there are private groups and private citizens that have been trying to help the contras.'' He likened the effort to the involvement of Americans in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade fighting Francisco Franco in Spain in the 1930's. Saudi Role Reported **********According to a new disclosure today, the network may have included nations not directly involved in the Central American conflict. An American businessman, who asked not to be named, said he had been asked to funnel Saudi Arabian funds to rebel forces in Nicaragua through other Americans, including retired Gen. Richard V. Secord, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense. **********He said the approach had been made by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States. He also said he had declined to take part. **********The businessman said he had been told that the involvement of Saudi Arabia stemmed from the United States agreement in 1981 to sell it Awacs radar intelligence planes. **********The agreement purportedly involved a pledge by the Saudis to provide financial aid to anti-Communist guerrilla groups favored by the United States, notably in Afghanistan and Angola, in exchange for the Awacs, the sale of which was bitterly opposed by both the Israelis and powerful groups in this country. A Denial by Saudis **********Prince Bandar bin Sultan declined to comment directly. The Saudi Embassy in Washington issued a statement denying any involvement, past or present, direct or indirect, in aiding groups ''concerned with Nicaragua.'' **********Efforts to reach General Secord by telephone were unsuccessful, but he has in the past, through his lawyer, denied any involvement in providing aid to the contras. **********The businessman, who has had extensive dealings with Saudi Arabia, said the request by the Saudi Ambassador to funnel the aid to the contras came after a meeting between King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and William C. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence, in February 1984. The businessman said that Mr. Casey and the King met privately aboard the royal yacht off the French Riviera to discuss the plan. **********A Central Intelligence Agency spokesman, Sharon Foster, denied the businessman's account. ''It is a false story,'' she said. The money that was being gathered was to be used to buy arms and other military equipment to supplement ''nonlethal'' aid being channeled to the contras by ostensibly private American groups operating with the public approval and tacit support of the White House. **********The fund-raising was part of a wide-ranging effort to finance the contras after Congress cut off direct and indirect support in 1983. Over the three years since then, private supply networks involving General Secord and others have helped keep the contra troops in the field. **********The account of the Saudi connection and the naming of General Secord add new information suggesting a pattern of Administration involvement in an extensive, ostensibly private, network of support for the contras. **********The participants in the White House meetings said there was no discussion of the legality of the aid efforts. They also said that there was no ''paper trail,'' such as memorandums or directives, linking White House officials to the effort, but that the meetings were infused with an understanding that the Administration approved. General Is Called a Contact **********Other sources have said that one of the White House's chief contacts in the network is General Singlaub. Besides his role as a fund-raiser for the operation - he has appeared on television talk shows and made numerous public appearances - General Singlaub has taken part in a Pentagon panel that plans counterinsurgency strategy. **********Another participant in that panel is General Aderholt, who operates a medical assistance operation in Florida staffed by the Air Commandos, an association of retired officers who flew covert operations in Southeast Asia in the 1960's. The medical aid, the general has said, goes to Guatemalan Indians and is entirely medical and nonlethal. **********The scope of private supply operations - lethal or not - came sharply into focus on Oct. 5 with the downing of the cargo plane over Nicaragua. According to the surviving crewman, Eugene Hasenfus, the plane was part of an effort to aid the contras that former military officers say would cost tens of millions of dollars annually. **********The source of the large sums of money has been something of a mystery. General Singlaub, for example, reports raising some $10 million to $12 million, hardly enough to finance the contras, and the myriad other groups report contributing much lesser amounts. One of the largest aid groups, Civilian Materiel Assistance in Alabama, says its aid consists entirely of food, clothing and medical supplies. **********One source appears to have been the Saudis. **********The businessman who said he had been approached by Prince Bandar bin Sultan reported being asked early in 1984 to channel funds to General Secord for ultimate use by the contras. **********At the time the reported arrangement with the Saudis was made in 1981, the chief beneficiaries were said to be rebels in Angola and anti-Soviet guerrilla forces in Afghanistan. **********The effort to provide Saudi aid to the contras, according to the source familiar with it, came later, about two years ago, when Administration fears of a leftist sweep through Central America were strong and Congressional resistance to continued United States aid to the rebels was most pronounced. Restrictions Are Circumvented **********The arrangement allowed the Saudis to obtain the Awacs despite the opposition and gave the Adminstration a way to finance covert operations well outside normal channels. This made it possible to circumvent Congressional restrictions on covert aid to Central America and also to provide an almost impenetrable method of providing funds, enhancing the Administration's ability to plausibly deny involvement. **********The management and financing of the contra support network involves a variety of corporations and bank accounts, with the ultimate source and control of the funds unclear. **********For example, Mr. Hasenfus told an American reporter in Nicaragua that starting last July a company called Corporate Air Services paid him for his work on behalf of the contras, depositing the money directly in his bank account in Wisconsin. Mr. Hasenfus said he did not know anything more about the company. **********Corporate Air Services Inc. was incorporated last July in Delaware, a state where many corporations are organized, including a number formerly controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency. One such company was Air America, for which Mr. Hasenfus used to work. Under Delaware law, a minimum amount of corporate information is available to the public. **********The records show that Corporate Air Services was set up by a company that specializes in organizing such corporations, the United States Corporation Company. No outside officers or directors for Corporate Air Services are listed on the papers, nor is there a location given for the company. The incorporator, Mary Trebona of the Corporation Company, declined to give information about Corporate Air Services. **********The incorporation papers do show that the company would be involved in the ''sale and leasing of aviation and other equipment.'' **********After the downing of the supply plane this month, some Administation officials said privately that the supply operation was a privately financed enterprise headed and directed by General Singlaub. General Singlaub denied any knowledge of the operation. Wider Involvement Indicated **********Meanwhile, the flight logs and other documents found on board the plane also pointed to wider involvement. The logs, for example, indicated that earlier flights in which the pilots were involved used American military bases. **********Other items found on board were provocative, but inconclusive. One of the dead pilots - it is unclear which -carried in his wallet the business card of an American official, P. J. Buechler. Mr. Buechler is the operations coordinator of the State Department's Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance Office, set up to provide nonlethal aid to the contras. **********Asked in a telephone interview here if he knew either of the pilots, Mr. Buechler said ''not intimately.'' How did it happen, then, that one of the pilots of a cargo plane carrying assault rifles to the Nicaraguan rebels was carrying his card? **********He had personally given it to one of the pilots, he said, in connection with ''a shipment of nonlethal aid sometime in 1986.'' **********Mr. Buechler said he had been instructed by the State Department not to discuss the matter further. **********Other Administration officials said Mr. Buechler's job involved making sure that the missions carried only humanitarian aid supplied by the United States and not ''private aid.'' **********Elliott Abrams, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, said in an interview recently that the Administration had scrupulously avoided co-mingling of ''benefactor supplies'' and humanitarian aid. He said the Administration had rejected a proposal to use excess space on the flights for privately financed aid. **********Congressional sources disclosed, however, that the Administration dropped the plan only after the Senate Intelligence Committee strongly protested it. **********Others involved in the aid network also strenuously deny involvement in providing arms or other strictly military supplies to the contras. **********Thomas Posey, for example, a former Marine corporal who formed Civilian Military Assistance - the name has since been changed to Civilian Materiel Assistance - with several other former enlisted men in Janurary of 1984, said in a telephone interview that his group had ''never moved a single weapon.'' **********But he conceded that he and others in his group had provided military advice - ''teaching them how to fly and all that'' - in the beginning, but said that was no longer the case. **********It was Mr. Posey's operation that first attracted attention to the private aid network, in September of 1984, when one of its helicopters was downed and its two crewmen killed on what was described as a medical evacuation mission in Nicaragua. **********Mr. Posey also said he had ''never talked with any Government officials about what we're doing, how we're doing it, or anything else, to our knowledge.'' CUBAN EXILE LINKED TO CONTRAS **********MIAMI, Oct. 21 (AP) - A Cuban exile who escaped from a Venezuelan prison where he was held for the 1976 bombing of a Cuban commercial airliner is apparently supplying rebels in Nicaragua, The Miami Herald reported today. **********Quoting unidentified sources, The Herald said the man identified by Eugene Hasenfus as Ramon Medina, who he said was one of two Cuban-Americans who helped direct contra supply operations, is actually Luis Posada Carriles. **********Mr. Posada, a Bay of Pigs veteran, had bribed his way out of a high-security Venezuelan prison in August 1985.

But underlying issues, arousing strong feelings among religious, labor and business groups, remain to hound politicians. **********At immediate issue was the disposition of 4,000 cases pending in Ontario courts against retailers who have chosen to defy the Sunday closing law. But political analysts have cast the matter against a backdrop of a nation adjusting, sometimes reluctantly, to its own evolution from an inherently conservative and Christian society to something more complex. **********The court ruling, on a 6-to-1 vote, upheld Ontario's Retail Business Holidays Act, which sets fines of up to $10,000 for nonexempt stores that open Sundays. Until this year there were only scattered cases of defiance. But the issue came to a head when supermarkets and larger retailers began testing the law this summer, encouraged by opinion polls that showed large support for Sunday openings. #200 Tickets in Toronto With the police handing out as many as 200 tickets in Toronto one weekend earlier this month, intense interest focused on the Supreme Court, which had before it four 1983 cases involving retailers. Since only Alberta and British Columbia among Canada's 10 provinces have relaxed tight Sunday shopping restrictions, leaving the issue to localities, the fate of the Toronto cases have broader implications. **********In favor of keeping most stores closed were the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches, powerful voices in politics here, as well as organized labor groups, which saw the issue as a contest between the corporate drive for profits and the retail clerks' right to Sundays off. The big chains joined non-Christian religious groups, including the Canadian Jewish Congress, in opposing mandatory closing. **********Since the court's ruling turned on the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms, entrenched in the constitution by former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, more hinged on the outcome than Sunday closing. The charter contains provisions that many people believe will recast the political landscape, requiring more consideration for interests outside the traditionally dominant social and religious groups. A Toronto Delicatessen **********The charter's relevance to retailing was most evident in the case of Nortown Foods Ltd., a Jewish-owned meat market and delicatessen in Toronto, which argued that the requirement to close on Sunday was discriminatory under the charter provision guaranteeing freedom of religion. The Nortown stores close for the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday and contended that closing on Sunday imposed an unfair hardship. **********Five of the six Supreme Court judges agreed that the Ontario law abridged religious freedom, but they found this was ''reasonable and demonstrably justified'' under another charter provision allowing the curtailment of rights in face of competing social concerns. **********The concern cited by the Chief Justice, Brian Dickson, was the secular one of guaranteeing retail clerks a ''pause day'' each week on the same day as most other workers. **********The Chief Justice said in his ruling: ''A family visit to an uncle or a grandmother, the attendance of a parent at a child's sports tournament, a picnic, a swim or a hike in the park on a summer day, or a family expedition to a zoo, circus or exhibition - these, and hundreds of other leisure activities with family and friends are the most profound joys that any of us can know.'' One Dissenting Judge **********The only judge to dissent, Bertha Wilson, was born in Scotland and belongs to the Protestant majority that has moulded the social landscape here. Ms. Wilson rejected the Ontario Government's argument that it has accommodated Jewish and other non-Christian groups by allowing Sunday opening to retailers who observe the Saturday Sabbath so long as they have no more than seven employees. **********The effect of allowing small non-Christian shops to open and penalizing others, Ms. Wilson said, ''is that the religious freedom of some is respected by the legislation, while the religious freedom of others continues to be violated.'' **********She argued that such discrimination was exactly what the charter's framers had in mind when they specified, in another section, that Canadian laws should be drawn ''in a manner consistent with the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of Canadians.'' **********While bishops and labor leaders applauded the court's decision, Ontario prepared to go ahead with its backlog of prosecutions, including at least 165 charges against Paul Magder, a Toronto furrier who has attracted wide publicity by defying the law. Tightening of Enforcement **********Enforcement will be tightened with new fines for employers pressuring clerks to work on Sundays and by injunctions against repeat offenders. David Peterson, the Ontario Premier, said revisions to the law might be necessary to remove some anomalies -pornographic books can be sold in outlets that are licensed to open for entertainment purposes on Sundays, while mainstream bookstores must stay closed. **********This disappointed The Globe and Mail, a Toronto newspaper, which said that ''an increasingly restive public'' would eventually force repeal. Other critics went further. **********''It is a sad day in the history of Canada,'' said Jag Bhadauria, executive director of the Canadian Council for Racial Harmony. ''The court's decision is unjust and unfair because it fails to recognize the presence of other religious groups beside the Christian majority.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/25/business/market-place-weaker-dollar-helping-profits.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1986-03-25", "snippet": "WITH the dollar's drop against foreign currencies - about 30 percent from its peak in February 1985 to the end of the year and an additional 7 percent in the first quarter of 1986 -some stocks should carry a double punch.\n\nCompanies anticipating s...", "word_count": 811, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MARKET PLACE;\nWEAKER DOLLAR HELPING PROFITS", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE;\nWEAKER DOLLAR HELPING PROFITS", "body_text": " **********WITH the dollar's drop against foreign currencies - about 30 percent from its peak in February 1985 to the end of the year and an additional 7 percent in the first quarter of 1986 -some stocks should carry a double punch. **********Companies anticipating strong earnings increases, analysts say, should realize even better gains as revenues from their overseas sales are translated into American dollars. **********''A decline in the relative value of the dollar makes American products more competitive in world markets and foreign goods more expensive to the U.S. consumer,'' said Harold A. Mackinney, head of the investment policy committee of the Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I. ''Our multinational companies benefit most from this strategy.'' **********Assuming the general view that the dollar will decline a total of 10 percent in 1986 in relation to a ''market basket'' of other currencies, Mr. Mackinney has selected three stocks he believes have strong growth potential. **********''About 40 percent of the Millipore Corporation's sales come from overseas,'' Mr. Mackinney said of the filtration-equipment maker. ''The company earned $2.30 a share in 1985, and $2.80 a share for 1986 is a consensus estimate. A 10 percent decline in the dollar would add 30 cents to the earnings-per-share estimate.'' **********He said the International Business Machines Corporation realized 43 percent of revenues and 47 percent of earnings from foreign operations in 1985. ''Our estimate of $12.50 a share in 1986 includes between 50 and 75 cents a share as a currency benefit,'' Mr. Mackinney said. **********Pfizer Inc. is another company that should benefit, Mr. Mackinnney said. Pfizer derives 42 percent of sales and 34 percent of earnings from foreign activities. It is one of the most sensitive of the major drug companies to a 10 percent decline in the dollar with a benefit of 30 cents a share built into a 1986 estimate of $4 a share, up from $3.44 a share in 1985. **********''Those companies with a high percentage of overseas earnings already are benefiting,'' said Keith Harris, managing director of Morgan Grenfell U.S., a subsidiary of the London-based investment house. ''These include drug, computer and true multinationals that happen to be based in the United States.'' **********Mr. Harris continued: ''Least appreciated by many analysts are those companies that are major exporters such as manufacturers of heavy equipment like the Caterpillar Tractor Company and Deere & Company. Their fortunes typically will improve with a lag after the favorable change in currency rates.'' **********Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles, thinks the dollar will drift only a bit lower in 1986. **********''I would be inclined to invest in stocks that already reflect the weaker dollar and those that have a good balance between foreign sales and domestic sales,'' Mr. Peroni said. He said he finds these four categories of equities particularly attractive: *********** Health care, because of its strong exposure in foreign markets and name brand recognition. This would include the Gillette Company and the Warner-Lambert Company. *********** Packaged foods, especially R. J. Reynolds Industries, because of its recent acquisition of Nabisco and strong standing in packaged tobacco products. *********** Information systems, especially companies that offer proprietary systems with competitive positions that will be enhanced by the softer dollar. This category would include the Bell & Howell Company and the Sperry Corporation. *********** Optical/photographic companies, especially Baush & Lomb Inc. and the Eastman Kodak Company, because of their strong presence in international markets. **********Jay Harris, a principal in the investment advisory firm of Goldsmith & Harris, likes the Loctite Corporation, a manufacturer of industrial and consumer adhesives, which derives about 45 percent of its sales from Europe. He is also recommending the Ferro Corporation, the Lubrizol Corporation and Millipore. **********Mr. Harris believes Loctite's earnings per share will hit $2.50 by the end of its fiscal year ending June 30, up from $2.24 a share in the prior year, and climb to $3.50 a share by the end of the fiscal year 1987. Loctite shares closed at $40.25 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, up $1.50. **********Walter Wulkan, economic strategist for the Grunthal Financial Corporation, believes most industrial groups have already been exploited from an equity-appreciation standpoint but believes there is room for further price appreciation possibilities in issues such as the Colgate-Palmolive Company, the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and Pfizer. **********Mr. Wulkan sees Firestone going from its present $26 a share to $32 a share over the near term. He thinks Pfizer, now $58.75 a share, could go to $65 a share. And he believes Colgate-Palmolive, which closed yesterday at $38.50 a share, could reach $45 a share."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/05/business/finance-new-issues-j-p-morgan-sells-7.1-notes-at-par.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "J.

Since then, it has been mostly downhill; shares were about $10 last week. **********One reason: more competition. As Gear tilts toward the athletic market, it faces competition from newcomers such as Avia and from established companies such as New Balance and Nike. And its more fashion-conscious shoes go up against offerings from U.S. Shoe and the Cherokee Group. **********But a good part of the reason is the continuing strength of Reebok, which continues to hold onto a commanding 80 to 90 percent of the $260 million market for aerobic and fitness shoes. The company markets a popular court shoe, has introduced a running shoe and a basketball shoe, and recently paid about $120 million for Rockport Inc., a leader in walking shoes. **********''Reebok just seems to do everything right,'' said Jonathan H. Ziegler, an analyst at Sutro & Company in San Francisco, which handled Gear's initial offering. He attributes the dip in Gear's stock to a general decline in other shoemakers (Reebok is down to $28 from a high of $35 in June); to slower sales that can be traced to widespread discounting of Reeboks, and to the delay in a new advertising campaign. One plus for Gear, according to Mr. Ziegler, is its experience in dealing with the factories in the Far East that make most of these shoes. **********''I like to say that the business is one-third product, one-third distribution and one-third marketing,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/23/business/advertising-feminine-touch-for-ad-agency.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 679, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Feminine Touch for Ad Agency", "print_headline": "Advertising; Feminine Touch for Ad Agency", "body_text": " **********WHEN they were getting together the press kit that would announce their new ad agency, the folks behind Lotas Minard Patton McIver Inc. figured out that so far in their careers in the big time they have made advertising for at least 150 different products and services. **********''We've done everything from chain belts to chain saws,'' one said, bragging a bit.

The former was an executive vice president, executive creative director at SSC&B. Miss Patton, the member of the firm without an agency background, has, however, been in communications - public relations, marketing, new products direct marketing. For the last six years she has been a partner in Levinger & Patton, which supplies many of the communications servises needed by companies in the beauty field.

And real estate syndicators foresee a sharp decline in investments if restrictions on tax benefits from paper losses go into effect. That, they say, could affect the nation's housing stock. **********But not everyone who would seem to be threatened is complaining. While a number of venture capitalists say the changes would limit new investments, for example, others contend that their industry would be bolstered by ''winnowing out'' ill-conceived projects. **********And the consumer finance industry said it was not too worried about proposed cutbacks on interest deductions for consumer loans because, industry officials said, deductions are not a prime consideration in most borrowing decisions. **********In any event, spokesmen for the special-interest groups noted that the tax proposal is not yet law and many changes could be made that would affect its ultimate impact: **********REAL ESTATE EXPERTS said yesterday that the tax legislation passed by the Senate Finance Committee would have a destructive effect on the nation's housing stock, and would discourage investors from putting their money into real estate deals. **********Many deals are already falling through, they said, even though the legislation is far from enactment. **********''One of our clients just pulled two deals,'' said Peter Fass, head of the real estate syndication department at Carro Spanbock Fass Geller Kaster & Cuiffo, a New York law firm. ''And almost everything is being put on hold. This is going to affect every piece of real estate in America. They're taking away the tax benefits, legitimate tax benefits, that gave rich people the incentive to invest in things like subsidized housing that the nation really needs. You know what's going to happen? My clients are just going to walk away from subsidized housing and leave Congress to pick up the pieces.'' **********Another likely effect of the Senate proposal, the experts said, would be to change the nature of most real estate limited partnerships, so that instead of generating huge tax losses in the early years, the deals will be structured to produce losses just large enough to shelter the cash income the property produces. **********''The only deals that will be attractive are those that are economically oriented, because the tax benefits are largely being removed,'' said Paul Liles, a New York syndicator. ''You can't look at this in a vacuum. If the tax benefits of real estate are diminished, it only remains an attractive investment to the extent that prices fall or returns are increased. And those changes have a major effect on the economy.'' **********Several syndicators were especially unhappy about what they said were retroactive changes that take away benefits that existed when they put their money into real estate deals. 'The Most Unfair Thing' **********''I bought a deal last year, that projected losses for three years, and income beginning in six years,'' Mr. Fass said. ''Now they're changing the rules in the middle of the game, saying that you can't use the tax benefits you were counting on when you bought into a deal. The retroactive nature of this is the most unfair thing I've heard of.'' **********The dramatic reduction in tax rates proposed by the Senate committee would also lessen the tax advantages of home ownership, in some cases equalizing the after-tax results of renting and buying. Even though interest on mortgages and real estate taxes would continue to be deductible, the value of those deductions would be cut nearly in half for millions of high-income home owners. **********''A New Yorker who owns a condominium and is in a 50 percent tax bracket has to pay only $500 after taxes for each $1,000 in interest on his mortgage,'' said Orin S. Kramer, a New York consultant. ''Under the Senate proposal, his after-tax costs would rise to $730 for each $1,000 in interest. That increase in carrying costs for a mortgage will make a lot of people think twice before they commit to buying a place to live.'' **********Among those who have changed their plans to buy a home is Mr. Kramer himself: ''I was expecting to sign a contract this week on a condominium, but I think I'll just wait a few months and see what happens.'' **********Many experts said other portions of the Senate tax proposal would likely change the way investors think about real estate. For example, they said, the proposed elimination of the advantageous treatment of long-term capital gains may well spur faster trading of real estate-based investments such as limited partnerships. **********Under current law, people pay taxes on only 40 percent of their long-term capital gains, that is, gains on investments held for more than six months. That would result in a maximum tax on capital gains of 20 percent. But under the Senate proposal, such gains would be taxed as ordinary income to individuals. **********''I think we're going to see much more of a trader's mentality with respect to real estate,'' said A. George Kallop, head of the realty investment group at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.

Mortgage specialists said that if Congress did not act within weeks, the suspension could reduce the number of available Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration home mortgages offered by thrift institutions and mortgage bankers, and, in time, could result in higher rates on F.H.A. and V.A. mortgages, industry and Government officials said today. **********''It couldn't happen at a worse time,'' said Peter Knight, vice president for mortgage finance at the National Council of Savings Institutions. ''There are so many people seeking mortgages out there, if Congress does not step in quickly, you could have a lot of people unable to find a mortgage.'' **********As interest rates have fallen in recent months, the demand for new and refinanced mortgages has surged. Rise in Commitment Asked **********''The level of business we have seen in the last few months has been unprecedented,'' Glenn R. Wilson Jr., president of Ginnie Mae, said in a telephone interview. He added that Ginnie Mae had asked Congress to increase its commitment ceiling to $87 billion a year, from the current level of $65.3 billion. **********Mr. Wilson said the Administration hoped to have Congress include in such legislation, which the lawmakers are expected to approve, provisions embodying earlier proposals to narrow eligibility for mortgages that carry a Ginnie Mae guarantee. **********Earlier in the year, the Veterans Administration had to suspend its loan guarantee program when commitments reached budgeted limits. That program guarantees payment on the individual mortgage to the originator of the mortgage. Within weeks, Congress granted the V.A. greater authority. **********But according to Warren Lasko of the Mortgage Bankers Association, ''Ginnie Mae doesn't have the constituency of the Veterans Administration, and we expect some difficulty on Capitol Hill.'' **********Mr. Wilson said that demand for Ginnie Mae commitments had been so high since last fall that they were getting dangerously close to the ceiling. Thus, he said, all requests for commitments received by the agency after the close of business on April 4 would not be granted. **********Mr. Wilson said that he and Samuel R. Pierce Jr., Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, had ''put in process a request for additional authority.'' He said such approval could take several weeks. ''If we don't get a higher ceiling authority by June, that could begin to affect the market,'' he said. **********Ginnie Mae, established by Congress in 1970, guarantees the interest and principal payments on almost $250 billion in mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage originators generally buy a commitment from Ginnie Mae to guarantee a security, then make V.A. or F.H.A. mortgage loans to home buyers, package those loans in the form of securities and sell the securities in the secondary market. The interest and principal payments on the individual mortgages are passed through directly to the investors, and Ginnie Mae guarantees those payments. **********Since V.A. and F.H.A. mortgages are fixed-rate loans, thrift institutions and mortgage bankers generally do not offer such loans to home buyers unless they already have a Ginnie Mae commitment, which in turn usually insures sale in the secondary mortgage market. And since Ginnie Mae guarantees more than 90 percent of all V.A. and F.H.A. mortgages sold in the secondary market, any halt in its guarantees can dry up the availability of these mortgages, experts say. **********However, in recent months, mortgage bankers have been buying extraordinarily high volumes of commitments from Ginnie Mae in anticipation of a depletion of its available authority so that experts say a backlog exists that should last at least into next month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/17/business/bankamerica-posts-quarterly-profit.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1986-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANKAMERICA POSTS QUARTERLY PROFIT", "print_headline": "BANKAMERICA POSTS QUARTERLY PROFIT", "body_text": " **********The BankAmerica Corporation said yesterday that it had returned to profitability for the first time since the first quarter of 1985. **********BankAmerica, which has been reeling from serious loan problems at its main subsidiary, the Bank of America, said it earned $63 million, or 31 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31. While the earnings were 44.7 percent below the $114 million, or 63 cents a share, that BankAmerica reported in last year's first quarter, security analysts were heartened by the fact that BankAmerica was no longer running a gaping deficit. **********In 1985's fourth quarter, BankAmerica lost $178 million.

Rise in Nonperforming Assets **********On the other hand, Mr. Alpert and other Wall Street professionals cautioned against reaching an overlypositive conclusion from yesterday's report. They noted that BankAmerica's nonperforming assets - consisting of loans not accruing interest, restructured loans and repossessed real estate - rose to $4.3 billion, from $3.9 billion on March 31, 1985. Also, BankAmerica's provision for loan losses, reflecting management's assessment of loan problems down the road, rose 25 percent from the figure a year earlier, to $262 million. **********''I don't think their problems are behind them, but I do think they have made progress,'' said Stephen Berman, the BankAmerica analyst at Nomura Securities International. **********For its part, BankAmerica, the nation's second-largest banking company, attributed its improved results to a significant reduction in loan losses and to positive results from its cost-containment program. For example, the $262 million provision for loan losses was less than half of BankAmerica's fourth-quarter 1985 provision. **********In terms of expenses, outlays for salaries rose a modest 4.8 percent from levels a year earlier.

According to Peter Wright, another former agent and the author of the book that provoked the British suit in Australia, Lord Rothschild arranged in 1980 for the publication in Britain of an earlier book containing many of the same allegations that Mr. Wright has reassembled in his unpublished work called ''Spycatcher.'' **********The earlier book, ''Their Trade Is Treachery'' by Chapman Pincher, first laid out Mr. Wright's contention that a former M.I.5 director, Sir Roger Hollis, had been a Soviet ''mole.'' In the New South Wales Supreme Court - where Britain's highest-ranking civil servant, Sir Robert Armstrong, has been undergoing relentless cross-examination for seven days - Mr. Wright's lawyer has contended that the failure of the Thatcher Government to block publication of the Pincher book invalidates its claims that publication of the Wright book would harm national security. Drawing the Line **********Sir Robert on the witness stand in Sydney and Mrs. Thatcher in the House of Commons here have both contended that the vital difference between the two cases was that Mr. Pincher was a journalist while Mr. Wright was an official owing what the Prime Minister called ''a lifelong service of confidentiality to the Crown.'' **********But the distinction between the two cases started to blur on Monday when The Times of London reported that Mr. Wright, who had long been presumed to be Mr. Pincher's main source, had received half the royalties for the journalist's book. It blurred even further when Mr. Wright then issued a statement in Australia disclosing that it was Lord Rothschild who had suggested that what he had to say about the Hollis affair could best be said in a book. **********In Mr. Wright's account, Lord Rothschild's approach ''came totally out of the blue.'' The former agent, who by then was living in Australia, said he was sent a first-class air ticket and invited to come to London for a talk. It was Lord Rothschild, he said, who introduced him to Mr. Pincher and made the arrangements for payments through a Swiss bank account. **********''I knew Lord Rothschild to be an intimate confidant of successive heads of British intelligence establishments,'' his statement said. ''I could not conceive of him embarking on such a project without knowing it had the sanction, albeit unofficial, of the authorities. I sensed I was being drawn into an authorized, but deniable operation.'' Charges Are Denied **********After Mr. Pincher's book appeared in 1981, Mrs. Thatcher assured the House of Commons that the allegations against Sir Roger Hollis - who by then had been dead for seven years - had been thoroughly investigated and found to be baseless. Mr. Wright, who apparently concluded that he had been manipulated into taking part in an orchestrated disclosure designed to forestall further inquiries concerning Soviet penetration of the British service, has been striving ever since to reopen the case. **********Dale Campbell-Savours, a Labor member of the House of Commons, seized on his statement to file a formal question asking whether Lord Rothschild would now be prosecuted. Already last week, in order to demonstrate the consistency of its stand in the Australian court, the Government had to announce that it was investigating disclosures of other secret information by former intelligence officials. **********The Government's stand has provoked considerable ridicule here. ''What do we have, to be brutal, that is genuinely worth suppressing?'' asked Edward Pearce, a commentator in The Sunday Telegraph. ''The head of Government and the head of the Civil Service are pretending to each other and to the world that we are a very important country with secrets of world significance clutched to our bosom.

Companies that fit this pattern, she said, include Dow Jones, Teledyne, Dreyfus, Loews and some of the family-dominated retailing chains. Now the income of individuals, including stock dividends, will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28 percent. **********The proposed change in the tax code - together with the increased investor appetite for high yielding stocks - might provide a compelling incentive for these companies to begin paying dividends, or increase low ones, Ms. Byrne noted. ''I would expect that over three to five years that will change,'' she said. **********Should this indeed happen, these companies, which have been considered traditional growth stocks, would become additionally attractive to a second group of investors - the value managers. These managers typically seek securities based on their dividend-paying abilities. And interest by this different group of investors could drive the securities prices even higher, Ms. Byrne said. **********Other money managers believe that the tax proposal will favor those companies already benefiting from lower interest rates, such as thrift institutions, insurance companies and retailers, and hurt the companies already suffering, such as the heavy industrial companies: the aluminums, steels and chemicals. **********Financial companies and retailers will pay much lower taxes under the new proposals, which lower the corporate tax rate; the capital-intensive industrial companies, on the other hand, are expected to pay higher taxes, mostly because of changes in the depreciation allowances and the cancellation of the investment tax credit. **********''The strong get stronger and the weak go down for the count,'' said Steven A. Kroll, executive vice president of E. F. Hutton & Company. **********Another sector that could benefit under the new tax code are the brokerage stocks. Some experts think short-term trading will pick up, as investors - no longer concerned with getting favored capital gains treatment - take quick profits and turn over their portfolios more often. The additional brokerage commissions are likely to push up revenue and profits for a Merrill Lynch or an E. F. Hutton. **********Many on Wall Street were worried that the widely anticipated change in the capital gains tax would put downward pressure on stock prices. But many professionals doubt that huge numbers of individuals will rush to their phones and call their brokers to dump shares before the law goes into effect next year. Indeed, the recent stock rally would seem to indicate the opposite. **********Still, many money managers say investors who have big profits should unload stocks before the end of the year, to take advantage of a lower capital gains rate. ''Everybody should sell almost everything they have a big gain on this year,'' said Byron R. Wien, strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. **********But tax-related selling is not for everyone. There are obvious exceptions. Investors should not sell stocks they think could go up sharply - those that are capable of doubling or tripling in value, for instance. ''In this case paying the tax up front does not pay off,'' said Florence Fearrington, president of the $65 million New York investment management firm bearing her name. **********There are other possible reasons for not selling stock now, of course. For example, older individuals who have held securities for years and have a low-cost basis for tax purposes - and who probably plan to pass their holdings on to their estate -should not sell their investments this year. **********But what will probably keep most people from selling their stock is the prospect of having to pay any taxes. Most individuals hate to pay taxes and will probably defer them as long as possible, even if such a delay means they will pay more later."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/11/business/finance-new-issues-fannie-mae-offers-a-mortgage-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fannie Mae Offers A Mortgage Issue", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Fannie Mae Offers A Mortgage Issue", "body_text": " **********The Federal National Mortgage Association sold $310 million of 6 percent mortgage-backed securities yesterday at an average price of 93 20/32 to yield 7.56 percent.

'Qualitative Change' Noted **********There was deep concern over public perceptions in West Germany that the Reagan Administration had acted to put pressure on the contras to release the prisoners only after it sensed that failure to do so might adversely affect impending discussion of the contra aid bill by Congress. **********Indeed, leftist groups said the capture of the West Germans on May 17 represented a ''qualitative change,'' with the possible approval of the Reagan Administration, in the contras' policy toward foreign volunteer helpers of the Sandinistas. **********Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Nicaragua Information Office, a loose federation of church-related and political groupings that sent the volunteers to Nicaragua, denied assertions by rebel representatives that the West Germans had been armed and wearing Sandinista military uniforms when they were seized. These assertions were repeated Tuesday by the State Department. **********The spokesman said the office would disregard West German Government warnings and continue to send volunteers to help the Sandinista Government in regions of Nicaragua affected by the war against the insurgents. Opposition Denounces Reagan **********Publicly, Government officials sought to play down any irritation at Mr. Reagan's remarks. A spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Friedhelm Ost, said Mr. Kohl, in a Cabinet meeting this morning, ''thanked the American President'' for his help in obtaining the safe release of the eight. **********But officials voiced considerable dismay at the way in which the fate of the prisoners was drawn into the domestic battle over the Nicaraguan aid package. Irritation at the perceived disregard of German interests was all the greater since it comes at a time of deteriorating European relations with the United States over a range of important issues, from arms control to the struggle against terrorism. **********Opposition leaders denounced Mr. Reagan publicly. Karsten Voigt, a foreign affairs spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, said, ''Imagine if in the midst of the Achille Lauro affair the German Chancellor had called for an aid bill for Qaddafi.'' **********The reference was to the hijacking by Palestinian activists last fall of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro with numerous American tourists aboard. Washington accused the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, of backing the hijackers, who killed one of the Americans. **********''The timing was bad, and it was also symptomatic of a way of thinking,'' Mr. Voigt said. ''It reflects a double standard.'' Blockage of Aid Sought **********Legislators like Mr. Voigt said they thought pressure on Congress, which culminated Tuesday in an unusual appeal by West German parliamentary leaders, had helped obtain the Germans' release. Though the public appeal omitted any mention of the aid bill, Mr. Voigt said some German lawmakers privately urged members of Congress to block aid to the contras until the prisoners were released. **********Government officials appeared to assume, though they said they had no specific evidence, that the link with the aid package had prompted the Administration to press the contras into agreeing to the release. Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher, asked at a news conference whether he thought there was a link between discussions over the aid bill and the release, replied, ''That cannot be entirely excluded.'' **********He added, ''What was important for us was that the American Administration, as we perceived it, gave assistance to the extent of its possibilities.'' **********The view that there was some form of linkage was supported, officials said, by the suddenness with which representatives of the contras announced their willingness to let the prisoners go after having made their release contingent for weeks on numerous complicated conditions. **********Close aides of Mr. Genscher said their representative in Tegucigalpa was discussing several ways of transferring the prisoners, including a plan to use helicopters to drop them in a remote jungle area, when representatives of the contras unexpectedly announced that the captives would be handed over late Tuesday. Left's Role Is Debated **********Although Mr. Genscher stressed the continuous contacts German negotiators had had with American officials, he was unable to respond when asked how, specifically, Washington had helped in the release. **********''I have not been informed in exactly what manner this occurred,'' he said. **********At the same time, the seizure and release of the eight has provoked bitter debate over the role of leftist organizations that plan the sending of youthful volunteers to Nicaragua. **********At his news conference, Mr. Genscher appealed to such groups, some of which are backed by church bodies and leftist political parties, not to send workers ''under any circumstances to areas where civil war is raging.'' **********Political groups on the left denounced the appeal and called on the Government to work instead to cut off aid to the contras. The small opposition Green Party, in a statement, pledged to ''continue to support every sort of aid to Nicaragua, including the work brigades.'' #1,000 Volunteers Sent That is the term used to describe workers sent to various volunteer projects in Nicaragua. Though there are no reliable statistics, it is believed that West German volunteers form the second largest such group, after volunteers from the United States. **********Barbara Lucas, a spokesman for the Nicaragua Information Office in the West German town of Wuppertal, said it was the first time the contras had ''directly'' attacked any of the roughly 1,000 volunteers the office had sent to Nicaragua since it began organizing such trips in 1983. **********She said the office, which is financed by private donations, but also by funds from the Protestant church and the Green Party, coordinates the work of about 250 groups throughout Germany that seek to help the Nicaraguans. **********Last year, she said, two women sent as volunteers were pulled from a bus in Pantasma, in northern Nicaragua, by men assumed to be contras. She said the women were held for two days, raped and let go with a warning not to remain in the country. **********''It is a qualitative change in the tactics of the contras toward the development workers,'' she said. **********She said the office had been assured by four of the volunteers who succeeded in escaping from their captors that the Germans had not been armed, as representatives of the contras asserted. **********She said the office would disregard the Government appeal and continue sending workers into combat areas, though ''under changed conditions.'' **********''We will seek greater publicity for our people,'' she said, in the hope that greater visibility will shield them from harm, ''and in preparing them we will point out more clearly the high risk. And we will discuss with the Sandinistas whether they should continue working in endangered areas.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/08/business/a-bonanza-in-pennzoil-stock-and-options-soar.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1986-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 795, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A BONANZA IN PENNZOIL: STOCK AND OPTIONS SOAR", "print_headline": "A BONANZA IN PENNZOIL: STOCK AND OPTIONS SOAR", "body_text": " **********The feasting yesterday by Wall Street pros on the trading in Pennzoil stock will be long remembered - but perhaps not so long as the beating they could take today. **********In heavy trading, Pennzoil stock jumped $19.75, to $83, on rumors that it might be taken over by Texaco. It was the biggest dollar gainer on the New York Stock Exchange, as slightly more than 1.1 million shares traded hands. **********Pennzoil options soared even more remarkably. An investor who paid $375 yesterday morning for a January Pennzoil option could have cashed it in at the end of the day for an astounding $10,250. **********''It was a good day,'' said one arbitrager, ''if you were quick and knew the rumor first.'' **********But the rumor turned out to be false, according to Texaco and Pennzoil officials, who waited until late in the evening, well after the market had closed, to comment at all. **********And that hangs a big question mark over whether that lofty stock price can be supported. There are also likely to be serious questions over how a rumor that turns out to have been quite wide of the mark could have such a powerful impact on the market and whether it might have been deliberately spread. **********For securities regulators, meanwhile, who have been fighting a losing battle to control insider trading, it was not a good day. ''Frustration'' is how one senior securities regulator described the feeling in Washington yesterday, given that the jump suggested there may have been either trading by people with special knowledge of a potential deal, or manipulation of the market by someone planting false rumors. **********''There's no way you can stop this,'' the senior regulator said. **********The day began on a simple speculative note: Pennzoil was rumored to be meeting with Texaco about a settlement of their legal dispute over Texaco's takeover of the Getty Oil Company. A large payment to Pennzoil was in the offing, it was suspected. **********The activity in the company's stock was at first modest. But around midday, word began to spread that Pennzoil was having a board meeting, suggesting the possibility a deal had been reached with Texaco, And at about 2 P.M., a story circulated that Texaco would take Pennzoil over by swapping three and a half shares of its stock for every Pennzoil share. Pennzoil's stock was climbing. **********''I don't give those kinds of rumors much credence, but these seemed so precise and they seemed to be coming from the source,'' said an arbitrager. **********Several other arbitragers said they had also noticed the rumors did not vary. ''I'm not sure what that means,'' a trader said, ''but you normally see these things evolve more than that.'' It was particularly unusual in light of the fact that sources close to the oil giants later said no deal of the sort rumored had been proposed. One source close to the talks even suggested that the formal, behind-the-scenes offer made by Texaco might have followed the proliferation of rumors. **********Pennzoil's stock price eventually hit $85.50 in the last half-hour of trading, before slipping back to $83. That small decline suggested that some investors managed to slip out with their profits, before Pennzoil announced there was no deal. **********There was no telling, analysts said, what could happen to Pennzoil's share price today, except that trading likely would be wild again. **********Pennzoil's stock gain palled before what happened in the options market. On the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the January Pennzoil option, at a strike price of 75, rose to 10 1/4 in active trading, from 3/8 at the opening. Large as that was, it was not a record. Teledyne options had a larger gain once in 1984, an official said. **********In yesterday's trading, the New York Stock Exchange contacted Pennzoil about midday ''at a senior level,'' inquiring whether there were news developments to account for the price activity, Richard Torrenzano, an exchange spokesman, said. **********Pennzoil ''said that they had nothing to report,'' Mr. Torrenzano said. The exchange chose not to make any announcement that it had contacted the company, what Pennzoil had said,or to halt trading in Pennzoil's stock, which it can do if it feels such a pause would be fairer to the public. **********''There are times that I cannot comprehend how the exchange can allow trading to continue in these conditions,'' the senior securities regulator said. **********By that time, however, it hardly mattered. Buy orders had become so overwhelming on the chaotic exchange floor that trading was stopped by the exchange anyway from 3:10 to 3:42 because of an order imbalance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/14/world/the-un-today-july-14-1986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 11, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Less comprehensive indicators, notably industrial output and capacity utilization, have shown persistent weakness. Industrial output fell in February and again in March. **********The gain in today's report on gross national product - the total output of goods and services - came along with a sharp decline in inflation caused by the fall in oil prices. But many analysts say that such low inflation is unlikely to continue. **********Economists also suggested the strong improvement in the international trade picture may have been something of a fluke that distorted the overall growth figure. Overstatement of Growth Cited **********''I don't think very many people are going to read strength in these numbers,'' declared Jerry J. Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. The 3.2 percent rate followed a skimpy seven-tenths of 1 percent rate in the fourth quarter, he said, and ''probably overstates the strength of the economy by roughly a full percentage point.'' **********The report did little to prompt a rethinking of the widely held view that the Federal Reserve will shortly announce another cut in its discount rate, the rate at which it lends to banks and other financial institutions. ''I think they will go tomorrow,'' ventured Alan C. Lerner, a senior economist at the Bankers Trust Company. A cut in the discount rate is intended to spur expansion of the economy by easing borrowing costs, and it is considered desirable now because the economy is generally weak and inflation is low. **********The first-quarter growth rate means there is only a remote chance that Congress will have to reconsider Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation that requires a balanced budget by 1991. Under the law's ''recession clause,'' if two consecutive quarters show growth at less than a 1 percent rate, Congress must vote to reaffirm that the law becomes effective. The 3.2 percent growth would have to be revised downward severely for this to happen now. **********Today's report showed that the value of the gross national product was $3.62 trillion after adjustments. It was the Government's first report on the first-quarter G.N.P. because it has stopped calculating a ''flash'' estimate that had been based on sketchy data and was regarded as unreliable. **********Still, today's figure will be revised in future quarters as more data become available. For example, fourth-quarter growth was originally estimated at 3.2 percent, but was revised downward to 2.4 percent, then to 1.2 percent and finally to seven-tenths of 1 percent. **********The department also revised downward today its tally of corporate profits for the fourth quarter of last year. Profits from current production are now said to have fallen 1.9 percent, or $6 billion less than estimated a month ago. **********The 3.2 percent G.N.P. growth rate was the best since the first quarter of 1985, which showed a rate of increase of 3.7 percent. Administration Is Pleased **********The Reagan Administration made a characteristically upbeat assessment of today's G.N.P. data with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige declaring in a statement that ''prospects are good that we can achieve 4 percent real growth over the four quarters of 1986.'' He cited the beneficial effects of lower interest rates, suppressed inflation and the decline of the dollar over the past year. **********Less optimistic private analysts, however, tended to dwell on two facets of the G.N.P. report - inflation and trade - that they said needed to be interpreted warily. **********Lower inflation, in large part reflecting tumbling oil prices, is undoubtedly a good thing, they said, but it is not a sign of robust business. ''We're not going to continue to get these almost unprecedented drops in prices on a sustained basis,'' Mr. Jasinowski said. **********The fixed-weighted price index rose at a rate of only 2.2 percent in the first quarter, the lowest since 1972 when price controls were in effect. The fourth-quarter rate was 3.9 percent. **********The G.N.P.'s implicit price deflator, which unlike the fixed-weighted index reflects both changes in prices and in the composition of output, rose at a 2.5 percent rate in the quarter. Trade Data **********The trade data showed such an abrupt reversal in the quarter - real net exports of goods and services rose at a $14.8 billion annual rate in contrast to a decline of $21 billion in the preceding quarter - that most analysts believed the figures suspect. **********''Is this the beginning of what we've been looking for?'' wondered Joseph D. Hurd, an economist at the Crocker National Bank, referring to expectations for an improvement in the trade deficit caused by the decline of the dollar. ''There's no question that contributions like that are coming,'' he said, but added that those reported today seemed much too big and too fast. ''I'll have to see more numbers,'' Mr. Hurd concluded. **********Robert Ortner, the chief Commerce Department economist, seemed even more dubious about trade. ''I don't think we've turned the trend around on net exports yet,'' he asserted, adding that lower prices for imported oil could not have been a factor since the figures are adjusted for price changes. Other Data **********Other highlights of today's report included these: *********** Final sales rose at a 2.6 percent rate in the first quarter before adjustment for purchases of farm products by the Commodity Credit Corporation. *********** Personal consumption expenditures soared at a $24.4 billion rate, compared with an increase of only $800 million in the preceding quarter. This suggested consumption benefitted significantly from low inflation. *********** Nonresidential fixed investment fell at a $17.4 billion rate after rising $12.8 billion in the fourth quarter. *********** Business inventories rose at a $26 billion rate following a decline of $6.3 billion, much of the swing being due to farm inventories. **********The department also reported that the indexation of personal income taxes and other payments resulted in $7.4 billion less revenue for the Treasury than had indexation not been on the books."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/28/business/2-tell-of-oil-tax-policy.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1986-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 336, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 TELL OF OIL TAX POLICY", "print_headline": "2 TELL OF OIL TAX POLICY", "body_text": " **********Reagan Administration officials told Congress today that a tax on imported oil would be unwise energy policy, ''costly to the national economy'' and potentially ''unacceptable to the President.'' **********Nonetheless, the officials - Danny J.

The auto makers are also the most important customers of other robotics companies. **********Laura Conigliaro, a robotics analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said sales of robots were ''actually going to be flat or down this year for the first time ever and significantly down next year.'' **********Eric Middelstadt, the president and chief executive officer of GMFanuc, a four-year-old joint venture between G.M. and Fanuc, a Japanese robotics company. said: ''It looks like things will flatten out for two or three years. We had to take action to help the company stay healthy for the long run.'' Stagnation Projected **********Going into this year, GMFanuc had been projecting sales growth from its 1985 total of $187 million to more than $240 million this year. But despite its efforts to diversify, the company remained highly dependent on G.M., whose pace-setting automation program accounted for about three-quarters of GMFanuc's sales. **********When G.M. decided this spring to delay or drop plans for several major new models in the coming year and to slow its investment in advanced manufacturing technology, the projections shifted from strong growth to stagnation. **********''We had hired a number of people to win orders that have now been canceled or delayed,'' Mr. Middelstadt said. The restructuring calls for eliminating 200 of GMFanuc's 690 employees by the end of the year, with the company offering a severance package to encourage voluntary departures. In addition, product development has been consolidated under Lothar Rossol, a vice president and the chief technical officer, and sales and service efforts have been reorganized under three other vice presidents. **********Analysts said that the announcement confirmed rumors that had been circulating through the industry for months. ''This is a public pronouncement by the strongest company in the industry that things are tough,'' said Mrs. Conigliaro of Prudential-Bache. ''You can imagine what that says to the others. Some are going to say 'Uncle.' '' **********Last November, Mrs. Conigliaro estimated that robot sales would grow to $690 million this year, from $595 million. By May, she had cut this year's projection to $625 million. Restructuring Elsewhere **********A number of other major companies, including the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the General Electric Company, have already restructured their robotics business in the face of the spending slowdown. The only major American company reporting healthy demand and profitability is Cincinnati Milacron, the former market leader. GMFanuc overtook Milacron in 1984 and last year took 31 percent of the market, with sales triple those of Milacron. **********Milacron said today that orders from aerospace and agricultural equipment makers had compensated for the softening in the auto market. **********GMFanuc will struggle to break even this year, after earning about $10 million last year, according to Mr. Middelstadt. An interruption in sales growth is not the only financial problem that led to today's restructuring. The decline of the dollar against the yen is driving up costs as Fanuc, the supplier of almost all GMFanuc's robots, raises prices to compensate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/22/business/company-news-mayflower-group-agrees-to-buyout.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mayflower Group Agrees to Buyout", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Mayflower Group Agrees to Buyout", "body_text": " **********Mayflower Group Inc. said it had signed a definitive agreement with a group led by senior management to take the company private in a leveraged buyout for $242.5 million in cash. **********Mayflower, the nation's fourth-largest moving company, said the group would take the company private in a tender offer that is scheduled to begin by Oct. 27.

His Israeli doctor has said that his mother's bone marrow is incompatible and that there was a 25 percent chance that the sister's marrow would be suitable. **********Since Mrs. Flerov first sought to aid her brother in March, her request for a travel visa has been supplemented by a plea from Dr. Robert P. Gale, the bone-marrow transplant specialist who assisted in the treatment of victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. **********The case has also aroused the interest of Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, who has intervened with Soviet Embassy officials in Washington without success. He said Tuesday that an embassy official had told him no visa would be granted. **********''He said it is not going to happen,'' the Congressman reported in a telephone conversation. ''We want to increase international pressure because Mr. Shirman does not have much time. His life is measured in weeks or months right now.'' **********When Mrs. Flerov first approached the visa authorities in March, she asked for a travel visa to Israel with her husband, Viktor, and their children to have her marrow tested and, if it was compatible, to have a transplant. **********The visa authorities advised them at that time that a temporary visit would be impossible. The Soviet Union and Israel have no diplomatic relations. **********In June, she was called in by the visa office and was asked whether she would consider making the trip alone. **********''I said it was impossible for me to go there and be without my husband and children for I don't know how long,'' she said. The Flerovs have two daughters, Dariya, 7, and Mariana, 5. **********Two weeks later, Mrs. Flerov said, the visa agency again changed course and said that a short-term visit might be possible if she and her husband were recommended for the trip by their employers. Foreign Travel Requirement **********Foreign travel for Soviet citizens in general is heavily restricted, and references from places of employment are usually required as part of the application process. **********Mr. Flerov, a physicist, had no difficulty in getting a reference. **********But Mrs. Flerov, on asking for one from her place of employment, the Central Urban Planning Institute, was accused of having kept her mother's emigration a secret and was denied a reference."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/business/company-news-vestron-video-in-movie-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vestron Video In Movie Venture", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Vestron Video In Movie Venture", "body_text": " **********Vestron Video, an independent videocassette company, and Integrated Resources Inc., a financial services company, have formed a joint venture to finance and distribute motion pictures. **********The output of the joint venture could total up to 15 pictures annually, with a combined production and releasing cost of $100 million or more.

This afternoon, crowds jammed the city's historic center to take a Sunday afternoon walk at the end of the four-day Christmas holiday. People were shoulder to shoulder around the Piazza Navona, where a kind of carnival is held every year. No substantial police presence dampened the robust mood. Investigation of 1985 Attack **********The concern about terrorist attacks comes as magistrates are concluding their investigation of the terrorist attack at the Rome airport on Dec. 27, 1985. The magistrates are expected to file the Italian equivalent of an indictment within a few weeks, according to judicial officials. **********Only one of the four gunmen survived the Rome airport attack, and he has at least partly cooperated with the investigation, according to the officials. **********The magistrates have looked into the training and assistance of the assailants as they moved from Lebanon through Syria to Italy, the officials said. They indicated that trials in absentia may be sought for several of those involved in preparing the attack. **********Twenty people, including five Americans, were killed and more than 100 were wounded in the Rome attack and a simultaneous assault at the Vienna airport. About 100 people gathered at the Rome airport chapel on Saturday for a memorial mass on the anniversary of the attack."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/01/business/advertising-yugo-america-shifts-to-fledgling-agency.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yugo America Shifts To Fledgling Agency", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Yugo America Shifts To Fledgling Agency", "body_text": " **********Yugo America of Montvale, N.J., which has been selling a low-priced Yugoslav-built car in this country for the last year, has left Rosenfeld, Sirowitz & Humphrey and assigned the business to Lambert, Dale & Bernhard, an agency created in April. **********According to Len Sirowitz, although the Yugo people had talked about a $15 million introductory budget, the spending has been more like $4 million. **********A co-chairman of the agency, he also said that because the client was a new company, R.S.&H. was insisting on money up front from the client when buying media.

Marcos said Tuesday that his opponents' protests over electoral fraud and violence were ''a childish display of petulance.'' **********At the same time, he said he would abide by the results of an official vote certification by the National Assembly. Two-thirds of the assembly members are Marcos supporters. **********His opponent, Corazon C. Aquino, called the National Assembly procedure, which is mandated under the Philippine Constitution, a distortion of democracy. She urged the United States not to come to the support ''in the name of shortsighted self-interest'' of a man who she said ''continues to steal our precious votes.'' **********A broad feeling is growing in Manila that recent statements in Washington indicated that the White House had decided to support Mr. Marcos, as the outcome of the election became tangled in charges of fraud and in procedural complications. **********Mr. Reagan's statements at his news conference drew immediate criticism today from supporters of Mrs. Aquino, who said they believed she had won the popular vote and that Mr. Marcos had employed ''massive fraud, terrorism, and heavy vote-buying. **********''It is clear that Mr. Reagan does not realize the seriousness of the Philippines situation,'' said Homobono Adaza, an opposition assemblyman. He said a continuation of the Marcos presidency would ultimately endanger the presence of American bases in the Philippines. **********An aide to Mr. Marcos said he believed the President had won ''a loveless victory'' similar to the 1972 victory of Richard M. Nixon over George S. McGovern for the United States presidency, suggesting that in both cases most voters had supported a candidate they disliked. He said that although there might be broad popular sentiment for change, the Filipino people did not see Mrs. Aquino as a workable alternative. Again, No Votes Are Counted **********The National Assembly began examining ballots Tuesday, but parliamentary disputes and questions of a quorum brought the session to another halt before the first ballot had been counted. The certification process was put off for a day on Monday when the legislature bogged down in procedural disputes. **********In a protest demonstration attended by 3,000 people, members of a leftist group called Bayan, many of whom boycotted the election, warned that a Marcos victory would give impetus to the radical left. **********''These people are not really Communists, but they have been pushed to the left even more,'' said a middle-class man in a white shirt. ''America is our motherland. We have thought that America was our friend. But when Reagan backs the dictator Marcos we must turn away.'' **********The sentiment was echoed on the floor of the National Assembly Tuesday by Mr. Adaza, who said United States support for Mr. Marcos at this stage ''will open the floodgates for a number of people to start talking with the left.'' **********''It will be the only viable alternative,'' he said. 'Not Our' View **********''If this is democracy in their view, it is not in ours,'' said another assembly member, Ramon V. Mitra Jr., referring to statements in Washington that praised the workings of the two-party system in the Philippines. **********''The clamor for removal of the bases will escalate,'' he said. The United States has voiced concern over the future under a new administration of two major military bases in the Philippines, Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station. **********Mr. Marcos's Information Minister, Gregorio S. Cendana, said that ''in effect, the President of the United States is giving some kind of moral support for President Marcos.'' **********One of Mr. Marcos's allies, Arturo Pacificador, a member of the assembly, said: ''The President has, I think, found out the true picture in this country. It will really bolster our image in other countries.'' 'Shameful,' Aquino Says **********At a news conference Tuesday, Mrs. Aquino called the election ''one of the most shameful electoral frauds ever perpetrated against a people in the name of democracy.'' **********She spoke of ''the violence, the stolen boxes, the intimidation, the millions of voters whose franchise was stolen by the deliberate confusions of voters' lists and the substitution of spurious returns.'' **********At his own news conference, Mr. Marcos called such accusations ''a smear campaign.'' **********''Let's just stop all this,'' he said. ''This is childish. Let us act like mature men. Let's forget about this childish display of petulance just because our figures don't agree.'' **********Mrs. Aquino also addressed American doubts about her post-election tactics, saying, ''May I also reassure the world that we mean to conclude this business as we began it, peacefully but determinedly.'' **********''Our power has been the people and their spirit,'' she said. ''His has been guns. We hope we do not have to mobilize this nation. We hope that Mr. Marcos will find it in himself to concede now so that I can begin the process of reconciliation in a climate of amity, unity and peace.'' 'They Have Been Defeated' **********Mr. Marcos dismissed such statements, saying, ''Now they know they have been defeated, and that's why they are defying everything, defying the President, to show that they have not lost their animal, their strength of character.'' **********He said he believed election disputes could be settled ''not by fisticuffs or shooting or any violence, but by a quiet, simple procedure of comparing the official election returns.'' **********Every figure reported by half a dozen vote-counting procedures is disputed by one of the parties. The latest reports from the Government-run commission on elections showed Mr. Marcos holding a lead of 52 percent to 48 percent. Computer technicians employed by this election commission have walked off the job, saying the published totals were falsified. 'Quick Count' Comes to Halt **********A ''quick count'' by the citizens' poll-watching group known as Namfrel, the National Movement for Free Elections, slowed almost to a halt Tuesday. Its chairmen said he was considering calling it off because of his belief that the remaining tallies, from districts where Namfrel inspectors were blocked by Mr. Marcos's backers, might have been tampered with. **********As of Tuesday, Namfrel showed Mrs. Aquino leading by a margin of 53 percent to 47 percent. The margin has been shrinking, leading some Namfrel officials to suggest that the later tallies have been manipulated. The Ebbing of Emotion **********After the excitement of the campaign, the huge voter turnout on election day and the passion and tension that accompanied them, the Philippine election had been reduced today to arguments over clerical procedures in the National Assembly. **********As procedural arguments droned on through the evening, rows of metal ballot boxes waited unopened on the aquamarine rug. Spectators favoring both parties jeered and applauded from the balcony. **********Mrs. Aquino called Mr. Marcos's new emphasis on legislature's separate count part of his ''seemingly inexhaustible bag of tricks for yet another means to cheat the people of their victory.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/13/business/credit-markets-treasury-rates-hold-steady.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1986-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 894, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Rates Hold Steady", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Rates Hold Steady", "body_text": " **********Interest rates on Treasury securities were little changed yesterday, despite widespread talk about the likelihood of interest-rate cuts by the world's largest economies within the next month or so. **********Outside the Treasury market, activity was brisk in the tax-exempt and corporate sectors. **********In the tax-exempt market, traders and investors are once again focusing their attention on the Federal tax bill now being prepared in Washington. Although local government issuers and securities firms are dismayed at proposals that would make interest on some kinds of bonds subject to the alternative mininum income tax on individuals, the bill had an initially favorable effect on prices of outstanding securities. **********Roundup Ahead of Bill **********''When the proposed tax legislation comes through, it looks like it should limit volume of new bond issues, so everybody is trying to round up what is already available,'' said W. J. Turner L. Cobden, senior vice president at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. Prices of outstanding bonds rose 1/2 point or more, and underwriters were able to reduce interest rates slightly on some new issues. **********A flurry of taxable financings, which began Monday with $1.3 billion of new corporate issues and $232 million of collateralized mortgage obligations, continued yesterday with $825 million of corporates and about $124 million of collateralized mortgage issues. **********The nearly $2.5 billion of new corporate issues ''has increased dealer inventories somewhat, but not to levels that are too burdensome,'' said a syndicate official at one of the largest underwriting firms. An official at another firm who was intimately involved in many of this week's financings noted that ''issuers view the current environment as an opportunity, but investors are a bit more wary, and there is no buying frenzy.'' **********Before the last two days, the supply of investment-grade corporate issues had been light, with fewer than $1 billion of new issues sold in the last week of July and about $1.2 billion last week. Large Utility Offerings **********Yesterday's largest financings included a $200 million issue of Pacific Gas and Electric bonds yielding 9.40 percent to maturity in 2019 through the First Boston Corporation, and Columbia Gas System's $250 million two-part offering of BBB-rated seven-year debentures yielding 9.097 percent and 25-year debentures yielding 10 1/2 percent through Morgan Stanley & Company. **********Among the new tax-exempt financings benefiting from good demand was a $420 million issue of the Michigan Municipal Bond Authority, underwritten by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The authority, which is selling bonds on behalf of dozens of local governments in the state, is taking advantage of low interest rates on short-term tax-exempt issues and tentantively offering the issue with yields ranging from 4 5/8 percent for the Sept. 25 to 5 3/4 percent for a May 15, 1988, maturity. Those rates are as much as 1/8 percentage point lower than contemplated early yesterday. **********At the conversion dates, investors may redeem the Michigan bonds, accept a new fixed long-term interest rate to be announced at that time or accept a new 30-day interest rate to be set if local governments are not prepared to make immediate use of the funds. Until conversion, the bonds are backed by a pool of government securities, but afterward they will be an obligation of the local government, not the state. Heavy Selling Noted **********Although prices of Treasury notes and bonds were little changed on the day, securities dealers noted that there was heavy selling activity by a wide variety of customers. Following the sharp price gains since last week, ''there was some profit taking and the Street has been absorbing the paper,'' noted Gordon I. Miller Jr., an executive at Chase Manhattan Government Securities Inc. He noted that many dealers and other speculators are expecting weak economic statistics this week to raise prices and reduce yields. **********By late in the day, the Treasury's new 6 5/8 percent notes due in 1989 were offered at 100 1/8, up 3/32 to yield 6.58 percent, or up from the average price of about 99 23/32 at last Tuesday's auction. The 7 1/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2016 were offered at 98 26/32, down 2/32, to yield 7.35 percent, well above last Thursday's average price of nearly 95 17/32. **********Today's announcement of retail sales data for July prompted forecasts with a range of half a percentage point up or down, and many economists expect a decline in the industrial production data to be announced Friday. Reasoning on Lower Rates **********Many analysts expect that the Federal Reserve Board may move to encourage lower rates, not only as a response to the sluggish growth in the American economy, but also as part of a coordinated program of rate reductions among major industrial countries, particularly West Germany and Japan. Although German officials have resisted earlier suggestions that they lower rates, recent press reports indicate they are now considering such a move. **********A. J. Warner, senior adviser to the Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation, noted that ''Germany could justify participating in a concerted rate cut around the time of the I.M.F. meeting, in the name of international harmony.'' But in terms of the domestic German economy, which grew briskly in the second quarter, he said that monetary stimulus was not as appropriate as a more generous fiscal policy with sizable tax cuts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/29/business/advertising-ogilvy-has-new-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ogilvy Has New Unit", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Ogilvy Has New Unit", "body_text": " **********The Sage (for strategic assets group enterprises) Group is the latest subsidiary of the Ogilvy Group, which is also the parent of Ogilvy & Mather.

To his colleagues, he was unremarkable. **********''He's a man that one considered nothing out of the ordinary, nothing distinguishable from the crowd,'' said one of his superiors at the Center for Science and Technology for Development, where Mr. Zakharov was a scientific officer. **********''In general, his performance was not bad. He carried out his responsibilities, shall I say, reasonably well. He certainly wasn't the type that one would say really took initiative or came up with ideas. He was never given an outstanding rating.'' A Charmed Existence **********The 39-year-old Soviet physicist made such a small impression on Amilcar F. Ferrari, the former executive director of the center, that Mr. Ferrari had difficulty remembering him. ''My recollection was that he was all right,'' Mr. Ferrari said when reached by telephone in Rio de Janeiro. ''He does not jog my memory as someone who was especially good or especially bad.'' **********Compared to most Soviet bureaucrats, Mr. Zakharov led a charmed existence: he held a $49,153-a-year job with little responsibility in an obscure scientific division of the United Nations and went home to a comfortable apartment in a safe neighborhood in the Bronx where his American neighbors liked him. **********On weekends he drove to New Jersey for bargain shopping and indulged in what neighbors said were his two passions: playing tennis on public courts in Riverdale and watching spy movies on his VCR. **********That life vanished when he was arrested two weeks ago by three F.B.I. agents on a subway platform in Queens and charged with espionage. On Tuesday, a Federal grand jury in Brooklyn officially charged him with three counts of espionage against the United States. A Friend of His Landlords **********Unlike most Russians living in New York, Mr. Zakharov was successful in integrating himself into mainstream American life. He was so ordinary and likable that his landlords, Murray and Yvette Vogel, opened their home to him. **********''We didn't live in the same apartment, but it was the same house,'' said Mr. Vogel, an Orthodox Jew who coordinates science programs in the Riverdale public school system. ''If I needed medicines or something, he would pick it up; or I'd go on an errand for him.'' **********The Vogels invited their tenants to family birthday parties and the two families sometimes spent evenings together, watching television or discussing politics. ''He liked to watch American movies, especially James Bond,'' Mr. Vogel said. ''Our families would watch together, always either spy movies or shows on HBO.'' **********The four Vogel boys even taught the Zakharovs' daughter, Irina, how to play video games. **********Talking politics was more difficult. ''He was open, but he realized we have our own point of view, as Americans,'' Mr. Vogel said . ''He admitted there was a problem with Soviet Jews, but we didn't go into depth, because we both realized we didn't want to get into deep political things.'' Daylong Shopping Trips **********The only thing Mr. Zakharov said about his work was that he was helping underdeveloped countries in science and technology, according to Mr. Vogel. When Mr. Vogel talked about his work, Mr. Zakharov would say, ''Murray, you should get a raise for what you do.'' **********Mr. Vogel hoped he could teach the Zakharovs by example. ''I was hoping, maybe living with a Jewish family, that he would see the way I lived, see that I pray at home and observe the Sabbath and take something of it home with him to Russia.'' **********Like many Russians here, the Zakharovs would take daylong excursions to New Jersey on Sundays in search of bargains. ''He would go to a farm where he bought corn and potatoes cheap,'' Mr. Vogel said. ''I would help him bring his bundles in. I learned from him where to do your shopping if you want bargains.'' **********At his United Nations office, tucked away across the street from the main headquarters, Mr. Zakharov's main impact appears to have been his sense of humor, according to his colleauges. His jokes were so successful with the secretaries that their laughter spilled into the adjoining offices. He regaled them with stories of his vacation last June to his family home in the countryside outside of Moscow and showed off snapshots of his family. 'He Smiled With Ease' **********''He wasn't a stiff, gray type like the other Soviets,'' one of his colleagues said. ''He smiled with ease and mingled with his employees. He was a gentle person.'' **********Although his colleagues were dismayed by his arrest on espionage charges, they were not surprised by the news that the F.B.I. had had Mr. Zakharov under surveillance since April 1983, soon after he is is said to have first contacted a student attending Queens College who was working as a double agent. It is widely assumed that most Eastern European employees of the United Nations report back regularly to their missions and are required to hand over part of their hard currency earnings. **********Mr. Zakharov was an exchange student in the United States and came to the United Nations in December 1982 to replace another Russian. Like all Soviet employees, he was assigned to the United Nations by his Government and was on a fixed-term contract that would have expired at the end of 1987. **********He was one of four or five officials who followed developments in science and technology in the United Nations system for an annual report written by the department. In particular, he researched United Nations involvement in energy resources and followed the involvement of the European Economic Community in science and technology. None of Work Classified **********None of the information that the department works with is classified, according to a department official. **********According to his superiors, he was not part of the ''inner circle'' of the center, an office of 32 employees created in 1979 to compile global analyses of how developing nations can set policies for scientific and technological advancement. **********Under order from the legal department, no official at the United Nations is authorized to speak publicly about the Zakharov case. His office was locked after a vandal wrote anti-Soviet slogans on his desk blotter, a colleague said. A handwritten note on the door says: ''Sealed by U.N. security.

While these people are not in immediate danger of dying, he said, they would have significant long-term health problems. **********The official Novosti press agency reported today that one of the Soviet doctors at Hospital No. 6 told the agency that 80 patients were in serious condition. **********Novosti quoted the doctor, Angelina Guskova, who has worked closely with Dr. Gale, as saying, ''About 80 of the 120 patients currently in Hospital No. 6 are in extreme danger.'' **********She reported that 70 of the 200 patients originally sent to Hospital No. 6 had been discharged. **********Dr. Gale, who is making his second visit here since the accident, said Soviet authorities initially suspected that about 1,000 people living or working near the reactor might have received severe doses of radiation. **********When these people had been carefully examined, he said, 300 were hospitalized. The others, he said, were found to have received less dangerous doses but would have to be closely monitored in the future for long-term health consequences, including leukemia and other forms of cancer. Visit to Reactor Area **********Dr. Gale said he planned to visit the Chernobyl area early next week to begin a joint study with Soviet doctors of the long-term health consequences of the accident. **********Novosti quoted Miss Guskova, the Moscow doctor, as saying that a special medical team assembled in Moscow flew to the Chernobyl area within hours of the accident and examined 1,000 people who had been at or near the power station in the first hours after a series of explosions damaged the Unit 4 reactor. **********Miss Guskova, according to Novosti, said that the team initially determined that 100 people had received severe doses but that the number swelled as power station employees developed symptoms associated with radiation exposure. **********Yevgeny I. Chazov, a top Soviet surgeon and Deputy Health Minister, said at a news conference in West Germany today that 11 of 19 patients at Hospital No. 6 who received marrow transplants had died. **********Dr. Gale declined to say how many transplant recipients had died. **********The destruction of bone marrow, the ultimate source of the body's blood and immune defense cells, is one of the most life-threatening consequences of exposure to intense radiation. #2 Types of Operations Thirteen of the people exposed to high radiation doses at Chernobyl were given bone marrow transplants by Soviet and American doctors. Six others received a marrow substitute extracted from the livers of aborted fetuses in a procedure known as a fetal liver transplant. **********Miss Guskova told Novosti that Dr. Gale and several Western colleagues who worked with him at Hospital No. 6 after the accident were ''erudite and top-class specialists.'' **********She said, ''Dr. Gale's expertise was extremely helpful.'' **********Miss Guskova added that ''American physicians had much to learn in Moscow'' about diagnosing the level of radiation doses received by victims. **********She said: ''The excellent professionalism of our Western colleagues is limited to very narrow fields.

These quiet, clean machines have been around since the auto industry's earliest days. By 1910, one out of every three cars or trucks on American roads rolled along under electric power provided by batteries. Most of the batteries were not rechargeable, but their owners seemed perfectly willing to replace them whenever need be. **********Even though gasoline-powered cars were cheaper, some motorists stubbornly refused to give up their electrics. Henry Ford's wife, Clara, tooled around in an electric car made by the Detroit Electric Company until 1930; she hated the noise and fumes of the Model T's that made her family rich. **********Still, electric cars have never really lived up to the promises of their promoters, largely because no one could make one that matched the range or power of conventional cars. **********''The basic problem is the battery,'' said Mr. Klimisch of G.M. ''Nobody's got one that's affordable or rechargeable, and that means you can't get the range or performance that people are used to.'' Adds Mr. Healy, the analyst: ''Until somebody invents a much better battery, it's strictly golf cart time.'' **********A few years ago, it looked as though such a battery was around the corner. In 1981, Gulf and Western announced that by 1985, it would be producing 100 zinc-chloride battery systems a day, each of which could power an electric car at 55 miles an hour for 150 miles without a recharge. The company claimed that, as long as gasoline was priced above 46 cents a gallon, its battery was cost-effective. **********But that battery has yet to leave the laboratory, and the first car powered by it has yet to leave the factory. Gulf and Western will not discuss why it abandoned the project, other than to say it got out of manufacturing altogether. But other experts note that, had the battery been truly promising, the company would probably have sold the rights to another company rather than simply give up. **********''No manufacturer is coming out with them,'' said Walter V. Laski, president of the Electric Automobile Association, a 12-year-old group that had 2,000 members a few years ago but now has only 500. **********Like most current electric car owners, Mr. Laski built his electric car himself. He says it can go ''a few hundred miles, depending on the traffic,'' but he rarely drives it these days. The reason: Few roadside rest stops have convenient curbside electrical outlets, so places to recharge are few and far between."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/03/business/new-gillette-product.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 48, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Gillette Product", "print_headline": "New Gillette Product", "body_text": " **********The Gillette Company said today it would introduce a disposable twin-blade razor with a strip that releases a lubricant for smoother shaving.

When her father, Godofredo, saw her finally left without animation after her long glassy-eyed struggle for life, he knelt and wept. **********The grandmother, a thin withered-looking woman, rejected advice to hide the small body in a shopping box as a ruse against the superstitions of cabdrivers. She carried Lycel against her shoulder as if she were alive. But people in the hallway knew about the death when the father stopped and took out his tape measure to get the child's dimensions for building the coffin. **********They arrived at the purok after a silent ride. As the grandmother carried the buntinged corpse into the community, Lycel's mother, Linda, big in the ninth month of her eighth pregnancy, twisted and cried in the arms of neighbors. **********The purok, the word used here to denote a city block, is an intense conglomeration of stacked and attached shacks, of children, mongrel dogs, mostly silent adults, and of the grayest colors and interior shadows that showed off Lycel serenely on her tiny bier. It was quickly built of bedsheet and candles on the floor of her family's one-room hut. Instantly, a huddle of small children peeked in to see one of their own in death, and a piglet watched, too, through a hole in the opposite wall. **********Two hours later, the same final homecoming, with the shock and the weeping and a bier set on a small borrowed bench, had to be accorded a neighboring victim of malnutrition, 2-year-old Rodolfo Sarsaba. **********He was the fourth child to die from malnutrition in the purok of 350 people in the last three weeks. Two children are in the hospital, and 23 others are on the ''third-degree malnutrition'' watch. In the purok, mortality is considered shaded, and the worst youngsters get a small bowl of porridge at night from the neighborhood health worker. **********At the dire end of this process is the ''intensive care'' bed at the hospital, one like the others except that as death approaches the nurses turn on a floor lamp with an ordinary bulb to warm the doomed child, and they pack a hot-water bottle against the little legs. These gestures in the badly equipped institution seem designed to soothe the sad families that gather, sometimes for as many as 10 child deaths a day, according to Dr. Daniel B. Duenas, the floor physician. **********Rodolfo's miniature life seemed reflected in the repose of his emaciated body in the light of a single candle. He lent a princely glow to the family's single shabby room, renting for $1.50 a month, which the father can barely pay because he is jobless, like most men of the purok. **********The price of a small white coffin is beyond the income of purok residents, and so the searching and begging each time a child dies becomes part of the funeral ritual. It is a reminder that the notion of a revolution is one thing in Manila, another in the slum blocks of Bacolod. **********''When Marcos fled it was the middle class doing the celebrating,'' said the Rev. Ireneo Gordoncillo, head of the Catholic Action Center here. For the political change in Manila to be a true revolution, he said, it would have to include reformation of the wage scale that finds sugar workers here often paid less than a dollar a day in the six months the depressed sugar industry might have some jobs. **********A genuine revolution, the priest said, also would include basic justice for longstanding abuses, such as a massacre in Escalante in which military men shot and killed 21 sugar farmers involved in a labor protest. **********This definition was seconded over at the provincial jail by Reynaldo Espinas, a labor organizer for the National Federation of Sugar Workers, who was locked up in August with eight other organizers on charges of ''rebellion.'' **********''That is not a real revolution,'' he said of the new Government of President Corazon C. Aquino. ''You have to struggle for the exploited masses.'' **********Neither man described himself as an advocate of the Communist New People's Army, which uses some of the same language to justify its call for violent revolution. **********In the purok, the grandmother found a small rag of vivid green to keep the flies off Lycel Obligado's face. Over at the Sarsaba hut, Rodolfo senior had no money for a coffin for his son. Neighbors began passing the hat for the 500 pesos ($22) needed for the coffin, an enormous sum that would be equal to a month's salary, if there were work. After two hours, they had 10 pesos. **********''The feeling of Cory is the same as the mother, all mothers,'' Lordis Almario, the midwife in the purok who is expecting her seventh child, said as she held the sixth against her hip.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, as a ''pariah'' for his ''longstanding involvement in terrorism'' and threatened further moves against Libya beyond economic action. 'Further Steps Will Be Taken' **********''If these steps do not end Qaddafi's terrorism, I promise you that further steps will be taken,'' said Mr. Reagan, who asserted that there was ''irrefutable evidence'' of the Libyan leader's involvement in the terrorist attacks at the airports in Rome and Vienna on Dec. 27. Nineteen people died in the attacks, including five Americans and four of the Arab gunmen, and more than 110 were wounded. **********Speaking of Colonel Qaddafi, Mr. Reagan said tonight, ''I find he's not only a barbarian, but he's flaky.'' **********Mr. Reagan defended his Administration's restraint in moving against terrorists. Although it may appear ''that we sit here and are not doing anything,'' he said, 126 terrorist missions have been ''aborted'' by American efforts in the last year. He declined to discuss details of the actions. Effect Seen as Marginal **********The economic effect of Mr. Reagan's executive order is expected to be marginal. Annual trade between Libya and the United States is only about $300 million as a result of sanctions the United States has previously imposed. **********But the President's decision and comments were plainly designed to intensify pressure on American allies for action against the Qaddafi Government and to warn the Libyan leader that military action remained possible. **********At one point, Mr. Reagan said: ''Qaddafi deserves to be treated as a pariah in the world community. We call on our friends in Western Europe and elsewhere to join with us in isolating him.'' Many European allies have refused to join American efforts to punish Libya. **********Administration officials said Mr. Reagan's order meant, in essence, that any American other than a journalist who remained in Libya and bought or sold anything there could be fined and would face up to 10 years in prison in the United States. **********''U.S. companies will no longer pump Libyan oil or purchase it for sale anywhere in the world,'' said a White House fact sheet accompanying Mr. Reagan's statement. ''U.S. construction and management firms will no longer aid major Libyan projects. Engineering and technical support for Libyan projects will no longer be provided by Americans. Criminal sanctions will face any American participating in the Libyan economy.'' **********Mr. Reagan notified Congress of his actions in a letter stating that he had ''exercised statutory authority to declare a national emergency.'' President Appears Fit **********Mr. Reagan, wearing a dark suit and striped tie, appeared fit as he took questions from reporters in the East Room of the White House. **********He touched on several subjects other than Libya, including plans for his second summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. The President said no date had been set for the meeting, which is to be held in Washington. He said that while ''June would be a nice time to do it,'' the Russians had suggested the fall. **********In his remarks on Libya, Mr. Reagan declared: ''The Rome and Vienna murders are only the latest in a series of brutal terrorist acts committed under Qaddafi's backing. Qaddafi and other Libyan officials have publicly admitted that the Libyan Government has abetted and supported the notorious Abu Nidal terrorist group, which was directly responsible for the Rome and Vienna attacks.'' **********''Qaddafi called them heroic actions,'' said Mr. Reagan. ''I call them criminal outrages by an outlaw regime.'' **********Mr. Reagan said that earlier American steps against Libya ''have not been sufficient.'' **********''Tougher, more comprehensive measures are required by the international community,'' he added. ''Accordingly, I have signed today an executive order stating that the policies and actions of the Government of Libya constitute a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.'' **********Mr. Reagan said Americans who violated his executive order would face ''appropriate penalties.'' The main statutory basis for these penalties, cited in the executive order, is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law that gives the President broad powers to prohibit or regulate foreign exchange, banking and commercial transactions with a foreign country. Making It Difficult to Stay **********A senior Administration official said that by banning financial transactions with Libya the President had made it very difficult for Americans to live there. The action ''effectively prevents them from living in Libya,'' the official said, ''because they are not able to engage in any transactions whatever.'' **********''That would mean paying the rent, buying the groceries,'' the official said, ''and therefore, effectively, it is a signal that we think it is time for them to depart - a signal that we have sent in the past, but never quite with the effect under this order.'' **********President Carter invoked the same law to prohibit certain transactions with Iran and to block Iranian assets in the United States in 1979. **********The decision by President Reagan was the latest of several moves by his Administration against Libya. In 1981, Mr. Reagan broke diplomatic relations with Libya, barred most travel there and urged Americans who live and work there to leave. In 1982 he banned the import of Libyan crude oil, a ban that was extended to refined oil in November of last year. **********During his news conference Mr. Reagan, who stumbled at times over several words, contended that Libya under Colonel Qaddafi serves as a haven for international terrorism. **********''By providing material support to terrorist groups which attack U.S. citizens,'' he said, ''Libya has engaged in armed aggression against the United States under established principles of international law, just as if it had used its own armed forces.'' Evidence of Involvement **********Asked to elaborate on the ''irrefutable evidence'' of Colonel Qaddafi's involvement in the airport attacks, Mr. Reagan said, ''There are things that should not be revealed.'' **********But he said ''we are satisfied, yes,'' as to the Qaddafi Government's involvement, and added, ''I don't think that his regime is doing anything without his guidance.'' **********Asserting that there was evidence that guerrilla training camps had been set up in Libya, despite Colonel Qaddafi's denials, Mr. Reagan said, ''I don't think he's capable of telling the truth about these things.'' **********The President said that Colonel Qaddafi at first openly praised the attacks in Rome and Vienna, only to say he was ''distressed'' by them when he got word that the United States aircraft carrier Coral Sea had left Naples. **********''I think he was speaking more honestly the first time,'' Mr. Reagan said. Remarks on Americans in Libya **********Discussing the remaining Americans in Libya, Mr. Reagan said, ''You have to consider them as potential hostages.'' Asked if their presence was a factor in considering whether to use military force, the President replied: ''Very obviously they have to be a consideration.'' **********Mr. Reagan was asked if his use of the term ''flaky'' to describe Colonel Qaddafi meant he believed that the Libyan leader was emotionally unbalanced. ''No,'' the President replied. ''I just think that the man is a zealot. He is pursuing a revolutionary cause that could affect a great many countries.'' **********''You have to be on guard against virtually any kind of act,'' he added. **********Mr. Reagan also said that the subject of Soviet arms supplies was discussed at his summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, in Geneva in November. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Libya, Mr. Reagan said, was one reason for American suspicions about Soviet policy. Threat by Abu Nidal Group **********Mr. Reagan's comments came as the Palestinian guerrilla group headed by Abu Nidal threatened reprisals against what it called threats against Libya ''by America and the leaders of the Zionist entity,'' a reference to Israel. **********The threat was included in a statement signed by the central committee of the Fatah Revolutionary Council that was distributed in Palestinian districts in Lebanon. Excerpts from the statement were carried in Beirut newspapers today. **********Fatah Revolutionary Council is the title that Abu Nidal chose for his faction when he broke away from Al Fatah, the mainstream Palestinian movement headed by Yasir Arafat, in the 1970's. **********Another pro-Libyan group in Lebanon said it would carry out suicide attacks inside the United States and Israel if those countries attacked Libya. The threat came from the Movement of Arab Revolutionary Committees in Lebanon. **********In Fez, Morocco, the 45-member Islamic Conference Organization declared itself in ''firm solidarity'' with Libya, and condemned ''aggressive escalation on the part of international imperialism and the Zionist entity'' against the Qaddafi Government. The United States was not named. **********Colonel Qaddafi asserted on Sunday that there were no Palestinian training camps in Libya and that his regime was not responsible for the airport attacks last month. The Reagan Administration called the Qaddafi comments ''patently false'' and said the Libyan Government had a ''proven record of complicity in international terrorism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/20/business/martin-marietta-dow-drop-venture.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Martin Marietta, Dow Drop Venture", "print_headline": "Martin Marietta, Dow Drop Venture", "body_text": " **********The Dow Chemical Company and the Martin Marietta Corporation said they had abandoned a plan to form a joint specialty chemicals marketing venture. **********The one-sentence announcement said the companies ''will explore potential alternative business approaches in the specialty chemicals field.''

Sakharov emerged here today in a letter said to have been written by the dissident Soviet physicist from Gorky, the industrial city to which he has been confined for six years. **********In the letter, printed in The Observer, a Sunday newspaper, Dr. Sakharov describes how he was taken into custody while accompanying his wife to an interrogation at the prosecutor's office in Gorky on May 7, 1984. He says his abductors said they were doctors but were actually agents of the K.G.B., the Soviet internal-security agency. **********At the time of his abduction, the Nobel Peace Prize winner was in the fifth day of a hunger strike designed to press the authorities into granting a visa to his wife, Yelena G. Bonner, so she could go abroad for medical treatment. The trip was finally permitted last October, just before President Reagan's meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, in Geneva. **********Dr. Sakharov was taken to Semashko Hospital in Gorky, where he was detained under guard, the letter says, and cut off from visits by his wife for four months. On May 11, his fifth day in the hospital and the 10th day of his fast, he was bound to his bed and connected to an intravenous feeder. Vision and Handwriting Distorted **********When he awoke, the letter says, his vision of the orderlies in his room was ''strangely distorted as on a television screen affected by strong interference.'' **********His handwriting was also distorted, it goes on, in a manner typical of patients who have suffered strokes. **********Intravenous feeding was continued until May 16, when he was forcibly fed through a tube in the nose, a method the letter describes as ''bearable, if painful.'' **********On May 25, what the letter calls ''the most excrutiating, degrading and barbarous method'' was begun and lasted for three days. Again, Dr. Sakharov was bound. This time breathing through the nose, the letter says, was prevented by a clamp. When he opened his mouth, a meat broth was spooned in. Sometimes his jaws were pried open. Once fed, his jaws were held shut until he had swallowed. **********''I experienced a continuing feeling of suffocation,'' he said, ''aggravated by the position of my body and head. I had to gasp for breath. I could feel the veins on the verge of bursting.'' Rights Purchased in U.S.  Rights to publish the letter, along with other handwritten letters, documents and photographs, were purchased by The Observer from Dr. Sakharov's family in the United States for a price reported to have been $42,600, plus a share of world rights. The authenticity of the material was confirmed by Efrem Yankelevich, Miss Bonner's son-in-law, who said it came in the mail to his home in Newton, Mass. **********The American rights to the material were subsequently purchased by U.S. News & World Report, which will publish it in two installments, beginning Monday. **********The long letter that appeared in The Observer was addressed to Dr. Anatoly P. Aleksandrov, president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, of which Dr. Sakharov is still a member. **********After describing the forced feeding, the letter explains that Dr. Sakharov agreed to swallow voluntarily on May 27, the third day after the clamp was placed on his nose, in exchange for the removal of the clamp so that he could breathe normally. **********The letter describes his feelings of guilt over what he calls weakness and anxiety about the condition of his wife, whose letters were mostly intercepted by the authorities. His doctors sought to convince him, it goes on, that another fast would induce Parkinson's disease and reduce him to helplessness. On Sept. 7, four months after his abduction, Dr. Sakharov finally began another hunger strike. **********This time, instead of forcibly feeding him, the authorities indicated that he would be reunited with his wife if he broke his fast.

He said the paper was directed by ''agents of the United States Government acting with financing provided by the United States Government.'' **********La Prensa had received a $100,000 grant from the National Endowment for Democracy, a private American group that channels Government money to foreign institutions, predominantly in countries where democracy is deemed fragile or nonexistent. Editors said they needed the aid as a supply of hard currency with which to do business, because the Government did not have enough available to sell. **********Sandinistas run both of Nicaragua's remaining daily newspapers, as well as both television channels and most radio stations.

'At Heart, I'm a Sportswriter' **********''I think of myself as a Catholic who supports democracy, nothing more,'' he said. ''I don't want to be classed as a counterrevolutionary. At heart, I'm a sportswriter.'' **********Mr. Sanchez began his career in 1977 as host of a radio sports show in his home town of Granada. **********Two years later, the Sandinistas swept into power. Because the owner of the station in Granada had been a local administrator of the state-owned electric company, he was declared ineligible to control a news outlet. **********The station was seized, and Mr. Sanchez had to take his show elsewhere. **********He went to Radio Mil, whose owner, Fabio Gadea, was a close friend and political ally of Alfonso Robelo Callejas, then a member of the junta. The Sanchez show, ''Sports Comment,'' flourished on Radio Mil for two years. **********But Mr. Gadea upset the Sandinistas by demanding that he be allowed to open a private television station to compete with the two run by the Government. His patron, Mr. Robelo, resigned from the junta and eventually left the country to join the rebel cause. Radio Mil was confiscated, and Mr. Sanchez was again without a radio outlet. **********Early in 1984, ''Sports Comment'' emerged again, this time on the radio station of the Roman Catholic Church. Every midday, Mr. Sanchez and his guests could be heard arguing over such subjects as who should manage the national baseball team or whether Marvelous Marvin Hagler had any peer in boxing. **********On the last day of 1985, all radio stations in the country were ordered to transmit President Ortega's year-end speech. In what the Sandinistas took as a gesture of disrespect, the Catholic station joined the hookup late. It was ordered shut the next day, and Mr. Sanchez was on the street a third time. Reporters, But No Assignments **********The only steady work remaining for him was at La Prensa, which had been carrying his columns and game reports for several years. In the June 25 issue, his preview of the Central American and Caribbean Games led the sports section. But that was the last day the paper was permitted to publish. On the afternoon of June 26, the Government informed La Prensa that it was being closed ''for an indefinite time.'' **********Today, a week later, La Prensa does not have the look of a newspaper that is shut down.

Most of the employees have been given 15 days of paid vacation. **********There is no indication that the Government plans to allow La Prensa to reopen any time soon. Nor has there been any sign that its property will be taken over to be used to publish another paper. **********Somewhat to the surprise of editors, troops have not occupied the office complex and printing installations. The Prospect of Exile **********Some of La Prensa's editors, for example Juan Navarro, think they may be forced to leave Nicararagua. **********''After working at La Prensa for 11 years, I'm kind of persona non grata as long as this Government is in power,'' Mr. Navarro said. ''I don't like mass marches, shouting slogans, or ideologies that try to manipulate you. It may be time to look for other horizons.'' **********Mr. Navarro says he has friends abroad who might help him find a job, but he has not called them yet. **********''Exile is something very painful,'' he said. ''I don't know if I'm ready for it.'' **********Mr. Navarro said he would like work that was not overtly political. He said he would not join an organ like Nicaragua Hoy, a four-page anti-Sandinista weekly that circulates with newspapers in Costa Rica, Guatemala and several other countries. **********Among the editors of Nicaragua Hoy is Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Barrios, who was editor of La Prensa until he left Nicaragua in December 1984. Mr. Chamorro is a son of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Cardenal, who was assassinated while editor of La Prensa in 1978, in an attack considered one of the major events that led to the uprising that overthrew President Anastasio Somoza Debayle the following year. After the overthrow, another son, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, became editor of Barricada, the official Sandinista newspaper. **********Now, without La Prensa, Nicaraguans will probably rely even more heavily on radio, the information medium that reaches the largest number of people in this country. There are several non-Government radio news programs, but all operate under a form of self-censorship in which they must observe limits set by the Government. **********Many Nicaraguans have begun to listen regularly to radio stations from nearby countries. Most of these stations are strongly anti-Sandinista and some, for example Radio Impacto in Costa Rica, broadcast large amounts of news about Nicaragua because they know they have a large audience here. **********Listeners in some parts of the country can also receive the clandestine station of the Nicaraguan rebels, Radio September 15. It has a reputation for exaggeration, however. **********Mr. Sanchez, who appears bemused rather than embittered by his experiences, is hoping the Government will let him open a weekly sports tabloid."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/28/business/finance-new-issues-san-antonio-issue-yields-up-to-7.40.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SAN ANTONIO ISSUE YIELDS UP TO 7.40%", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; SAN ANTONIO ISSUE YIELDS UP TO 7.40%", "body_text": " **********San Antonio is offering $172 million of prior lien sewer system revenue improvement and refunding bonds with a maximum yield of 7.40 percent for a 7 1/4 percent issue due in 2012 at a price of 98.278.

''I wanted to comfort other people going through what I went through.'' **********Ms. Latham is one of the new breed of professionals entering the funeral services industry. Ten years ago, perhaps two-thirds of the 1,500 students in the several dozen mortuary schools around the country came from families already in the business; today that figure has dropped to a third. And according to Todd W. Van Beck, chairman of the mortuary science department at Hudson Valley Community College in upstate New York, during the same time period the percentage of women students has increased from less than 1 percent, to 12 percent. **********Those changes are the result of a concerted effort on the part of the funeral industry to upgrade its somewhat ghoulish, gravedigger image. When Victor Scalise became president of Ms. Latham's school in 1977, for example, he changed the name from the New England Institute of Anatomy, Sanitary Science and Embalming to the New England Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences and went on to broaden the curriculum to other fields. He has added extensive course work on the psychology of death and bereavement and some only vaguely funereal courses in communications and public speaking and the use of computers. The school, like others in the field, now advertises extensively in trade publications and recruits students at high school and college career days. **********''Many people would like to be part of a care-giving profession but believe that funeral professionals only deal in dead bodies,'' said Mr. Scalise. ''Actually, 90 percent of the time is spent with the living.'' **********The push for a better image has a new obstacle to hurdle, though: the refusal of some funeral directors to handle the bodies of AIDS patients. An ongoing survey conducted by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the New York-based AIDS service organization, found that of almost 400 metropolitan-area funeral homes telephoned, fewer than 20 percent agreed to be listed as resources for families of AIDS patients. ''The rest have done everything from not taking our calls or hanging up to being abusive or saying they charge up to $750 extra to handle the body,'' said the Gay Men's Health Crisis ombudsman, Robert Cecchi. **********To combat the situation, mortuary schools, as well as professional trade associations, are scheduling increasing numbers of seminars on the issue. They are also releasing guidelines and policies stressing that when properly handled, the bodies of people who died of AIDS pose no danger to embalmers, other funeral home employees or those attending funeral services.

On Covert Operations **********Speaking about covert operations, which he strongly supports, Mr. Shultz said: ''Free nations accustomed to open debate are naturally uneasy about covert measures, just as they are uneasy about the ambiguous circumstances that require us to act in secret. **********''Yet we must remember that intelligence breakthroughs and secret operations had a decisive influence on our victories in two world wars,'' he said. ''Today, in our shadow war against terrorism, the use of these instruments is just as imperative. The United States will use such measures legally, properly and with due involvement of designated legislative committees.'' **********''What is crucial is the ability to take some initiatives quietly, in situations where the more the measures are known, the less effective will be their results,'' he said. **********Mr. Shultz has been outpoken in his criticism of disclosures of covert operations, arguing that such ''leaks'' made the war against terrorists more difficult. Comments on Disclosures **********On Wednesday, for instance, Mr. Shultz said such disclosures ''undercut our ability to act effectively against terrorists.'' **********''Suppose you get somebody somehow infiltrated into one of these terrorist gangs and you get some information and so when you get it, bang, it gets leaked.'' **********''It's very juicy information and publicized all over the place,'' he said. ''What have you got out of that? You've got a dead person that helped you and you've turned off anybody else who might help you.'' **********He said, ''There used to be a lot more restraint on the part of the press on what they would run and print or publish, and when they would do it.'' **********''As far as our Government is concerned, it's a gusher,'' he complained. ''It's disgusting the way stuff leaks out, and we've got to find the people who are doing it and fire them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/04/world/around-the-world-floods-in-china-kill-at-least-233.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Floods in China Kill at Least 233", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Floods in China Kill at Least 233", "body_text": " **********Floods have killed 233 people in the southwest China province of Yunnan over the past few days, the China Daily reported today. **********The newspaper gave no further details of the Yunnan floods but said recent flooding in the northeast province of Jilin had affected nearly two million people and 2.5 million acres of farmland. **********It said air force planes had been sent to rescue 60,000 people cut off by floodwaters in Inner Mongolia.

''I think this budget pulsates with the inspiration of the poor,'' Finance Minister Zail Singh told reporters this weekend. ''We have committed it to their service.'' **********An aide said they also reflected the Prime Minister's ''personal philosophy'' of accelerating efforts for the poor, now that India had achieved an economic growth rate of about 5 percent. Passage Expected **********The proposed budget, which covers the fiscal year beginning April 1, is expected to pass easily in Parliament because Mr. Gandhi's ruling Congress Party controls 80 percent of the votes. **********The criticism of Mr. Gandhi as indifferent to the poor began last year after the Prime Minister slashed business regulations and taxes for corporations and individuals. **********Critics noted that Mr. Gandhi's mother and predecessor, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, often ran for re-election by promising to attack poverty. By contrast, experts said last year that Mr. Gandhi's policies recalled those espoused by President Reagan in the United States. **********Business executives were elated, and the stock markets have boomed, but many Indians, including many in the Congress Party, have not found the comparison flattering. Sharpening Attacks **********Last month, the political attacks on Mr. Gandhi sharpened after an announcement of higher prices for gasoline and petroleum products. Protests, demonstrations and strikes erupted across India, creating a serious political problem for the Prime Minister. **********In Parliament last week, Mr. Gandhi denounced the strikes and repeatedly defended the Government as a champion of the less well-to-do. **********On Friday evening, when Mr. Singh presented the Government's $40 billion budget, his announcement of the new anti-poverty programs brought thunderous applause from lawmakers. **********Some who had earlier criticized the Government said the budget was an improvement, although most opposition politicians said Mr. Gandhi still did not care about the poor. **********The range of increases in poverty programs appeared to be considerable. Funding for such programs was increased an average of 65 percent -''One of the highest hikes in one year that ever has happened,'' according to Mr. Singh. **********Among the anti-poverty programs to be increased are those involving child nutrition, food allocation, housing and job creation. The budget listed the total of these programs as about $3 billion. Subsidized Loans **********Also announced was a new subsidized loan scheme for poor urban tradesmen, such as hawkers, cobblers, rickshaw pullers and barbers. **********Most analysts say that about one-third of Indians live below the ''poverty line,'' but at least one-half of the population of 750 million is living on subsistence levels. **********Nevertheless, poverty is believed to have decreased in the last year, and starvation almost eliminated. Hunger and malnutrition are still major problems, however. **********A year ago, Mr. Singh was emphasizing benefits for Indian business and industry as a spur to economic growth. This weekend, he declared that the policy had been vindicated. He said revenues from all the major taxes had surged by more than 20 percent, even though tax rates were cut. Political Event **********As in the United States, the presentation of a new budget is a major political event in India. Hundreds of people mobbed the corridors of Parliament or waited outside the huge multicolumned building, eager for copies. The Indian budget is especially important because it represents more than 20 percent of the country's gross national product, estimated at about $200 billion for the coming year. **********The budget contained a large number of revenue proposals that affected virtually everyone who pays taxes. A principal revision called for simplification in the collection of excise taxes, designed to lower rates but bring in more revenues because of less costly procedures. **********Many people were skeptical that businesses would actually pass the benefits on to consumers, however. **********The Finance Minister has been widely attacked for recent price increases in oil, fertilizers and food grains. The tax cuts for wage earners, plus other tax breaks, were apparently aimed at softening the blow of these price increases, especially in cities, where the criticism has become highly vocal. Mixed Blessing **********In contrast to last year, the business community found the new budget a mixed blessing. **********Several new business tax breaks and incentives were announced, particularly for small-scale businesses that manufacture industrial machinery and those that can export their products. **********But there was no major overall expansion of incentives such as the ones last year, and some tax breaks that had been promised were postponed ''in the interest of revenue.'' An industry spokesman criticized some steps as ''retrograde.'' **********The budget also reflected rising concern about another outgrowth of Mr. Gandhi's policies - the growing Indian trade deficit. **********Mr. Gandhi was widely praised a year ago for making it easier for businesses to import machinery, electronics and other items. But as a result, India's trade balance has worsened considerably. **********Reversing course somewhat, the new budget calls for increased duties on the importing of industrial machinery, although there will be a reduction of duties on machinery components that can be assembled in India. **********A final controversial aspect of the budget was its $3 billion deficit, equal to less than 2 percent of the gross national product. Some economists worry about the size, but Mr. Singh said he did not. ''I think we can absorb this deficit,'' he declared. ''It's not high.''"}}
